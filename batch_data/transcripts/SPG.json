(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Liz Zale, Senior VP of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed. Liz Zale : Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to Simon Property Group's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer, and we are also joined by Tom Ward, our new Vice President of Investor Relations.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available online at investors.simon.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good morning. We had strong start to the year. Results in the quarter were led by FFO $2.38 per share, up 16.1% from the first quarter of 2013. Once again our FFO significantly exceeded the first call consensus estimate. Our growth strategy continues to generate significant value for our business. Overall business conditions are positive. Demand for space in our portfolio remain strong. Leasing activity is helping. We had occupancy growth of 80 basis points compared to Q1 2013 in the quarter is 95.5%, accelerating releasing spreads to $9.90 per square foot. Our comp NOI growth for malls and outlets was 3.7% despite higher cost from utilities and snow removal. If we normalize this, this affected our comp by roughly 90 basis points and as a point of reference comp NOI including The Mills and excluding the malls to be spun-off as part of WP was 5.3% for the quarter including the high cost of snow and utility removal. Now as reported, our retail sales were essentially flat and I would encourage you to look at our revenues as opposed to our retailer sales. As you know, if we had underperforming retailers we have the ability to replace them with better retailers at generally higher rents which generates higher SPG revenues and as I have said repeatedly current retail sales does not correlate to our ability to grow our cash flow and as a reminder, our consolidated revenues, the revenues that I focus on, grew by 8.2% for the year. These results are testament to the strength of our assets and the desirability of our locations. Now development construction continues on new premium outlets in Charlotte, Minneapolis, Montr\u00e9al and Vancouver, all high quality major markets and that remains our only focus in new development is in those kind of markets. Other new outlet projects in our development pipeline are moving forward. We have up to six additional new outlets expected to start construction in 2014 and 2015. Redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing at 29 properties in the U.S., Asia and Mexico. We started construction on two important redevelopment projects in our portfolio. They include the relocation of Bloomingdale's at Stanford Mall in Palo Alto and the redevelopment of its former location to add 120,000 new square feet of space for small shops and restaurants and the relocation of Saks Fifth Avenue at Houston Galleria to a new prototype store plus the redevelopment of that existing of Saks and an expansion adding the 105000 square feet of luxury retail and restaurants. We also started construction on the expansion of Yeoju premium outlets in Seoul, Korea. That will add approximately 259,000 square feet and we have a healthy pipeline of other premium outlet expansion projects in the works. Desert Hills premium outlets in celebrating the opening of its expansion beginning this Thursday, adding 147,000 square feet and it is fully an example. As an example, the annualized NOI from this expansion will add $17 million to SPG's NOI, as it's a wholly-owned asset. Construction is ongoing to expand and enhance some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common, Lenox Square and Del Amo to name a few. Overall we continue to expect redevelopment investments of at least $1 billion annually through 2016 that will contribute incremental growth in NOI and strengthen the position of our assets in the respective geographic areas. On Kl\u00e9pierre, the transformative Carrefour deal selling 126 smaller assets for nearly \u20ac2 billion closed last week. McArthurGlen, our new investment in the outlet business in Europe is performing well. Our deal signed transactions during the first quarter included our acquisition of the remaining interest in Kravco Simon which held interest in a portfolio of 10 assets including King of Prussia Mall which we now own 100% and the acquisition of Arizona Mills bringing our interest to that center of 100% as well as development land in Oyster Bay, Long Island from the Taubman Centers. Just an update on Washington Prime Group. WP spin-off of 98 assets including our strip center business is expected to be completed in the second quarter. Recent activities include announced members of senior management team, an independent Board of Directors including Mark Orban as CEO. We are pleased also today to announce that Mark Richards will be joining WP as CFO. He is well respected and has worked with Mark successfully at Sunrise Senior Living. We received indicative investment grade range from three major credit agencies as follows, S&P BBB, Moody's BAA2, Fitch BBB. All three agencies provided a stable outlook. Very strong ratings out-of-the-box and comparable to many REITs that have been rated for a long time. The balance sheet will be ready to enable the company in its pursuit of cash flow growth. Completed financing activities on WP. Nine mortgages were closed in unsecured facility comprised of a $900 million revolving credit facility and a $500 million term loan were completed. Now let me turn to the SPG capital markets update. We completed a $1.2 billion senior unsecured notes offering in January with a weighted average duration of 7.5 years at an average coupon rate of 2.975%. The 65 basis point spread over treasuries for the five-year tranche is the tightest five years spread ever for a REIT. On March 14 Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to A. We are now at the mid-A level with all three of the agencies leading the REIT industry. We closed or locked rates on four new secured loans in the quarter totaling $860 million of which our share was $491 million and we expect to generate $1 billion of cash proceeds from the WP spin upon its completion. Early in April, we amended and extended our $4 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility to a June 2019 final maturity and we are able to reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 80 basis points on LIBOR plus 95 basis points, again the best in the market. We raised the dividend again this quarter to a $1.30 per share. That's an increase of $0.05 per share from last quarter and a year-over-year increase of 13%. We will pay at SPG at least $5.15 per common share in 2014 not including the WP expected dividend. As we said to you originally the WP expected dividend will create an overall effective dividend of $5.65 or another at least $0.50 on a one-for-one basis for WP spin. Now let's go to guidance. We revised our 2014 guidance upwards to $9.60 to $9.70 of FFO per share. This incorporates our strong performance in the first quarter. It raises both the top and the bottom by $0.10. It's based upon an annual comp NOI growth of at least 4% for combined mall and outlet portfolio. This FFO guidance is comparable basis with our 2013 results and ignores any potentially impact of the WP spin. Once the spin-off is completed, we will provide updated guidance through a press release reflecting what the impact of SPG will be for the balance of the year. So overall, we had a strong start to the year. We are absolutely focused on creating value for our properties and for our tenants and for our shareholders and now we are ready for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Thanks. Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Hi, David. I can appreciate your comment about tenant sales, how that doesn't directly impact your business short-term, but I was wondering if you guys could maybe try and isolate what the weather impact was and if you or Rick could maybe talk about regional sales performance and did you see any differences in places like Florida, Texas and California versus the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest? David Simon : I would refute your first statement, Steve, and I would suggest to you that the most important thing in terms of growing our cash flow is in fact what the market rents of our space are which are not determined by what current retailers are producing out of that space and what our rollover schedule looks like. And in fact if you see our rent spreads of nearly $10 per foot, that would indicate exactly, sure we do have some risk to overage rent as sales ebb and flow, but the fact of the matter is recurrent retail sales generally don't have an impact. And take an example, there are a number of the retailers that are really not performing that well for each one have a variety of reasons. That's in our sales numbers for our retailers, yet that has nothing to do with what the market value of that space can be. And so again, you should be obsessed with our sales. I am obsessed with our revenues, the SPG revenues. Retailers come and go. If we were worried about retail sales, this company was originally built, we had Kmart as our anchors. And if we had looked at Kmart sales, we would have suggested that our sales or our revenues could never grow, but in fact what we do here is we are able to replace underperforming retailers with better retailers and we are able to garner the market rent of what our space should be and that continues to go up. So this is not a short-term issue. This is an issue that's existed for the balance of this 50 year history of this company. So now Rick can mention regional, fact of the matter is, sure the weather, this company will never use weather as an excuse. It certainly affected our comp NOI by 90 basis points because of high utility snow. We often talk about the winter. That's in our rearview mirror. It certainly had an impact on our retailers that exist in our buildings, but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the fact that our business is solid. It has the ability to grow its cash flow. We have a long demonstrated track record of being able to do that and we will continue to do that but the markets that didn't have snow, et cetera, they were not as effective in terms of those retailers are reporting. I do remind you that the like to remind that the strip center which don't even report tenant sales, but Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything to it. Rick Sokolov : I do. One thing, not only do we not use weather as an excuse with you. We do not allow our operating teams in any of our platforms to use weather as an excuse and we expect those results to be delivered. You will not be surprised to hear that the better markets where the Pacific, Florida, the Southwest and Las Vegas. And the markets that were most impacted by the weather were the Plains, the Great Lakes and the Mid-Atlantic. No great insights there, but as David said, we are managing through. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Okay, thanks, and then just on the leasing front. I know most of the leasing is done for this year, but Rick can you give us some insight as to what kind of leasing is done for next year? Rick Sokolov : We are right on track with our leasing renewals and leasing the space this year and as we sit here today we are right where we were last year this time for this year, but there is increasing demand. As David said, our job is to curate our properties and bring in the most productive and the growing tenants and eliminate or downsize the tenants that are least provocative. And that's what we do on an ongoing basis. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman - Citi: Yes, actually this is Michael Bilerman, Citi. David, I just had one question just in terms of global expansion. I wasn't sure if your British conference call coordinator was on purpose or not. We are sort of yellow this business is clearly global. You have moved that global on all the regions. How do you feel about traditional retail and where are your thoughts are about that side of the business and pursuing more global expansion? David Simon : Well, look, we have a great outlet platform in Asia. In fact, Stanley is over in Asia, I guess, tomorrow. It's tomorrow, right? So technically, here today ahead of our self. So we are looking at other Southeast Asia markets to expand our platform. We have been really successful everywhere in Asia in the outlet business. Japan, Korea, Malaysia. There is a number of Southeastern markets, not China, that are that are very interesting to us. So I would expect Michael to hopefully be able to build some new centers there. We have a good outlet potential in Mexico where we got a couple of new sites that we are pursuing aggressively, including the expansion of our one outlet there. The Brazilian outlet opportunity is somewhat dormant at this point. I couldn't find the right sites in the market know. We were fortuitous in that the market obviously is correcting there. So we have no capital at risk and we have nothing unnecessarily planned there. And then we have got McArthurGlen which we are very excited about not just the assets that we have interest in but also the development and management platform as well as some of their new expansion opportunities and new development. I was over there a couple weeks ago looking at one of their opportunities. So we think that that business will become more important to us over time. Turning to the full price, I think our model will continue to be opportunistic. We love in retrospect what happened at Kl\u00e9pierre. We went in there before anybody thought about investing in European real estate based upon two fundamental beliefs. One is that the cash flow is very sticky. So far so good, ex-Spain, which in fact was not very sticky but it means less and less to us now that we have sold this huge portfolio the Carrefour. We can help the company from a strategic point of view and get them retail focused and all the other things that we have been doing. Help them become better operators. All of which have, in fact, scarily have gone according to plan. So we want to be opportunistic. There is a lot of capital now in Europe. The U.K. is not a real focus for us. Prices are not necessarily cheap and they are not opportunistic and we had a disappointing experience there in retrospect to shareholders and the Board should have thought, the shareholders technically never get an opportunity but the Board should probably thought about it's response a little bit more thoroughly than it did. But that said, we are going to continue to be opportunistic. This is not glamorous and it's primarily the focus is if we can add and export our ability and the number one goal is to make money. I have no interest in building monuments. Christy McElroy - Citi: Hi, David, it's Christy here. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your new Simon Venture Group. Are you spending any time on this personally? How much capital what you anticipate investing over time? What sort of returns are you looking at? Can you give us some examples of the types of companies you are looking at? David Simon : Well, sure. We have just hired Skyler Fernandes, who has early stage VC experience. We have made a couple of small investments before Skyler's involvement, with Jifiti and shopkick, I am sorry, I almost said Shop and Trick, which have been small investments and it's really the primary focus is in areas where we think it's going to apply the investment or the business model will apply to our physical environment. It could be a new retailer. It could be a new restaurant. It can be a new technology that is important to our consumers and our retailer. I think over time we could invest anywhere from $25 million to $50 million. We are going to do it very small. We don't want to have a big staff. If Skyler is listening, Skyler, you are going to have to do most of this on your own. I am involved. I met a couple of hours yesterday. We have got a couple of, these are $1 million up to $5 million investments a piece, but it's really trying to of focus on bettering our product, and we can do that through new retailers, restaurants. We can do that through new technology. We can do with through new services and we can do it in a way that can help our retailers who like the live which in fact is on the forefront of ultimately providing same-day delivery services to our consumers which seems to resonate with a number of our consumer. So that's the theory. It's going to morph. The good news is we only have really two investment mistakes over time that I called material, not material but, in China we only have got $0.75 on $1, but we learned that in China you have to be very careful. We also investment in technology in the late 90s. We learned a lot from that. The whole model has changed now because that actually had great ideas there but investing in building the stuff, this was before the cloud. We had to buy the routers, the servers. You had to build everything. Now you can essentially rent it all out. The economics is such that you are never going to have that kind of capital at risk to see whether or not a new idea or a new technology can germinate to something that's meaningful to our portfolio. Christy McElroy - Citi: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the issue with the tenant sales talking about previously that the tenant sales doesn't matter but it's really the cash flow. Presumably the cost of occupancy overtime does matter. Its highlight of the team retailers. Should we assume that, given the comments on team retailers that ex that you are feeling quite good and confident about cost of occupancy overall? David Simon : Well, yes, look, our business has, over its 50 year history, and 20 years as a public company where we produced unbelievable results, but we ask retailers that get hot, get cold, new concept, old concept. It's just the nature of our business. And again, occupancy costs are determined at a particular point in time, but it doesn't necessarily equate to what the market value of that rent is or that space is, because again that sale that's being generated out of that space is that particular retailer and that particular retailer could not be generating the sales that that particular space should be generating, That's where it relies on us to either relocate them or replace them with a newer better retailer. So again, if you looked at our top 10 tenants 20 years ago versus today and if you looked at our cash flow growth 20 years ago to today, despite all of the noise about particular retailers here in near, there is such strong evidence to support my statement. So occupancy costs is interesting but it's not a factor in what our ability to generate cash flow growth is. You have to look at the rollover schedule and how that equates to market rents, and market rents are determined based upon supply and demand. So in the office sector, you do the same thing. In the strip center sector, you do the same thing. In the industrial sector, you do the same thing. But here, for whatever reason, the mall industry has gotten away from cash flow growth as the important determinant in what the value of our company is and more what are the existing retailer sales. I don't buy that and I have never run this company based upon that and our track record is evidence of that. I don't know what else to tell you. Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you. Rick Sokolov : The only thing I would add is, that the underlying David's point about supply and demand, there is virtually no new supply. If you look over the last six years, supply has been growing 50 bips a year lower than the rate of our population growth. So we are in a very good supply dynamic for the foreseeable future. David Simon : And again, retailers, it ebbs and it flows. Sometimes there is more retailers that are under pressure than sometimes not but you cannot replicate our buildings. You cannot build it. There is no new supply. And supply and demand is in our favor. Otherwise we couldn't grow our cash flow. It's that simple. And I encourage everybody. I hope this doesn't sound defensive but I encourage everybody to understand how we run the business, where we run it over a long period of time. We are always replacing retailers. Some of toughest calls that Rick and I get are the ones when we move an underperforming retailer out for a better performing retailer and the retailers that are underperforming, the fact that they could be there for five, 10 years and their rents are way under market. And it may look bad in their sales, but the fact is, it's welcome from us because we can replace them with a better tenants. Let's take lease settlement income as part of that discussion. The fact is that if somebody, like we had some recent settlement income. Sony is exiting the mall business. Sony is in A malls. If they pay me the present value of being in that space and I get that space back and I can lease it for current market value, you and me, you are not made of shareholders and analysts but you in a sense represent shareholders. You and me, have just done a good deed. We now get the present value of that space obligation. I get the space back. I can lease it for market rent. That's a win for us. And again, you have seen that over a period of time with retailers and the lease settlement income is being generated by our top centers. For whatever reason, certain retailers are not wanting to get out of the business or not performing well at this center has nothing to do with that center. Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : Thank you, and I guess one question in terms of the cash flow. There is a comment in terms of the NOI growth, ex-WP being 5.3%. Should we compare that 5.3% to 3.7%? And it would seem then that WP had much lower NOI growth but presumably a lot of the assets being in the Midwest and some in Mid-Atlantic would have some impact there. David Simon : Well the real important thing we did was we put in The Mills there, which generated -- one of the things we are thinking about comments are welcome, is that we have not historically put The Mills comp NOI growth in our overall comp NOI but once the spin is done it's likely, we are happy to give input on this, it is likely that we will then put that in our comp NOI because these are big cash flow generating assets and it's probably they are the bigger assets which is consistent with what SPG is doing going forward focused on the bigger assets and it will probably be on our comp NOI pool. So we wanted to give you a flavor of what that comp NOI growth would be including The Mills. And there is some marginal benefit of the fact that if you were taking out the WP assets but it's marginal and you are correct in saying that because of the snow and utility costs and a lot of those centers are located in the areas the got whacked in the first quarter, you are correct in saying that that had some impact on that comp NOI as it did for SPG as a whole. Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of MLV. Please proceed. Paul Morgan - MLV: Hi. Good morning. David, I think your comment about market rent for space not being related to what the existing retailer is doing and I think maybe one of those, a great example might be just replacing department store space with small shops, any upside you see there, kind of like what you are doing at Stanford, but give us any sense of how many of those opportunities are in your pipeline? You announced a couple projects. The Phipps and the Pentagon City but is this something you are having discussions with department stores increasingly where they can you maybe downsize and you can recapture space at much higher rents? Any color? David Simon : We are always looking for that and I will let Rick comment on it. It's interesting though while that neither one of those guys are leaving. They are actually getting new stores in that process but we are able to make the economics work because of the supply and demand of those particular assets. They are both antiquated physical plans. So we are able to make a win-win out of it in that we reclaim REIT demise their existing space, turn over to small shops. They get a brand new prototype store and it's a win-win but part of the lease settlement income that we generate in the first quarter was the full present value of the fact obligation for the mall where they paid us. They are leaving shortly. Rick Sokolov : They are under construction. David Simon : And we are going to reclaim that for small shops that's a mall that's close to $1,000 a foot, something like that. But thee is a handful of those. Rick you want to add? There are a handful of those kind of opportunities. Rick Sokolov : And we are constantly mining the portfolio. We just announced literally an expansion at Pentagon. We have announced, David just talked about Florida mall. And both of those are just in addition to all of the things we completed over the last year and obviously we are always talking with our department stores about where they got space that we believe could be better deployed and we are in constant conversations about whether we can put it to better use. And sometimes it happens independent of us. A great example of that is DICK'S that is being added in one levels Sears in King of Prussia that we have basically done inside the Sears store but that's going to make that property substantially more productive by having DICK'S anchor around one level in Sears consolidating in a more productive box on one level. Paul Morgan - MLV: My other question is related, but I think there has obviously been a lot of headlines about not just sales but mall traffic and then we have had a tick up in bankruptcies and store closing announcements and so but what you don't hear as much about is the retailers who are looking to backfill that space. Maybe I don't know, Rick, if you have some color about people who, for example, would be looking to take the Coldwater Creek stores that are liquidating or folks like that who have upped their store opening targets? Rick Sokolov : David always makes fun of me when I rattle of the list of the tenants but the good news is that there is a very vibrant of group of tenants that are looking to expand. Lego, Athleta, H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, just a few, and Topshop, we are adding Topshop's in three places in the portfolio. There are, to David's point, historically there have always been tenant that are looking to do business in productive properties and to the extent the space we are getting back is in productive properties and happily that's the vast majority of our portfolio. We have users and we have demand at better rents and the opportunity to rightsize the space. Paul Morgan - MLV: Great. Thanks. David Simon : Yes, and just a comment on traffic. I would suggest to you that when a retailer talks about traffic, that may be their particular stores and may not be endemic of the mall's traffic and I would also caution, throw significant caution to the wind that there are a couple of, one company in particular that holds themselves out as the barometer of traffic in the mall industry and there data does not include any common area or inference data from the Simon Property Group and many other mall owners of a quality real estate and we don't know how and in fact what that traffic is that they report. So I just want to throw caution to the wind when you hear these general statements about traffic. Was traffic affected by the winter? And the fact is that malls, we have some statistic, which I don't even remember but how many days our malls were closed compared to last year was 10x of what it was. So that can happen. It happened. I just want you to throw caution to the wind when the media quotes traffic numbers, understand the source of that and its accuracy. Paul Morgan - MLV: So you are saying your portfolio is doing better than what they are saying for the industry? David Simon : I am saying, our traffic was affected by the weather and I am saying you look at our results and that gives you an indication of what's going on our portfolio. Paul Morgan - MLV: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital. David Harris - Imperial Capital : Good morning, everybody. The Carrefour sale by Kl\u00e9pierre, does that prompt any consideration for special dividend under the French REIT rules, David? David Simon : No. The answer is no, because they have the ability to straddle years a little bit like this as well and they are also unwinding some hedges as part of that because they were over hedged. So there is some losses associate with that. The fact is, it will not end up in a situation where there is an unusual dividend spike. Dividend has been growing. Expect that to probably continue but there won't be something extraordinary associated with that sale. David Harris - Imperial Capital : So the proceeds will be essentially used to delever the company, at least the initial thought? David Simon : Correct. That's correct. David Harris - Imperial Capital : Okay. Does that leave you looking for acquisitions in that company now as we go forward? Or are you happy with a lower level of leverage? David Simon : No, I think the company is now in a position that it can look for opportunities, whether new development, expansions, some acquisitions here and there but they are clearly focused on, given the significant change they are very focused on growing the business now which two years ago when we got there, I would say it was a different scenario. So thankfully they have executed extremely well and they are looking for growth similar to what all major retail owners do. Do some developments, some expansion, some potential acquisitions here and there. David Harris - Imperial Capital : Now your estimable CFO has not yet been given a speaking part, but I just wondered if there is any update on his replacement. David Simon : Well, unfortunately, you have asked a question where he can't respond to that either. David Harris - Imperial Capital : Well, I don't give great quarter, guys, but I wanted to throw in a compliment. Steve Sterrett : Thank you. David Simon : A pat on the back never hurts from anybody. So in any event, as you know we have been, it's very interesting, this company again, there is lot that gets lost in sauce. On one hand this week, we were going to open Desert Hills. It's going to be 100% leased and it's going to add $70 million of cash flow the company. At the same time, we hired a new venture guy. Europe is doing well. You got all the redevelopment. We are doing the WP deal, right and then obviously I have got the focus on Steve's replacement. So just from a, my point of view here, and this is probably, I am telling the people here, they are probably looking for me to say what I am going to say. So I have been thinking long and hard about this and as you know, the biggest focus we had over the last two or three months has been WP. That management team is basically set, done, which is very good news and it's a great team. They are young, energetic. It's got a mix of Simon trained folks. It's got our strip center entrepreneurial group and then it's got the outsider and a couple of his colleagues that I think ultimately will create their unique dynamic company that's really going to be hustling for growth. Now that that's said and it looks like the spin is, again subject to Board approval, winding around the last corner. I have been thinking more and more about this and I will probably have an opinion in a month or two but right now I am seriously considering internal candidates as the first line of defense. The good news is, we have got a great bench. We got guys that are savvy veterans, younger people that want to move up. We have a great culture here, and I think we can do it internally but I don't want to rush to judgment. I want WP to get done and then I think once that gets done, something could happen in the next four to eight weeks. That's probably news to everybody in this room but therein lies my thinking. So I hope you appreciate the honesty of my response. David Harris - Imperial Capital : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ki Bin of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ki Bin - SunTrust: Thanks. I had just a couple of follow-ups. In terms of traffic data and your tenant replacement commentary, could you just talk a little bit, we are midway through April, almost May now and I wouldn't say it has been very warm, but have you seen some kind of catch up in the past couple months in terms of tenant traffic or sales or anything like that that might be a better indicator going forward? Rick Sokolov : I think we can say that April is off to a much better start. We obviously had Easter moving from March into April. March was better than February. February was better than January and that trend is continuing in to April and we certainly anticipate that we will have some catch up. Ki Bin - SunTrust: Okay and the second question. I am sure you guys get this all the time, but if you had to estimate, how many more outlets do you think in the U.S. that we absolutely could use? And how does that number compare to some of your, like in Europe where you are trying to expand? David Simon : Well, again, if you look at some of the general industry publications, there is a pipeline of 50 and I would just say I don't believe that that whole pipeline will be built. I do think last year, 2013 and 2014 was going to be an active year. So I think you will see five or six or so in the next two, three, four, five years. So if I had to guess I think you are going to see probably 20 or so added over the next three, four, five years. I don't think it's going to be quite as frenzied as everybody thinks. I think we have a really good handle, as you might imagine, on this industry. So that's my own personal view, but I don't control. Developers are always pushing the limit. Whether four or five or six that outlets get built, it doesn't impact our outlet business and what we do. And as you know we are looking to only build in major markets where there really is unquestionable demand for the premium outlet product. If it's a marginal market, we are just going to pass and we have passed on a number of sites. Rick, you can add anything? Rick Sokolov : The one thing that I would emphasize and David talked about in the context of Desert Hills, we are spending as much time and money expanding our existing great premium outlet as we are trying to build new ones. Desert Hills opens Thursday. We opened an expansion in Orlando. We opened an expansion at Seattle. We are under construction on Las Vegas North Downtown 147,000 feet. We are expanding Woodbury. We are expanding Chicago. And these are all among the best outlets in the United States. We are expanding Livermore and all of those expansions taken together are probably two or three new projects but they will be dramatically more productive, dramatically better returns and they have the benefit of enhancing what we already have. Ki Bin - SunTrust: Okay, and a similar question, but how about for Europe? Do you see that potential of it being just a lot bigger? David Simon : Yes, I think Europe, the right to build there is much more difficult but there is a pipeline that we have at MGE that we are going to pursue but it's lot tougher. It's a lot harder to get done. There is a lot more restrictions in terms of how outlets get viewed in Europe in terms of laws there. But if you do get the right to build, it's a terrific, terrific opportunity. So it will be more but I think it will be measured and we will have our share of that, but there is definitely part of what we want to do with MGE. It was in fact build some new centers in Europe. Ki Bin - SunTrust: Okay. Thank you guys. David Simon : Sure Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Craig Schmidt - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Hi, it's Craig Schmidt for Jeff Spector. I was just wondering if we could spend a little time talking about The Mills. It seems like it has the highest return on redevelopments. Its minimum rents are growing well and it's also seemed to have done the best in terms of sales per square foot productivity since 4Q 2009, in terms of its lift. I know you were doing a lot of things at a lot of different Mills, but what's meeting with the biggest success to sort of drive this? Rick Sokolov : Craig, it's Rick. I think that The Mills have been performing great and I think that some of it, hopefully a lot of it is attributable to us being able to broaden their appeal. What we have been able to do through our relationships is bring tenants that have been successful in premium outlet in The Mills operate off price concepts, and bring tenants into The Mills from the mall business to operate full price concepts. And that combination has been very compelling. So tenants like Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works are operating full price concepts and tenants like Michael Kors, Coach, Express are operating off price concepts. That combination has created, as David said, properties that are 1.5 to 2 million square feet doing hundreds of million of dollars of sales and providing unique franchise in each of the markets where they operate. So we have been very pleased with it and we are growing and we have got expansions underway at Sawgrass. We are working on redevelopments at Great Mall. We are working on expansion at Orange and there's a lot of growth runway to open that platform. Craig Schmidt - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Is there any potential for a ground-up development of a Mills project at this point? Rick Sokolov : I think that's going to be more difficult. Frankly there are not many markets left in the United States that can support a 2 million square feet ground up development that does $500 million and $700 million from day one. So I would not look for that. Craig Schmidt - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then the Yeoju expansion, the premium outlet. Is there any direction that you want to take the new tenants that you are bringing into that project? David Simon : It will continue to be the high-end tenants there. The existing center has a great tenant mix. So there will continue to be of all the American as well as European brands and the international companies. It is a international retail mix. There are some Korean retailers, but by and large its all the brands that you are familiar with. Craig Schmidt - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then hopefully this is the Steve Sterrett question. The pickup in other income, will we see that going forward? Will we have as active a land sales and/or the lease settlement? Or should we assume that that starts to resemble 2013? Steve Sterrett : Craig, Rick and David talked a lot about the lease settlement income of and I think we did have a fair bit of that activity in the first quarter. I wouldn't expect that level of activity to go through the rest of the year and land sales, as you know, are pretty lumpy but I certainly wouldn't expect that level of activity for the rest of the year. Craig Schmidt - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill: Hello, good morning. Just two questions here. First up, on the line of credit, you guys now have I think almost $7 billion if you include the accordions of capacity, which seems like an awful lot just given that if you guys wanted to do anything I would assume that you would have a line of bankers outside of Indy and 399 Park in less than an hour. Is more of this insurance? Like as you guys pay the facility fee, is more of this just the comfort of knowing that you have that? Or is there something else, like just preparing for the next credit crisis or something, just to know that, God forbid, you had to put on major mortgages or refinancings that you just had that available? Steve Sterrett : Well, Alex, it's Steve. I do think if you look at our debt maturity schedule, we do have $2 billion to $3 billion of debt maturing a year. We are a large company. We did have, people tend to forget, that we did have an instance, not all that long ago, in this country where the capital markets were pretty dysfunctional for an extended period of time. So we have been operating under a philosophy that we want $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity at all times. Call it insurance. Call it what you want. But I think that's prudent for a company our size. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill: Okay, and then just a second question is, what are the next steps or what else needs to be done before the Board can declare Washington Prime good to go? David Simon : Well, we just have to become effective with the SEC, which we are getting closer and closer. The Board has got to review all the final things and then we make an announcement. So its moving quickly and so it's just a process, essentially just becoming effective with the SEC and then Board approval and we are off to the races. Steve Sterrett : And you saw, Alex, we filed another amendment to the Form 10 yesterday, the amendment number 3. So we are, as David mentioned, getting down to the short strokes. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill: Okay, so this is just all the back and forth where they give you comments and hopefully that list of comments is getting smaller and smaller and then it's good? David Simon : Yes. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill: Okay, perfect. Steve Sterrett : If you are excited, you can read the 600 pages of total documents if you have nothing to do this weekend. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill: You know, my kids were saying, Daddy, we like you doing boring Daddy work. We don't like playing with you. So I will do that. Listen, thanks. David Simon : All right. No worries. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Daniel Busch of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors : Thank you. David, following the WP spin off of the smaller SPG malls and strip centers, will there be any other remaining malls in the portfolio that you would consider non-core and could be potential candidates for disposition? David Simon : Well, we will always going to be portfolio manage our asset. So the answer to that is sure. We have partners in some assets. Partners may want to sell. We may agree with them. So yes, sure. We are always going to portfolio manage our asset base. Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors : Okay, and it appears like there's a growing number of B and C malls coming to the market. Do you have a sense of what the demand is for that type of quality? Is it similar to the quality that WP is? David Simon : Well, I don't want to -- again, WP's malls are all sorts of the references from the analytic community. My view of WP's malls are there is the one overriding point is that they are smaller. They are just not big malls. I will let you decide whether that's a B-mall or C-mall, an A-mall. I don't think about it like that. I look at the cash flow what's the sustainability of the cash flow. Is that a market where you can grow the cash flow and the one thing that I will bring with is that they are smaller than our average mall. We think those assets because as we have gotten bigger over time and focused on the bigger assets, they tend to lose the day in and day out focus that they deserve. So with that preamble said, look there is a lot of capital in the real estate industry generally for all sorts of assets and money wants to be put to work in the top quality assets in redevelopment assets, in new development across the specter in hotels, retail, office et cetera and I think WP will be able to take advantage of whatever strategy ultimately they put together. But there are buyers for everything right now in any assets. I look at your NAV analysis and I can tell you, our partner is selling a mall and the cap rate is blowing me away in terms of how low it is. So there is a lot of capital for retail real estate in every bucket and to some extent there is product available and to some extent there is less product available but I expect a lot of trades to happen. Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors : Great, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Good morning or afternoon to you guys. I just want to go back to the releasing spreads. On a percentage basis, they have been improving for quite a few quarters here now in a row. I am just curious if you could break that down between sort of what's driving that? Is it more market rent increases? Or is it just the base of the malls that are on spaces that are closing? Is it maybe not growing or is going the other way? Rick Sokolov : Fundamentally, we just have a very good supply and demand dynamic. I would tell you that when you look at our spread calculations, they include almost eight million square feet of space. So it is less susceptible but specific project influences are much more representative of the overall trends throughout our business and we are just able to lease our product at higher rents because frankly I do believe our properties are taking market share and we are having a more desirable portfolio for the retailers to want to operate in. David Simon : But simply put, the expiring rent is just lower than the market rent. So there is a lot of reasons for that. But that's the simple answer. So if you look at our expiring rent schedule and you see where our market rents are, therein lies why we have the spread which therein lies why we have the ability to increase our cash flow year after year after year. Again you may notice I believe Q1 comp last year was 5%, something like that. Steve Sterrett : Yes. David Simon : So our 3.7% was off of a base of 5% that 3.7%, as I mentioned was hurt 90 basis points by extraordinary costs associated with the harsh winter. So you can normalize and do whatever you want with it but that's just how we would look at it and but its that simple. Now notice I didn't talk about retail sales. I talked about market rent. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Right, and that's what I am trying to get at. I guess maybe asking another way is, how (inaudible) market rents for your portfolio have gone up, say, over the last year or so as opposed to the spread, which --? David Simon : The good news is that its clearly gone up because you have seen the spread accelerate. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay, and maybe just another topic. I know its early days in your ownership there on the Oyster Bay development, but is there any update on how the development planning process is going over there? David Simon : It's very early days. So really nothing to add there other than we are excited about the opportunity. Our partners are excited about the opportunity. We very much look forward to working with the town to fine a win-win. So we think it's a great opportunity for us and it will be a high priority for us over the next year or so as we go through the process. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Yes, good afternoon. Going back to development and redevelopment yields, also noticed that you took up the yield on the outlet development to 10% from 9% last quarter. Just wondering what was driving that? Steve Sterrett : Two things. One, we been able to bring in our cost at a little below budget. Two, we have got a lot of demand and we been able to lease it at higher rents. Hence we got higher returns. David Simon : I would say it differently. I would say typically they sandbag us on the rent they charge but we let it get approved in any event. So it's all about setting expectations. Isn't it? Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Very much so. Were there any particular assets that kind of drove the average up? Or is this kind of happening across the entire development portfolio? David Simon : Pretty much across the board, we are seeing those trends. Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Okay, that's helpful, and then just staying on the outlet side, again there was some news out there a few days ago about Charlotte, North Carolina and the whole process of your development there, some pushback from local residents. Just kind of curious if you could opine on that? David Simon : It's opening on July 31 of this year and it's very well leased and we are in very good shape there. Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Okay, that is helpful, and then last one from me. This one to Steve. Credit provisioning levels also went up during the quarter. Just kind of curious what you are seeing from that perspective and what we should be modeling going forward. Steve Sterrett : Tayo, we talked a lot over the last few years about that expense being really low. I think what you saw this quarter is just a bit of a reversion to the mean. If you look in the context of $5 billion plus of consolidated revenues, I think we billed north of $7 billion a year to the tenants. Having $5 million of bad debt expense a quarter is still pretty de minimis, but I think that's probably more reflective of the run rate that we are going to see this year. Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Is that reflective, you are just updating your estimates or are you actually seeing more issues with the tenants themselves that's actually causing an actual increase in that number? David Simon : No, it's a bit of a combination of both. Our overall receivable level is still pretty well but interestingly enough our bad debt reserve is pretty much formulate driven and because you have had more tenant either announce store closings or in a couple of cases go into bankruptcy, we reserve a higher percentage of outstandings against the types of tenants and it generated a slightly higher bad debt expense this quarter. Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Great. Thank you very much. David Simon : Tayo, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Yang of Evercore. Please go ahead. Ben Yang - Evercore: Yes, hi, thanks. Maybe just building on the earlier lease spread question, I believe your spreads are based on openings and closings. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about spreads based on signed leases? Maybe what that trend has been? And also maybe how that compares with that 19.5% that you report in your supplemental. Steve Sterrett : Ben, you are right in that the spread is based on cash closing rent compared to cash opening rent, but because the population, as Rick mentioned, is still large, I mean it's eight million square feet at any one point in time. Looking at it on a signed basis relative to the actual opening isn't going to move the number up a lot, but I will echo what Rick said earlier that demand for space is good, deal quality continues to improve overall. We have been pleased to see the continued acceleration in the leasing spreads but looking at it from a signed basis to an actual opening basis isn't going to materially move the number. Ben Yang - Evercore: Okay, got it, that's helpful, and then also you talked a little bit about the lease termination income. Was that all Sony? Or were there other retailers in that mix? And maybe also, since it's a lot higher, can you also offer what your guidance is for the full year on that line item? David Simon : Yes, we don't like to do that but we have the Sony and then I mentioned about the other department store scenario. So that gives you the bulk of it more or less. Steve Sterrett : In commenting, Ben, on the volume of it, if you look back over our last several years, we have averaged $20 million to $25 million a year of lease settlement income. We just happen to have a larger chunk of that in the first quarter. Could it be more f significant in 2014 than it has been in n the last of couple years? Well, we are certainly off to start, and as David and Rick mentioned, because a couple of the lumpy things that have occurred in the first quarter, it could trend a little higher but it's certainly not going to trend at the same level we saw in the first quarter. David Simon : Yes, and again, I want to emphasize this is a -- Steve Sterrett : It's a good thing. David Simon : It's a good thing because again I don't lose the space. I just get at present value the lease obligation or very close to it. Then I have the ability to lease the space out. So it is not something, we have got to get the right values. We do lots of analysis, as you might imagine. We are very sophisticated on this front. Steve Sterrett : Or typically we don't execute it until we have got our replacement in place. David Simon : But this is not a bad thing at all. Ben Yang - Evercore: All right, I totally get it, it's not bad, but could it tick higher to that $20 million to $25 million that you have historically reported in the past? David Simon : It has a chance this year primarily because we did the one big deal with the department store which I would say is somewhat out of the ordinary. Ben Yang - Evercore: I mean, was that big deal, was that kind of baked into your earlier guidance? I am just kind of wondering if that was? David Simon : Yes. Ben Yang - Evercore: Okay, got it., David Simon : Absolutely. That's been in the works for two, three years. Ben Yang - Evercore: Okay, helpful, maybe final question. You talked a little bit about the other income in your consolidated. Why exactly did the other income in your joint venture also go higher? David Simon : Its part of the big lease settlement that I mentioned was in its of JV property. Steve Sterrett : Yes, the biggest drivers of the movement in that number though, Ben, is the nature of some of the income that flows through from McArthurGlen. A lot of it service related income. As you know, we own half of the economics of the development and management business. So that's the primary driver of that. Ben Yang - Evercore: Got it. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Yes, hi, thanks. Just following up on that real quick. So the $11 million is consolidated. What is the overall pro rata number for lease term this quarter? And when you talked about $20 million to $25 million normally, is that a consolidated number or is that the pro rata number? Steve Sterrett : The $20 million to $25 million would be the annual run rate, kind of on a pro rata basis, Michael. Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Got it, and what was the full pro rata in Q1 then? Steve Sterrett : It was high-teens. Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Got it, okay, and then last question. I guess historically you have talked about development spend having a bit at least about $1 billion a year for the next few years. As you look out from this standpoint, how many years out does that generally account for at this point? David Simon : Well, we have said through 2016, but it is not set in stone. Michael Mueller - JPMorgan: Got it, okay, great. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Please go ahead. Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group : Yes, thank you. Just one quick question, I guess for David and Rick. The so-called fast retailing tenants have been growing pretty dramatically in your properties for a number of years now and I think it shows up with Forever 21 being now a top 10 tenant and an average store size, just looking at the metrics and the setup of more than 10,000 square feet. Historically, of course, you have excluded stores of more than 10,000 square feet in the sales productivity number. I just wonder if, given the ambitious plans of cohorts like H&M and Uniqlo, whether you have given any consideration to perhaps including the fast retailing productivity and the reported productivity, given how important they seem to be and look like it's going to increase in importance. David Simon : Well, Jim, if you had listened to my -- Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group : I heard every word. David Simon : Yes, if you listened to my discussion on tenant sales, I would suggest to you, it's an interesting derivative, there's no correlation and the fact is there's no other industry that I know that's focused on retail sales. Therefore this is what's going on with your property. I before saying look at our cash flow and measure us on that basis. And I think somehow the industry is gotten off track here by being the most important metric. I look at the analyst report that came out that even though we beat consensus by $0.14 or something like that, we had unbelievable historical growth. Our comp NOI has grown year after year. It was up marginally in the great recession. The balance sheet is AAA. We are adding all this new development. The one constant dialogue I got was the tenant sales, right. So you want more of that. So I can read more of that. So somehow I am happy have this we discussed with you and other shareholders but somehow we are losing track that retailers come and go. This company was built based upon Kmart leases, okay? Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group : No, I understand all that. I just think the point is that fast retailing, as a format, does seem to be, in terms of its size, Forever 21 is an in-line tenant and I have no idea, by the way, what their productivity is. It's simply that they are now a top 10 tenant and H&M and Uniqlo have pretty ambitious expansion plans as well. And I was just, all I am doing is suggesting that the original reason for excluding tenants of over 10,000 square feet, I just wonder if it still applies when we think about that type of retailer. David Simon : I don't think as the mix has broadened in these centers, that metric is probably less and less important. What happens if we bring in service tenants or we take a department store down and put in an office building or an apartment complex. I think we are losing sight of, its real estate and it's about organic cash flow growth and it's not about what particular person is doing in a particular space because again we own the real estate, they don't perform we get it back and then the next question is what can we do with that real estate. So I will tell you what, I will put it in there if you talk about it on page 10 and not on page one. Okay. Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group : Well, I will just say for my note, by the way, I stressed if people want more space and are willing to pay more for it, what's the key driver. So not guilty as charged here, at least in that respect. And just one other question I had for you, and this maybe is a Rick question. The development activity number went up a little close to $300 million at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the year. Am I correct in assuming, Rick, that as far as the mall category, which is where it all took place, that that number didn't include your announcements on Pentagon and Phipps, number one? Number two, that it would be virtually all the Simon post-spin malls that we are talking about there? Rick Sokolov : Well, you shouldn't presume the latter because we are reporting everything in a combined basis so far. So in that regard, there is capital attributable to these post-spin assets we are doing things. Houston Galleria has started. We have also started on Florida Mall. So a number of new ones have come in to that mix but it is not a function of post-spin or pre-spin and it does not yet include Pentagon or Phipps. We just announced those will be starting construction this quarter. Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group : So the -- sorry. David Simon : Go ahead, Jim. Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group : Sorry, go ahead. Yes, I was just going to say post-spin, and I just want to make sure I understood the comments you made earlier regarding the level of development activity that we should expect from Simon post-spin. Obviously, it sounds like it's going to be the same kind of number as we have been thinking about historically for the company. Obviously the contribution should be relatively greater given that the post-spin company base is going to be a little bit smaller. But is there an opportunity in these malls that there could be an accelerated, an increased level of major expansion spending, given that where you are spending the money and the big money seems to be on the biggest, strongest assets where the demand is really very strong? Rick Sokolov : Certainly that is going to come about and where we got some of the other projects that we are working on that we hope to announce. We have already talked about connection to King of Prussia. So there are other nine bigger projects coming down the road including Copley that are going to certainly continue that level of spend in the post-spin side. Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group : Okay, very good. Thank you, guys. David Simon : And I was just going to add, Jim, just to make sure everyone that's still on the call, all of our numbers that we reported all include the WP assets, occupancy sales, comp NOI, all of the 8-K step is all including the WP all of that. Just to make sure everybody understands that. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks. David Simon : Okay, thank you. Before we conclude today's call for our stockholders that maybe on this call, our annual meeting is May 15 and hopefully you are seeing our proxy statement that we filed on April 10. Your vote is very important to us and the Board has unanimously recommended that stockholders vote for all of the proposals and I would ask you to please vote for all of the proposals. If you have not seen the proxy statement, then you can download a copy by visiting annualmeeting.simon.com. And thank you everyone for your time today. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation, and you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed. Liz Zale : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Simon Property Group Second Quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer, and we are also joined by Andy Juster, our current Treasurer and incoming CFO. Before we begin, just a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Please note that this call includes information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today\u2019s Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are also available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. Also due to the completion of the Washington Prime spin-off during the second quarter we are providing operating statistics for the prior year period to show performance on a comparable basis, excluding the Washington Prime properties which is in our supplemental 8-K. And now for our prepared remarks I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good morning. It was a very eventful and productive quarter. We completed the spin-off of Washington Prime Group. We re-launched our brand to create a whole new way to engage with consumers and most important we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. Results in the quarter were led by FFO of $2.16 per share exceeding the first call consensus estimate by $0.03 per share. Excluding the operating results from the WPG properties and the transaction costs related to that spend, FFO increased 12.8% year-over-year for the second quarter. As a point of interest if we exclude the transaction costs related to the spin, our FFO would have been approximately $2.26 for the quarter. And I would like to take a moment and put that number into perspective. I\u2019ll remind you that our second quarter 2010 FFO was $1.38 per share. So the quarterly profitability of Simon Property Group has increased by $0.88 per share, or $320 million quarter-over-quarter since then. Overall, business conditions remain favorable, driving the increases in our key operating metrics in our cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, occupancy ended up in malls, premium outlets and the mills. The Malls and Premium Outlets recorded increased leasing spreads to $11.06 per square foot. The mills recorded leasing spreads of $12.74 per square foot. And for those of you, who are interested, comparable property sales were up 90 basis points for the quarter and the movement from sales per square foot of $6.12 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $612 a year ago to $608 is solely related to bringing on several new projects totaling 2.16 million square feet. Comp NOI, of course, which I\u2019m more interested increased 5.6% in the second quarter and is up 5.5% year-to-date and over 95% of our domestic NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation. And as a reminder, our comp NOI in 2013 Q2 was over 5%. So that\u2019s 5.6% over 5%. These results are a testament to the strength of our assets, the desirability of our locations, and our ability to execute. So let\u2019s look a little forward, Charlotte Premium Outlets is opening on July 31, and is fully leased. Twin Cities Premium Outlets in Minneapolis will open August 14, and is fully leased. Construction continues on new Premium Outlet developments in Montreal and Vancouver, both high quality major markets, and Montreal will open in the fourth quarter. Formal groundbreaking at Gloucester Premium Outlets, a new 375,000 square foot center in Southern New Jersey that serves a greater Philadelphia area is scheduled for August 7. Other new outlet projects in our development pipeline are moving forward, but we are being very selective and focus on major markets and where there is clear demand from the retailers and manufacturers that matter.  : As a reminder, construction is ongoing in some of our most productive properties including Del Amo, Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, Houston Galleria, Stanford Shopping Center, and St. Johns Town Center. We also started construction on a significant mall redevelopment at Fashion Center at Pentagon City, which will add 50,000 square feet of small shop space including restaurants. And as you\u2019ve seen recently, we\u2019ve started the construction of the expansion of Chicago Premium Outlets, which will add 260,000 square feet, as well as a Shisui Premium Outlet in Japan that will add a 130,000 square feet. So put it altogether as we said, it\u2019s over $1 billion through 2016. And it\u2019s affecting some of the most productive assets, not only in this country but in the world. Now, capital markets, just briefly we did amend and extend our $4 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility with a June 2019 final maturity at LIBOR plus 80 basis points which is a tighter spread in our industry. We as planned, we retain $1 billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on the WP assets prior to the spin. We also announced a dividend of a $1.30 per share for this quarter, which is a 13% year-over-year increase. We will pay at least at SPG $5.15 per common share at SPG and we revised our guidance that we issued May 29, 2014 to a $1 \u2013 to $9.01 to $9.11 from a range of $8.96 to a $9.06 which raises both the top and bottom range by $0.05. Just to turn to management, Andy is here, will be our next CFO. Steve Yalof will join as CEO of our premium outlet business. Andy has been instrumental building the strength of our industry leading balance sheet, will maintain that focus. And Steve is a well respected retail real-estate executive who enhances our team and brings a unique perspective with his diverse retail background. I look forward to working closely with both of them. So, sum it up, great first-half of the year and we\u2019re absolutely focused on enhancing the value of our real estate which is being executed on daily, producing the results that we\u2019re hoping for. Questions? Liz Zale : Operator, (inaudible) for questions, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy representing Citi. Please proceed. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Good morning, everyone. You seem increasingly talking about potential densification of some of your assets in the possibility of adding non-retail components, if it makes sense. I think, partly you just talked about you also have a 230 unit residential project at Southdale Center ongoing. Probably, it\u2019s sort of fairly intuitive, but can you talk about your views on why it makes sense to add residential to a center like Southdale, what other traditional suburban regional malls of yours \u2013 you considering adding residential components? David Simon : Well. I mean, primarily because there\u2019s demand and we do like the interplay between high-quality residential with our high-quality retail offerings. And it\u2019s an opportunity to continue to add value to the company. So Southdale we\u2019ve had \u2013 and we\u2019ve had very good success in places like Firewheel and Domain, to name a few. We\u2019ve got both the hotel and residential going on at Phipps. : So it\u2019s not going to overwhelm us, but it\u2019s part of our strategy to continue to make our shopping centers the place to be, both from shopping, entertainment, leisure, eating, and then eventually living and spending time on, with respect to the hotel business. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: And then in terms of the larger projects that you have in the mall pipe with meaningful small shop expansion, David, you mentioned Del Amo, Pentagon City, Roosevelt Field, Stanford, Houston Galleria, as you think about adding additional small shop space to your better malls, what\u2019s the composition of new stores that you are putting in these expansions that you didn\u2019t sort of didn\u2019t previously have room for at the mall where you are seeing new demand, so how much is restaurants versus fast fashion versus luxury versus traditional mall retailers? David Simon : The simple answer really depends on where we are adding the space? What that centre lacks? What the demand is? But I would simply say, Christy, it\u2019s all of the above. In Pentagon, to take a simple example, in that case, it\u2019s really restaurants, because it\u2019s out in the exterior of the centre. If you\u2019ve been there, the porte cochere is kind of, really Humpty Dumpty, it\u2019s really terrible frankly. And, we think given its location and the ability to, if you\u2019ve been to Atlanta recently, you\u2019ve seen what we did with Lenox just opening up the centers creating a sense of, this is where you ought to enter, it\u2019s great for the restaurants and we\u2019ve seen a lot of synergy there. So in that case, it\u2019s \u2013 and there will be a little bit of fast fashion there as well, because of the customer base. But in Del Amo it\u2019s upgrading the mix and bringing in not the super-luxury but bring up the kind of the better retailers more aspirational brands, because we think that\u2019s what\u2019s missing. So, it depends a little bit on everything. In Galleria, the demand for luxury is immense, so having the abilities to take some of the existing retailers, moving towards the Saks existing store, which will be the new added small shop space will allow us to continue to upgrade, the true luxury players in kind of the Neiman Marcus wing. So, again, it\u2019s a little bit of everything and it really, really depends on where and what the demand is. Christy McElroy \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector, representing Bank of America. Please proceed. Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Now that Washington Prime has been spun out, I guess, David, can you talk to us a little bit more about your main goals, what you\u2019re going to be focusing on for the next 6 to 18 months, is it really the redevs and the branding effort? David Simon : Well, we do everything here, Jeff, and that\u2019s why our FFO increased, and again, we didn\u2019t do it by smoke and mirrors by high leverage. But our FFO increased from 2010 to 2014 just for the quarter $320 million, you don\u2019t do that by a little bit of this and a little bit of that, you do it by everything. So, I mean, at this point, we are going to continue to do everything. We are going to redevelop, we are going to release. We don\u2019t have industry comp leading numbers, quarter-after-after, year-after-year, we don\u2019t outperform over the last 12 years, over a decade, continuing beating First Call consensus estimates, year-after-year-after-year, not several years, but over a decade without being able to do just about everything. And so, we are going to continue to do just about everything. And I don\u2019t want to limit by redev or that, I mean, if you have a good idea, I will take advantage of it, tell me what I should do? But obviously I mentioned and I want to underline it, what we\u2019ve got going on at some of our big mama\u2019s, and I\u2019ve used that twice. Liz just frowned on me. But what we\u2019ve got going on at the field and the Galleria and Del Amo, I mean it\u2019s pretty, pretty big stuff. So that\u2019s hugely important, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve added some people to help us manage that, but we\u2019ll continue to do everything we can to drive this business forward. Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just one follow-up before Craig has a question. Is it too soon to talk about the \u2013 any response or feedback on the Simon branding effort? David Simon : Well, I can tell you that we\u2019ve been \u2013 the complements we have received have been fantastic. And I think from a retail point of view, the retailers that think of themselves as brands, it\u2019s been very, very positive. And at the end of the day, if you don\u2019t think of your company as a brand going forward, you\u2019re going to miss out on opportunities. So \u2013 but \u2013 this is a going to be \u2013 this not a \u2013 it\u2019s an evolution, we\u2019ll try to revolutionize parts of it, but it\u2019s going to continue to be something that we will reinforce with the consumer day-in and day-out, and our people in the field will reinforce it as well. But we are in early days on it, Jeff, but we are very excited about the prospects of continuing to upgrade the quality of our presentations and the quality of our service levels to our properties, and that\u2019s very important to today\u2019s world. Jeff Spector \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. I think Craig had one question. David Simon : Okay. Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I just wondered, it\u2019s high, if we could get to some comments on your involvement with digital and then possibly to live [ph] of the extent of your involvement in Holiday-14 [ph] if you\u2019re adding malls or markets? David Simon : Well, we are focused on making strategic VC-like investments in opportunities that we think will add value to our company in both from \u2013 helping our retailers, as well as helping our consumers. So as you know, we hired somebody, Skyler Fernandez, he has been here for three months, we\u2019ve made some investments. And Deliv, we will be bringing to Woodfield, it\u2019s \u2013 we are part of that group. We are not leading that group, which is fine. We don\u2019t have to lead everything we do, though I like leading everything we do, but sometimes we don\u2019t lead. And it\u2019s one of many things that we will continue to experiment with and we\u2019ll see where it goes. We\u2019ve got some expertise now. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we are looking around corners for opportunities, scholars, and covering a lot, we are in the deal flow. We\u2019re doing is smartly through we don\u2019t have 100 people run around, doing it, I think that way we are doing is smart, and like I said, we\u2019ve made some small investments, and we\u2019ll continue to make and then and I like the prospects of what we are trying to accomplish. Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim, representing SunTrust. Please proceed. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks. Could you just quickly talk about the Mills lease spreads? It seems like the $12.74 equals 47% of a percent change standpoint. Could you talk about how you are achieving that, and I guess it\u2019s not really driven by sales per square foot changes, so maybe a little more color on that. David Simon : Well, therein lies, again, the \u2013 first of all, I noticed in sales don\u2019t necessarily. There \u2013 as I mentioned you in the past, the fact that sales growth does not necessarily correlate to spread growth. So and the fact is, you can see that from the results that our mills portfolio posted. I don\u2019t know how else I can describe that to you, but other than producing the results that we did. So that that\u2019s how I would answer that question. We\u2019ve got an under-rented under market portfolio in the mills, we are upgrading the mix and we are charging more rent, simple as that. Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : It\u2019s all right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum representing UBS. Please proceed. Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Hey David, good morning. David Simon : Hey. Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Can you talk a little bit about the outlet sector versus the malls, just in terms of how do you \u2013 how would you describe the strength of demand you\u2019re seeing for outlets today versus the strength of the demand for malls, and maybe, how is that manifesting itself in terms of pricing-power for each of those segments? David Simon : I\u2019ll let Rick comment, but I\u2019d say there\u2019s no huge or material difference like \u2013 when we were coming out of the recession there clearly \u2013 there was more trepidation with respect to full price than there was the outlet. The outlets didn\u2019t see the big dip in demand. But I would say, today, it\u2019s pretty consistent. The only difference is that in the outlet sector you do have a number of the people that have not participated in it, wanting to. But, I would say the demand is not all that much different at all and it\u2019s \u2013 and the gap between the demand given that there\u2019s been no new supply and the regional mall business is basically on top of each other. Rick, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to it. Rick Sokolov : I just want to emphasize David\u2019s point in the outlets, there just happens to be a number of the mall tenants that frankly back when we got into this sector we started talking to them about the outlet as a desirable channel for their business. And now they\u2019re experiencing that and they\u2019re experiencing great result so a company like Express is now rapidly expanding. And the only other thing in the outlet is that the center sections for the most part are a little smaller and the spaces are smaller, so even with the same amount of demand the supply is more constrained and that gives you a little bit more pricing power. Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Second question, David, if we look at Washington Prime, I\u2019m curious, the stock is around $19, little under today, where did you think the stock was going to be when you decided to do the spend? David Simon : Well, look, I think the advice that we got was right in that range. And I\u2019m not here to talk about WP. WP will be providing that update in the next few weeks about what they\u2019re doing. But it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s right on. This is a \u2013 we\u2019ve been a public company for 20-some-odd-years. It takes time for companies to develop what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019m very pleased with WP from a director point of view and as a shareholder. It\u2019s very early days, it\u2019s been trading for what, six weeks, maybe, six weeks, so it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s right where we think it\u2019s going to be and I think they\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities. But they are much better equipped and frankly from a \u2013 just from a fiduciary point of view it\u2019s better that they do it than I do it. But, no great surprises on that whatsoever. Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. David Simon : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb representing Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Hey, how are you? David, two questions here, the first, we\u2019ll go back to the branding question. You\u2019re definitely a numbers guy and advertising tends to be sort of a softer metric as far as being able to gauge. How are you gauging the effectiveness on a dollars and cents basis? And have you \u2013 in order to fund this are you cutting back other advertising that you used to do or in total this represents an entirely new effort as far as, I mean, presumably you\u2019re advertising it for local level, so just sort of curious have you pulled back from that and focused more nationally or is this incremental too? David Simon : Well, look, I think that the \u2013 I mean, your comment about numbers reminds me \u2013 a lot of people said, I\u2019m not a real estate guy yet. I go back to this quarter-over-quarter, then somebody figured out how to grow the business $320 million. That\u2019s not for the year, that\u2019s just for the quarter-over-quarter. So, look, the fact is, we did reallocate spend, took it away from outdoor, put it more toward digital and TV, less from radio. I mean, we did that kind of stuff that we tweak every year where we\u2019re getting \u2013 we\u2019re getting that. So the answer \u2013 and there is a little bit of extra cost associated with the stuff that we\u2019ve done but it\u2019s going to be a test to measure business. But ultimately it\u2019s going to be managed within our typical budget every year that we do for marketing spend. But by having branded and in consistency across the portfolio you do get economies of scale, so we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of it. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill: So is there a way that you\u2019re measuring the spend or is it just something that you assume as long as you\u2019re getting positive feedback from tenants and customers? David Simon : I think \u2013 you certainly have that ability. I think the initial phase is more what\u2019s the feedback but as we get \u2013 as this progresses we are going to measure our results. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. And the second question is your releasing spreads have been accelerating. Can you just give some color whether either by mall or outlet, or if this is more new tenants coming in or this is just part \u2013 or if this is more driven by remerchandising tenants moving guys from the 50, down to moving new guys to the 50-yard one. David Simon : Well, you know I\u2019ll let Rick and Steve, if he wants to chime in. I would just point out to you that we are under-market rented that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to grow our comp NOI every quarter, where our occupancy cost for better or worse, if you want to focus on that, and you know how I feel on some of these numbers, is low, is very low, look at it and compare to our peer group. So it\u2019s low that allows us to increase our rents at the same time doing in a way that our retailers can continue to be profitable in our portfolio, which is important. So, that\u2019s \u2013 but it\u2019s continuing to upgrade and it\u2019s marking leases to market and that\u2019s what it is. Rick, you want to add anything? Rick Sokolov : The one thing I would again reemphasizing David has talked about, we keep talking about our re-development program. I don\u2019t think people appreciate how much better our properties are getting as places where retailers want to do business. We\u2019ve talked in the past how there are number of new entrants that want more square footage. It\u2019s a supply and demand business and as our properties are getting more desirable we have more demand, limited supply, we\u2019re able to drive rents. Steve Sterrett : Alex, this is Steve. I just add one comment, because you asked about the differences between new leases and releasing and interestingly enough we have the ability to parse the data and look at it and componentize it. And the spread is pretty much on top of each other, whether it\u2019s a new lease or a release. So, which I think echoes David\u2019s comment about the portfolio is just under market and whether it\u2019s the existing tenant and us reaching an agreement with them to stay in the space or whether it\u2019s remarketing it to another tenant. We\u2019re getting market rent for that space now. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. Listen, thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly representing Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning guys and congratulations to Andy and Steve. David, just building on an earlier question and looking longer\u2026 David Simon : One guy is not here, so until he posts you\u2019ll never know. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That\u2019s true. It\u2019s that, I\u2019m just curious \u2013 to build on an earlier question, looking longer than 18 months out, on top of honing the portfolio and maybe executing on the pipeline, do you think there\u2019s a role or a need for something larger to be done in real estate or perhaps even assisting brands of omni-channel retailing? David Simon : Maybe I\u2019m \u2013 that\u2019s I didn\u2019t \u2013 can you reinstate your question, I think I missed it, I didn\u2019t miss the \u2013 I missed it. Can you just, sorry, Jeff, can you? Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, no, problem at all. I was curious if on top of your, I guess the blocking and tackling on the portfolio, if you feel if there is a need or a role for Simon to do something larger in real estate or perhaps assisting brands of omni-channel retailing in the next few years. David Simon : Well, look, I think, we are always trying to assist the retailers, while at the same time grow our business, so there is this natural tension between the two of us. But yes, I think, we\u2019ve got to continue to upgrade the portfolio and drive traffic, if that\u2019s your question, yes. So, yes, we have a \u2013 we certainly have a responsibility to retailers to make our environments as productive and as exciting as possible. That\u2019s the biggest focus we have. Rick, I think, we feel like we have that obligation, we have it to the consumer too. So, I mean, that\u2019s what \u2013 I mean, the amount that we\u2019ve done within the portfolio just upgrading little stuff from restrooms to play areas to seating areas to exterior improvements to doing the \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve done a hell of a lot over the last several years. Right \u2013 we were able to shutdown when the world was ending and start back up, we were able to shutdown better than anybody else. We were able to startup better than anybody else. And all of that\u2019s proven, because all of that\u2019s in our numbers. So, we had \u2013 we \u2013 forget \u2013 I hate losing WP because it\u2019s \u2013 now I got \u2013 I lost $1 dollar FFO. But we would have been a $10, roughly, right? You are going to do the calculation \u2013 excuse me, if I\u2019m rounding here and there. But \u2013 so everybody is going to do the calculation, what does that mean, what does mean? But we were going to be $10 per share, $6 in dividends, where were we in 2006 and 2007? Where was everybody else? So those are big numbers. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Well, I guess, that\u2019s the \u2013 I guess the root of my question is I think you\u2019ve certainly done well in strengthening the balance sheet, and you spun off Washington Prime and there is a big pipeline today. David Simon : Yes. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  And I guess I\u2019m wondering if, going forward, you see more of your capital allocation going to things outside of malls and outlets and maybe into other areas. David Simon : No, we are going to always stick to retail real estate. And we will densify here and there. But and we think we can do that appropriately not get over our skis, but no, we are going to always be a retail real estate company, that won\u2019t change. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  And then I guess for Rick, just a few questions, did you guys see much of a sales impact in outlets in Japan, just because they did a big increase in their VAT tax in the second quarter, did you see anything there? David Simon : Well, let me \u2013 that really should go here as opposed to Rick\u2026 Rick Sokolov : I don\u2019t leave the domestic chores. David Simon : But the fact of matter is, actually I\u2019m glad you brought that up, because the answer is no, believe it or not. There was a little bit of a spike ahead of that and our Japanese partner is actually coming at \u2013 the weather here is bad, so I assume they\u2019ll still get in \u2013 but they are actually coming here for the next couple of days. But it\u2019s actually surprisingly held its own, I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but the answer \u2013 the simple answer is no. it\u2019s actually done very, very well even with the increase in that. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  And I think this one is for Rick, because he and I were exchanging phone calls. Could you talk about the replacement you have lined up for the Nordstrom space at Florida Mall, and a maybe a little bit why Nordstrom opted to leave that market, and does that foreshadow anything for that property? Richard Sokolov : Well, the property is frankly growing extraordinarily well. And in fact, right now we are in the process of adding a new flagship Zara, American girl. We are adding a completely new food hall with other restaurants. And I\u2019ll let Nordstrom\u2019s statement speak for itself, but we are very excited about our replacement strategy for that box. And, in fact, there will probably be announcements forthcoming in the very near future that will show you what we have in mind there and we believe it\u2019s going to be a substantially positive addition to the property. David Simon : Yes, it\u2019s absolutely, unequivocally not a reflection of the mall at all. So let me make that clear, the mall does a $1000 a foot\u2026 Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Yes. David Simon : And it\u2019s gown its NOI every year and so it\u2019s a great mall, no issues. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Thanks, guys. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Good morning, out there. David Simon : Good morning. Stephen Sterrett : Good morning. Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So First a question on clip here. I know that you do not include it in your core same-store numbers. But we noticed a large drop in your share of NOI from clip here, NOI, page 21 of the 2Q sup, down to $53 million from, it looks like $67 million last quarter. Can you perhaps give us a bit of color on what caused such a big drop, where there one-timers in either number? David Simon : Yes, Q-over-Q there were one-timers last year. Stephen Sterrett : They also\u2026 Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley : I\u2019m speaking to, sorry, to first sequentially last quarter. David Simon : Okay. They \u2013 part of that is dilution that that occurred with their sales. They sold Carrefour assets. Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. David Simon : Okay. Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Anything else there, or it was just\u2026 David Simon : They\u2019ve reported their numbers, so no, the answer is no. I mean, they\u2026 Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. David Simon : No, it\u2019s there and they are in very good shape. Our investment, we are plus 900\u2026 Stephen Sterrett : Almost $1 billion. David Simon : Almost $1 billion of 52%. As Adam Sandler would say, not too shabby. So, and they are doing a good job and I have yet to learn one word in French, which is quite pleasing to me. Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks for that. One more if I may. Understanding your views, David, on sales per square foot, I was just curious though on your thoughts on\u2026 David Simon : Let me just stop there. What \u2013 my \u2013 I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the \u2013 again, I\u2019m not trying to tell you that it\u2019s not unimportant. Question is whether we should obsess over it or not. And what I \u2013 and what I\u2019m trying to explain to the market, I obsess over my revenues. I obsess over my comp NOI. I don\u2019t obsess over what the retailers do in my properties unless I\u2019m doing a bad job than I obsess over it. So what happens in our industry is, retailers, they get hot, they have great sales, they don\u2019t \u2013 it changes, we\u2019ve got to develop the right mix, sometimes that\u2019s our fault, sometimes it\u2019s the retailers fault. The important thing is where we \u2013 where is our leases vis-\u00e0-vis market? What\u2019s the demand, and can we increase our cash flow? That\u2019s what I obsess over. So I\u2019d never had a headline saying sales are up when they are my tenant sales, because I \u2013 my headline is what are my sales up? And, in fact, I think this quarter up 9%, right, roughly looking at my team, they are shaking their head. So that\u2019s what I obsess over, that\u2019s the difference that I\u2019m trying to communicate. And as you know, other retail reach in this \u2013 in the universe of 30 of us, more than half of them don\u2019t even report what their tenant sales are. So, we are just trying to say, yes, I hear you, it\u2019s interesting, but it\u2019s not what\u2019s going to drive our ability to increase our cash flow, because remember, we can take the space back. Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley : Got you, got you, and I understand. I appreciate your views and then again, we understand why you think, what you think. But I\u2019m just curious on your thoughts on potentially creating a new category of sales productivity reporting to perhaps capture the larger in-line tenants, the H&M, the Uniqlo, that pay you rent more like in-line tenants but who\u2019s results are not included are not included in your reported core numbers, especially given how well they\u2019ve been fairing lately. David Simon : Well, look, we track total sales and I think year-to-date we include everything that we don\u2019t get, everybody doesn\u2019t report. We have the department stores and some don\u2019t and some do. Rick, what\u2019s our total numbers up? Rick Sokolov : It\u2019s almost 3.5%. David Simon : 3.5%, so, that\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re right, if \u2013 now, I\u2019m not going to do that on a per foot basis because it includes department stores but it does show you what\u2019s going on with market share of our property. So they\u2019re up \u2013 the total sales that we get reported are up 3.3%. Now is that a number that we should report? I don\u2019t know. When the strip center guys do it, call me and I\u2019ll do it, okay? Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley : Fair enough. Thank you. David Simon : Yeah, no worries. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Tayo Okusanya representing Jefferies. Please proceed. Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Yes, good morning, everyone. Just along the lines of just the retailer outlook, I was wondering, if you could just get some sense from you, how you\u2019re feeling about things like mall traffic and just the kind of general sense of what the mall feels like today and also in July? David Simon : Well, look, the fact is the consumer generally is still very cautious and we see that across the board. There is no denying that, from \u2013 as you know, a number of retailers, both low and medium and even high-end, are all seeing somewhat of a cautious consumer. And that\u2019s certainly is affecting retail sales in our properties. So that continues to be the case. We have our work cut out for us, with respect to that issue. We think it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shift issue going from. We\u2019ve done a lot of research here. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shift from the \u2013 to online from physical. It\u2019s really more of an indicator that the consumer right now is pretty cautious. So \u2013 and I think a lot of that is just all the macro stuff that\u2019s out there. We\u2019ve seen it before. We certainly have some retailers that have their issues which will put \u2013 puts focus on us to release their space. But again, I mean, those things ebb and flow, but we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us with regard to just kind of a consumer that\u2019s cautious right now. Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : So would you have it to guess that mall traffic is down slightly or down low double-digit or anything of that sort? David Simon : Well, it\u2019s not down double-digits, okay. I don\u2019t know where you get that data either. Now, it\u2019s not \u2013 I would say mall traffic is generally flat, the summer months are not big until late July and August because they\u2019re back to school. June is not an important month. Early part of July is not. So we\u2019ll see what happens. Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : All right, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more from me on the outlet side of the business, during ICSC there was a general commentary coming out of the company about some additional developments that could be done in 2015, 2016, like half-a-dozen potential locations that were mentioned. Just wondering if there was any update on that? David Simon : Yeah, we do it, you mean from our company? Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Yes, correct. David Simon : Yeah, yeah, we do intend to \u2013 as you know, as I mentioned in remarks we\u2019re starting Gloucester which is August 7, okay. That groundbreaking that open, basically a year from August, and we do have one other of that we will hope to start this year and then we still have three or four that are in the pipe for next year. So, yeah, nothing has really changed on that and again I won\u2019t bore the callers on my comments but we\u2019re being very selective in where we want to go and where demand is. And we are \u2013 let\u2019s \u2013 not that we\u2019re always going to bet a thousand, meaning we may pass up an opportunity that turns out good or may build one that\u2019s not great, but those \u2013 the two options that can happen. But generally, I would say we\u2019re experts at understanding where the manufacturers and where the retailers that matter want to build the next outlet, okay. Doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to bet a thousand but it\u2019s going to be pretty damn close. Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Sounds good to me. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hey, guys. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger, but clients just keep asking about sales, so I have to shoot a couple in. You mentioned earlier that the re-devs were impacting sales, which kind of makes sense because you\u2019re going to have lower sales as it\u2019s going on. Do you have any idea of what the quantity of that was? David Simon : Well, we go property by property but the fact that matter is, look, sales were \u2013 I will just say this, we added more space so when you look at the $612 to $608 that\u2019s the primary issue there. And also we added some centers that are not quite up to the core average yet. And, and but that, that\u2019s nothing new and out of the ordinary. It does take time for centers to, to develop their trade area and everything else. So, in the movement, because I don\u2019t want to call it the decrease because it really didn\u2019t decrease, the movement from $612 to $608 was really a function of adding additional space. And as I mentioned to you the comp sales were actually up 90 basis points which would ignore that impact. We give you total sales, but the comp sales were up 90 basis points and the total sales, just volume-wise not on a per square foot basis was up 3.3%, and that as much as I really want to talk about sales. Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs : I know and I \u2013 and by the way nobody is going to report 5.6% NOI growth of amongst your peer group. David Simon : Nobody, right? Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs : But this is what I do for a living so the 90 was actually trailing 12 months, not just the second quarter? David Simon : It was Q-over-Q. Rick Sokolov : Yeah, second quarter. Liz Zale : Second quarter. Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Second quarter over second quarter true comp, okay. And then let me ask you a sales question that actually does matter. David Simon : Yes. Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs : I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s part of the Washington Prime spend. You spent some time thinking about what the growth could be on a multi-year basis because let\u2019s face it, if sales really are flat or they are even negative for three years or five years, that actually does matter. And maybe if you could share a multi-year view I think it would be really helpful to the market. David Simon : Well, I mean, you see where our \u2013 I mean, I guess, the simple is just look at where our rent \u2013 our expiring rents are versus what we\u2019re bringing in new rents at today\u2019s sales level and if your \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019re focused on you can see that embedded growth is pretty significant. Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Well, that\u2019s not \u2013 that easy, right, just even if sales stays flat you can say where it\u2019s going to go. But do you have any thought of where sales are going to go. Any thoughts on looking at the last 12 months, not being representative of what were you really think that the tenants can drive their sales going forward in the next two or three years. David Simon : Look, I\u2019m not going to give you a number, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. But, I do think that the consumer has been cautious and for all sorts of reasons. The sense on the macro side is that \u2013 and part of that was a move toward durable stuff, but the fact that matter is, I do think there is a law here and I don\u2019t view it as a long term role. I do think, the economy sounds, feels like it\u2019s getting better and with that the consumer will move forward. But as I said, you have \u2013 the GDP of last quarter it was down 3%. I had nothing to do with that. I did my fair share, I built, I redeveloped, I hired people, I gave raises, I did everything I can to juice the economy, so don\u2019t look at me. Okay? Now we\u2019ll see where we feel good about our business. Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks, sir. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan representing MLV, please proceed. Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.: Hi, good morning. David Simon : How you\u2019re doing? Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.: Good, thanks. On occupancy, so you \u2013 I mean, you are getting up to pretty high numbers already. And based on your typical seasonality and another 100 basis points higher at year-end or more, I mean, do you think you are at the frictional maximum? I mean, it\u2019s a little harder for you guys because the outlets have always run higher to comp you against the rest of the peer group. But if you just think of the malls, is this where we\u2019ll end this year? I mean, do you think there\u2019s much more upside? Is it good to push for that upside or to leave some kind of frictional wiggle room? David Simon : Well, look, I\u2019m always of the view, make the deal, lease the space. But look, I think Paul at the end of the day there\u2019s going to be a little volatility in through it, because there are some \u2013 we have a little bit more bankruptcies this year than we did the last couple. So, we\u2019re \u2013 when you get the space back you don\u2019t have it immediately leased, it takes time. So there\u2019s going to be some of that volatility, but I think we\u2019ll maintain that kind of level of occupancy, give or take a little bit here and there. Rick Sokolov : The only other point I would make Paul is that we spend a great deal of time asset managing our space to get the highest yield we can out of that space in terms of rent and sales production. So much of our discussions with our tenants are getting them right-sized which in a lot of instances is decreasing the amount of space they\u2019re in so we can create additional rooms out of the same square footage which drives our sales and drives our rent. So there is a lot of levers still left that we can pull to generate productivity even at these higher occupancy rates. Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so my other question just on development. You got about $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, your share in your shop listed for activity that\u2019s under construction. And so that\u2019s basically over the next two years, I guess. And what should we think in terms of annual completions based on kind of what\u2019s in your pipeline for starts over the next 12 months? I mean, is that number going to stay about the same? Do you have some big projects that are going to come in? David Simon : Yeah, I mean, I think the best way to do it is we think on average we\u2019re going to as we said, spend about a $1 billion plus a year so. It will spike in that but if you\u2019d \u2013 and that\u2019s just more or less domestic. But we\u2019ve got \u2013 that might spike when we put Copley in and couple of others. So we\u2019re going to \u2013 there is lumpiness to it, because some of the stuff that we\u2019re finally doing is big stuff, the fields of the world [ph], Del Amo, so you\u2019re going to have some spiky. But on average, when you look back on 2016, 2017 it\u2019s going to be a $1.2 billion or so per average, more or less. Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.: And do you think that 8% mall redevelopment yield is going to be consistent even when you add some of those kind of bigger projects? David Simon : Yeah, look, the answer is yes, because we also have new development in there that will be at higher yields than that, so when you put it altogether it\u2019s a pretty good number that we feel good about. Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks. David Simon : No worries. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller representing JPMorgan. Please proceed. Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan: Yeah, hi, following up on the last question, if you go out past 2016 and think about the next three years, five years or so, does it seem like you can maintain that roughly $1 billion a year spend based on what you think is in the shadow pipeline at this point? David Simon : It\u2019s so hard to really tell you one way or another. I don\u2019t know, mean, the simple answer is I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think it certainly could extend a couple of years. But we have a very disciplined philosophy about adding because \u2013 an over improvement of center, because at the end of the day you know what \u2013 you know if I go back to this $320 million, you know what drives our earnings is that we think about return on equity better than lot of folks and that\u2019s what drives the business. So if you over improve stuff and you don\u2019t get the right return on equity you kind of get \u2013 you\u2019ve kind of done it and that\u2019s great and the architects can pat themselves on the back, but the question is where is the cash flow. So, I don\u2019t know, I mean I think we\u2019re so focused on the handful of big things that we have that\u2019s the key. But Copley is four, five \u2013 unfortunately because I\u2019d rather have it much quicker but that\u2019s a four or five year project. So I think the simple answer is that, yeah, that $1 billion to $1.2 billion stretches from 2016 goes to 2017 and 2018 and then after that it\u2019s hard to really tell you one way or another. Rick Sokolov : The only thing I would add to this, are we looking for other opportunities within the portfolio? Absolutely. Do we have a number of things that we hopefully believe we can do to create incremental opportunities? We do, but it\u2019s going to be approached with the same discipline and the same rigor of analysis, so we don\u2019t do something that\u2019s stupid. David Simon : Yeah, and we\u2019re actually not in the \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of new development, not outlets that we\u2019re thinking about. We\u2019re close to one deal and Liz brought Oyster Bay, so we\u2019ve got two deals, thank you. Two deals that are out there to do new development that will not be outlets that aren\u2019t in. So, economy gets better, stronger, maybe there is a little bit more new development going on. So, it\u2019s a tough question to really give you any comfort and other than \u2013 the philosophy, return on equity is what\u2019s really going to drive us. So if we \u2013 we won\u2019t waiver from that. Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan: Got it. Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Roane representing Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed. Jeremy Roane \u2013 Hilliard Lyons : Good morning and thank you for taking our question. And we noticed that tenant reimbursements as a percentage of operating expenses were higher than in the previous quarters before the spin-off of Washington Prime. Is the current quarter a good run rate for tenant reimbursements going forward? And also what led to the increase in home and regional office costs? Steve Sterrett : Jeremy, this is Steve Sterrett. Couple of things, because the income statement has been reclassified and the Washington Prime assets are all in, discontinued operations, I do think the P&L for the quarter reflects a good run rate for the existing Simon portfolio. So I would say that\u2019s fine. The one caveat, David mentioned it earlier, is we did spend incremental dollar in the second quarter related to the role out of our branding campaign and that lumpiness won\u2019t occur quite the same way in the future. David Simon : Home and \u2013 I\u2019ll just \u2013 yeah, you want to answer that? Steve Sterrett : Yeah, I\u2019ll go ahead, the home office and regional costs, the variance both year-over-year and sequentially with the first quarter is all one-time stuff. Some of it is related to the Washington Prime transaction, where we vested some equity and recorded the costs for people who are now Washington Prime employees. Some of it was incentive compensation, some bonuses that were paid for mid-level people here in the organization who worked very hard on the Washington Prime transaction. And\u2026 David Simon : No, but no, executive... Steve Sterrett : No, and that\u2019s why I used the term mid-level. And then some of it is retirement related costs relative to the change in leadership at the premium outlet group that David mentioned. Jeremy Roane \u2013 Hilliard Lyons : Excellent, thank you very much. David Simon : Sure, thank you. Steve Sterrett : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang representing Evercore. Please proceed. Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners : Thanks. Sorry, if I missed this, but did you update your same store NOI guidance excluding Washington Prime? I\u2019m just curious if you think growth can accelerate during the second-half of the year. Richard Sokolov : Ben, the one thing that we did back when we announced Washington Prime, we told you that it would accelerate our same-store NOI by 30 bps, but that\u2019s the extent of the update, we have not given a forecast for comp NOI for the rest of the year. Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners : But if your prior guidance was 4% and now it\u2019s 4.3%, should we assume that growth will decelerate during the second half of 2014? Richard Sokolov : I wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that, no, because we are a little bit ahead of our plan year-to-date. Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners : Okay, got it. And then maybe switching gears, can you talk about why you guys didn\u2019t consolidate your ownership of St. John\u2019s Town Center when your partner was looking to sell? And if it was price which I believe it was a 4% cap rate, was there an opportunity or consideration to maybe selling your stake along with your partner for that asset? David Simon : Well, the answer is primarily the reason we didn\u2019t buy was primarily price, just to cut to the chase, even though we think it\u2019s a great asset long-term. Why would we sell? I mean, it\u2019s a great asset. We built it. We leased it. We managed it. We are adding Nordstrom. We don\u2019t need the capital, that\u2019s the business we\u2019re in, in owning real estate. So why would I sell a mall that\u2019s that \u2013 we are the managing partner. We run it day-to-day. We had a partner in it, so it was no harm, no foul. I didn\u2019t say any real, we don\u2019t need the capital and see any reason to sell it. Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners : Got it. That makes sense. If it was a 4% cap rate for what I believe is a 700 per square foot mall, is that a good comp for trophy assets, or I believe there is some near-term lease roles that could be potentially pushing that cap rate lower. And if that is the good comp, do you think that have any, do you have any thoughts on what that means for the value of your stock? David Simon : Well, let me just \u2013 you\u2019ve put a lot in there. I don\u2019t want to tell you what, I\u2019m not going to sit here and say to you that what the cap rate was. We don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s a private transaction. So it is what it is. Reason we didn\u2019t buy it, we owned it, we controlled it, we didn\u2019t see that, with all the capital that we are putting back in a portfolio, it wasn\u2019t really \u2013 it wasn\u2019t in \u2013 we didn\u2019t see that, the real need to do it from our standpoint. From a going forward, I mean, look, if you look at the value in the private markets and what\u2019s being paid and look at where our stock is trading. And I think you could certainly make the argument that the private market is certainly more expensive than public stocks. And assuming we don\u2019t decrete from value, but create value, you ought to get a little, maybe $0.20 a share for that. So but Ben, I mean, I would say to you clearly that the private market value clearly is more expensive than the public market value, when you put it altogether. But that ebbs and flows. Ben Yang \u2013 Evercore Partners : Got it, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore, representing RBC Marking. Please proceed. Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hey, guys, good morning. On occupancy costs, you guys give that in the supplemental at 11.6%. But of course, that\u2019s a mix of existing leases and new leases. And I\u2019m curious what would that number be, you think for new and renewal leases you put in place today? Richard Sokolov : It\u2019s going to, look, our leasing trend right now is continuing unabated. And David pointed out, if you look, we are signing new leases at $66. We\u2019ve got expiring leases at $41. It\u2019s going to be around, you are talking about the spread? Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Yes. I\u2019m thinking, Rick, the actual occupancy costs numbers. So that new rent that you are getting at $60 plus as a percent of sales. Richard Sokolov : Overall, for the body of work we are doing, that is going to basically be right around the same number and maybe moving up a touch based on the\u2026 David Simon : I think what Rich is asking is, when we look at new deals, what is our occupancy cost? I would say it\u2019s probably in the 14% to 15% range. And that range, but again, it\u2019s all over the board. But again, if you look at our peer group, we\u2019ve got very low occupancy cost and the ability to drive that, we will continue to drive our comp NOI in a stable economy. Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Right. I got you, David. Yes, that\u2019s a significant number. I appreciate that. Then the other thing is, you didn\u2019t spend a lot of time on your European investments on the call here. David Simon : Yes, we did that deliberately, not that we don\u2019t love, okay, and not that they are not doing well. We are just \u2013 we are trying to make our remarks shorter and shorter, so\u2026 Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : No, I hear you, I hear you. I\u2019m curious how you see that that actually going at this point, if there is a \u2013 how the relationship, I guess is progressing. And then also I\u2019m a little curious, is there anything coming back this way, so are you finding new tenants, are you finding any changes in organizational thoughts, anything like that that comes in the other direction? David Simon : Well, I mean, just to name two great retailers that are from Europe coming here, Primark and Topshop. And just to name, forget H&M and Zara, who have been here. But those relationships are certainly enhanced by our presence in internationally. But Rich, I would say simply this. We are betting 1,000 in Europe and in international. So everything, and that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s Kl\u00e9pierre is \u2013 it\u2019s great. The McArthurGlen deal is going to be very good. We think we got in at a very good value and there is growth opportunities. And the outlets business in Malaysia, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Canada, thank you, Steve, is good, it\u2019s all good. So we just figured, I mean, we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re trying to shorter the presentation up, and Liz wrote it, and I took it out. Don\u2019t read anything into it, okay. Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : I got you. On that, on Europe, is it sort of steady as we go at this point, you think, or will there be possibly new announcements coming out of the European venture? David Simon : I\u2019m open to any ideas anybody has, okay. No, but I, look, I think McArthurGlen\u2019s development pipeline is very active, but as you know that take time. And Kl\u00e9pierre, where we get strategic guidance and all that stuff, but they\u2019ve got a good pipeline to in terms of extensions and the like. So Japan we\u2019ve got, yes, so we are going to continue to build on those businesses. Is there going to be anything earth shattering? It depends what you consider earth shattering. Richard Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : All right, I got you, great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim, representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Chris for Dan. Occupancy in 1Q and 2Q has been among the highest in 10 last years for those quarters. And understanding that you have achieved strong rent growth in those quarters, just wondering though that given those occupancy rates is so much higher than typical for those quarters, is that a situation where you may have pushed even harder on those rents, or do you feel that you have struck a pretty good balance between occupancy and rental rate growth? David Simon : Well, I think we are, look, it\u2019s an art, not a science. I think we are pretty good at it. And I think historically, philosophically, we\u2019ve always here on making a deal. So, we are not as \u2013 I\u2019m sure people complain on the other side sometimes. But so I think we are always trying to lease our properties up. I do think, if you are looking historically, you\u2019ve probably got a big compositional change in the portfolio, I mean, depending on how far out you are looking, that\u2019s occurred over the last decade. So that\u2019s what maybe causing that to some extent. So, I would \u2013 that\u2019s probably the biggest issue. And you know it\u2019s interesting in the Q1 we used to have a lot of fallout every holiday season because of \u2013 let\u2019s talk 10 years ago. That is become less and less of a typical event. So, it may be seen a little bit of that on the margin. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s really helpful. Yeah, that\u2019s true. And back 10 years just looking at those and I think, yeah, there\u2019s definitely some competition changes. David Simon : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Second, you mentioned before that you\u2019ll continue to prune the portfolio as you\u2019ve always done, even after the spin-off. But with the free cash flow funding most of the development and the redevelopment pipeline, do you see much in the way of dispositions for the remainder of 2014? And I guess just generally do you have the regional mall portfolio kind of where you wanted after the spin-off or is there some \u2013 still work to do there? David Simon : I would say there is always going to be assets that we\u2019re going to prune and sell. Frankly, it hasn\u2019t been a huge focus given the spin-off. We spent most of our effort of any free time on that. So I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll think about for 2014, 2015. I\u2019m still depressed that I lost $1 of FFO, so I got to get over that. I hate losing cash flow like that. So, I\u2019ve got to come to grips with that, but yeah, we\u2019ll continue to sell, but probably nothing that\u2019s \u2013 the rest of this year of any material nature. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks, David. David Simon : Yes, no worries. Operator : Your next question comes as a follow-up from the line Christy McElroy representing Citi. Please proceed. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hey, It\u2019s Michael Bilerman. I just had a couple questions. The first is for Sterrett. And I guess - I don\u2019t know if Andy is in the room. But as I think about the balance sheet, which is in unbelievable shape. One thing that we haven\u2019t talked about is that you have about $7.5 billion of debt coming due within the next 2.5 years at like 5.5%, so 30% of your debt, a big chunk of that being unsecured bonds, a bunch of that secured debt on balance sheet, and a bunch in the JVs. I guess how aggressive can you be to pull any of that forward without paying huge charges or make holes to bring that cash flow because, David, I know you love cash flow, to bring that cash flow forward? Steve Sterrett : Did your liability management people prompt you to ask that question? Are you allowed to talk to them? Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: There\u2019s a big Chinese wall. Steve Sterrett : Okay. Just checking. Well, Michael, I mean, it\u2019s fair and I do think if you look at the expiration, the debt maturity schedule, one of the things you see is that the next couple of years out, we\u2019ve got the opportunity to continue to roll down rates. It is something that we look out on a regular basis. But listen, it\u2019s essentially trading dollars, because there are make holes or yield maintenances in virtually every debt instrument that we have. So, but there are other ways that you can potentially hedge your bets a bit, whether it\u2019s going out and doing treasury locks or whatever. So we do look at it. And we are as aggressive as we can be. Andy would tell you that we pay every debt instruments that is open to par date and we\u2019re managing that as aggressive as we can. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Understanding that there is a curve aspect of this, but what is your sort of contemplate as you think about the next 2.5 years in this debt rolling? Where you sort of want to move that in your schedule? Because obviously it\u2019s like 100 basis points is over $0.20 a share, right? And clearly where you are on a 10-year basis today, you would be at probably 3% to 3.3%. So how should we think about how you want to roll that debt? Are you going to \u2013 what is that average term, 5 years, 7, 10, 15\u2026? I\u2019m just trying to get a\u2026 David Simon : The simple answer to it will be \u2013 it will be across the spectrum. Rick Sokolov : But I would also say Michael, one of the things that we focus on a lot is the asset liability match and ours is primarily a 10-year lease business. So 10-year debt is primarily the sweet-spot of where we\u2019re going to do most of our financing. But I\u2019d also tell you, go back and look at our weighted average cost-to-debt over the last four years, it\u2019s come down 15 basis points, 20 basis points a year. That opportunity is certainly still out there for the next couple of years, the markets are in really good shape right now. And I would also tell you that one of the reasons that you\u2019re hesitant to do a large liability management trade is that the forward curve tends to overestimate where rates end up about 90% of the time. And David mentioned in his remarks the fragility of the consumer in the economy. It\u2019s hard to envision a scenario in the near-term where rates are going to run crazy, because I don\u2019t think the economy would continue to grow in a substantial rising credit environment. David Simon : I \u2013 Michael and I will just say this. One of the things that\u2019s interesting, our floating-rate debt percentage is absolutely well below our peer group. It is 7%, if that, 5%, somewhere in that range. So we\u2019re really not juicing our FFO by playing the floating-rate debt game. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Well, your debt also is materially lower as a percentage of your enterprise value. So it\u2019s even a lower percentage. And you are sitting on $2 billion of cash. David Simon : Yes. So what do you want me to do? Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: And you\u2019ve got $1 billion of free cash flow a year. So what are you going to do? David Simon : I don\u2019t know. Richard Sokolov : I don\u2019t know. David Simon : Come talk to me, I\u2019m lonely. Richard Sokolov : We saw that Apple has still got $120 billion of cash, so we\u2019ve some \u2013 we\u2019ve got ways to go. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: So question, David, on Kl\u00e9pierre, BNP had to pay the U.S. government $9 billion fine. They are still sitting with a big stake in Kl\u00e9pierre and I\u2019m just curious, whether you as Simon, you as Kl\u00e9pierre, or you in conjunction with the third-party investor have gone to them and sort of said, hey, look, you are sitting here with $1.5 billion in this company, we can provide you some liquidity to pay your fine. David Simon : Look, they\u2019ve been a terrific partner with us. We have a very good relationship. They\u2019ve been very helpful on our involvement with Kl\u00e9pierre. So, beyond that I can\u2019t really say, Michael, anything more than that, other than they have been a pleasure to work with. And we \u2013 I have no \u2013 absolutely no indication at all that it\u2019s been a good investment for them, they like the investment, other than that, I can\u2019t really say one thing or another on that front. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Should we expect status quo out of your ownership, I mean, how should we \u2013 I mean, it was clearly a good investment, where Europe has recovered. You are able to manage through their sales process and focus them, simonize them a little bit. David Simon : Well, I do want to learn French. I think right now that\u2019s status quo, so\u2026 Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: You\u2019ve got to learn French to go up to Quebec. David Simon : That\u2019s true. That\u2019s a different kind of French. Look, I think, just from that company, and they really are better off to speak for themselves. But they have done a great job turning around, they are starting to get mojo on the property level. The balance sheet is in good shape. So, the focus for them clearly will be on external activity going forward. And I\u2019m there to help them in any way I can or and \u2013 but that\u2019s the focus. Things are going well there, and they\u2019ve done a good job. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. And just a clarification on the 3.3% total sales number you threw out, that\u2019s a quarter-over-quarter or trailing 12 number? David Simon : Trailing 12. Liz Zale : Yes. David Simon : Trailing 12. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Do you have that number of what it was quarter-over-quarter, by any chance, total sales? David Simon : We could, but I don\u2019t have it\u2026 Richard Sokolov : Don\u2019t have it in front of me\u2026 David Simon : We have it, but call Liz. She will give it to you. Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: All right. Thanks, bye. David Simon : You bet. Liz Zale : Thanks. Operator : With no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks. David Simon : All right. Thank you for your interest and your questions and have a good rest of the summer. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Ward, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Thomas Ward : Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Tom Ward, Vice President, Investor Relations. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer; Andy Juster, current Treasurer and incoming Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Please note that this call includes information that maybe accurate only as of today's date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. Also due to the completion of the Washington Prime spin-off in the second quarter, we are providing operating statistics in our supplemental 8-K for the prior year period to show performance on a comparable basis excluding the Washington Prime properties. For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David E. Simon: Okay, thanks. Good morning. We had a productive quarter. We opened 2 new Premium Outlets in Charlotte and the Twin Cities, and in Minnesota nearly 100% leased. They're both off to a great start. We successfully tendered and redeemed approximately $1.6 billion of notes. And we currently issued $1.3 billion of new notes, which extended our average duration and reduced our weighted average interest cost. And we became the first U.S. REIT to establish a global commercial paper program. We agreed to buy 2 high quality assets from the recently announced WP Glimcher deal with great growth opportunities. And most important, we continue to produce strong and operating and financial performance, both industry-leading. Now let me talk about the results. FFO reported was $1.90 per share. For those of you who updated your estimates to include the $0.35 per share charge related to our tender offers and redemption, the $1.90 exceeded the consensus by $0.05 per share. On a comparable basis, excluding the charge related to the debt distinguishment in the third quarter and the operating results from the WP properties in the prior year period, FFO diluted per share increased 14.2% year-over-year to $2.25, from $1.97 or $0.28 in total. And on the same basis, it's been increased 14.5% year-over-year to $6.48 from $5.66. Overall business conditions remain favorable driving increases in our key operating metrics and cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for space across the portfolio. Occupancy increased across the portfolio. Leasing activity is healthy. The Mall and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $9.67, an increase of 17% comp. NOI increased 5.3% in the third quarter, 5.4% year-to-date, again industry-leading. And over 95% of our domestic NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation. Total sales in our portfolio increased 2.8% in the third quarter compared to last year, and increased 2.6% for the trailing 12 months even with major redevelopment occurring at several of our Premier properties. These results are a testament to the strength of our assets and their locations and the ability to once again continue to execute new development. As I mentioned, Charlotte and Twin Cities, both opened July 31 and August 14, respectively. Premium Outlets in Montr\u00e9al will open in October 30. We expect that to be another great deal, very similar to what we built in Toronto, which is doing well, doing great. Construction continues on new Premium Outlet developments in Vancouver, and in Southern New Jersey's Gloucester Township, where the center will serve the Greater Philly area, both high-quality major markets. In Canada, a year from now, we will have centers in 3 of the best markets Toronto, Montr\u00e9al and Vancouver. And we started construction just recently on 2 new Premium Outlets in 2 great markets, Tucson and Tampa, and both scheduled to open in October of '15. And we'll continue to focus our outlet projects in major and selective markets, where we know there's a clear demand from the retailers that matter and provide solid returns to our shareholders. Redevelopment, just quickly. We opened a residential complex [indiscernible] We also opened Nordstrom and additional square footage at St. Johns Town Center and a new Bloomingdale's at Stanford Shopping Center. We also announced plans for the addition of luxury residence and an AC Hotel by Marriott to Phipps Plaza to open in -- both open early 2016 and construction for the residence will commence tomorrow. Additions to these mixed use will make our great real estate even better, and continue to make our centers the places to be from shopping, to dining, to living. Redevelopment expansions. Projects are ongoing at 31 properties across all 3 of our platforms in the U.S., Asia and Mexico, which expand and has enhanced some of the most productive properties. We started construction on 2 expansions, one at Livermore Premium Outlets in the Bay Area, that will add 185,000 square feet and is expected to open in August of 2015 and an expansion of The Colonnade at Sawgrass, expected to open December 2015 that will bring 56,000 of high-end luxury retailers to this productive mill center. And as a reminder, construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive mall properties, including but not limited to, Roosevelt Fields, Houston Galleria, Stanford Shopping Center and our Premium Outlets, including Woodbury, Las Vegas North and Chicago. When you put it all together, we have a total committed spend of $2.2 billion over the next 3 years all committed to, and all under way. Now turning to acquisitions. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jersey Gardens and University Park Village, concurrent with the closing of the Glimcher acquisition by WPG. We're excited to add these 2 great properties to our portfolio, when the deal closes in early 2015. We're also pleased with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre. And as their largest shareholder, we're excited for them and their proposed transaction to acquire Corio. Both of these transactions will be accretive to SPG's earnings. And again, demonstrate our industry-leading creativity to find unique opportunities. Capital Markets, again, very busy. I told you about the $1.3 billion notes. And we retired average duration of 1.7 that were at interest rates of 5.6%. We also redeemed another $250 million of notes at 7.875% coupon rate. Concurrently, we issued $1.3 billion of notes with an average duration of 16 years and an average coupon of 3.6.4%. This takes our senior notes from 6.3 duration to 7.6 duration and lowers our average interest rate from 4.64% to 4.4%. In addition, as I mentioned, we are the first U.S. REIT to establish a global unsecured commercial paper program. We received an A1/P1 rating from S&P and Moody's, respectively. The program has $500 million. We can issue CP in dollars and euros. And in fact, we already have. So we placed $100 million of U.S. CP, which we are borrowing at LIBOR plus 0 to 2 basis points. And our euro LIBOR, we also placed EUR 100 million at a Euro-LIBOR rate of 0 to 7 basis points. That compares to our revolving credit of 80 basis points above LIBOR. We announced our dividend of $1.30 an increase of 8%, including the November dividend, we will pay to Simon shareholders $5.15 in '14, which is an increase of 10.8% compared to, what, 2013, and does not include the dividend that if you've maintained your WP investment which is, essentially, on a share adjusted basis of $0.50 per share. We expect to raise our dividend again, of course, subject to board approval in the first quarter of 2015. Guidance. We raised our guidance to a range of $8.84 to $8.88 per share. The midpoint of this raised range is an increase of $0.15, from our prior guidance, after given effect of the charge related to the debt extinguishment. Now, let me take a deep breath, because obviously there's a lot going on. I wanted to just give you a real brief update on management team. When we announced Steve Sterrett's retirement early this year, we also said that we would source both internal and external candidates for the CFO job and that Steve would remain the CFO through 2014. We then announced our current [ph] Treasurer, Andy, would become our new CFO. Since Andy's announcement, Andy, Steve and the rest of our financial service team who, by the way, have on average of 20 years of experience with SPG, have paved the way for a smooth transition. And since that transition is now complete, effective in December, Andy will become our CFO and Brian McDade, now our Assistant Treasurer will become our Treasurer. Steve, will be available to us as needed for specific tasks. So summing it up, we had a great third quarter. We expect a strong year end. And of course we're very focused on continuing to enhance the value of our properties. And we're open for any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Michael is on the line with me as well. David, just to follow up on your comments around opening outlets centers in major markets. In buying a center like Jersey Gardens, in what type of markets do you think indoor outlet type of concept could work? And can you also provide you, mostly thoughts around the growing number of outlet centers and stores opening [indiscernible] what that means for [indiscernible] the outlook versus the overall in terms of future obsolescence? David E. Simon: Well, Jersey Gardens is, we consider it more of a Mills as opposed to an outlet center. It was essentially modeled after The Mills. So it appeals to broad consumer base, but it's got the entertainment, it's got the big boxes. It does have a smattering of pure outlet retailers. But I wouldn't -- Christie, I wouldn't consider that an outlet center, so to speak. You're -- unfortunately, we did have a not such a good connection on your question. But I think you mentioned about the potential about outlets coming closer to major metropolitan marketplaces, is that -- was that the question? Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. Yes, and what that means for obsolescence, future obsolescence of existing outlets? David E. Simon: Well, look, outlet business is very competitive. We have a good portfolio. Our results speak for themselves and I think we'll continue to be able to grow our comp NOI and our portfolio. I think in all of retail real estate, you can never stand still. You've got to invest in the products. You've got to make it better. Whether its outlets, full-priced, lifestyle, et cetera, that's what we're all about. That's what we're grounded in. Our -- we focus on lease-by-lease, market-by-market, deal-by-deal and we'll -- we live in a very competitive market. We'll continue to hopefully do well. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. There's an echo I guess, when we're asking the question. I don't know if that's partially why you may have cranking. David E. Simon: Sorry about that. We'll check in to see if we can change that by the time the call is done. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : No worries. So I also have a question on global. Obviously -- you have Kl\u00e9pierre 2.5 years ago, you went into -- you're leveraging Kl\u00e9pierre now effectively to buy Corio and consolidate in Europe. You've McArthurGlen that you've made an investment in. You obviously have the outlet business that you're growing internationally. All the Australian journalists think that they've spotted your plane in Australia which you denied. We just had a doubt there. And then, just I'm curious, how much time are you spending U.S. versus non-U.S.? As you think about the growth of Simon, how important is that international aspect going to be? David E. Simon: You mean me, personally? Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes. From -- as strategic growth initiatives. How much time are you spending outside the U.S. versus inside U.S.? David E. Simon: Well, look, generally, roughly our outlet business represents 10% of our -- from Asia to Europe to McArthurGlen. So let's say it's around 10%. Ross L. Smotrich - Barclays Capital, Research Division : International. David E. Simon: I'm sorry, our international business. And honestly, other than -- where you had the episodic nature of deals, I would tell you that I work very hard and don't feel sorry for me okay? But, so I would say to you that generally, other than episodes of deal making, I spend around the same amount of time. But we have a great team in our international. I have added a colleague that you probably haven't met that's done an unbelievable job to relieve the [indiscernible]. But I wouldn't say it's abnormally different than what the international business represents in terms of our investment. At the end of the day, we haven't made a huge -- the good news is we're in the money and everything that we've done. But when you put it in the scheme of our roughly $90 billion asset base, we haven't made this huge unbelievable bet internationally. And I spend roughly 10% of my time. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. And I was thinking more. So into the future whether that's changed at all and we see that percentage go up in well [ph] quarter of the company or 30% or 40% of the company. David E. Simon: Well, I think the -- given that what we're doing in the U.S., it's not -- that's probably not likely in any short- or medium-term horizon. Operator : Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just a quick question on the development and redevelopments. This seems like -- with the supplements for this quarter that released, the yield on expected development and redevelopments came down slightly for the mall redevelopments [indiscernible] David E. Simon: I'm glad you're very perceptive. And I'm glad you asked the question. So King of Prussia is now a go-deal, it's a big deal. And it did drop our redevelopment yield a little bit because it's -- I know you grow accustomed to Simon having 10% returns on every deal we do, sometimes a little lower. But it's still very accretive when you look at where that property is valued today. But we don't hand out or give out returns. So that -- but that, it is a major development, redevelopment, I should say, and that did lower the return. On the outlets side, I'd say 2 things : we've taken out Charlotte and Minneapolis; we've added Tucson and Tampa. Charlotte and Minneapolis were very high double digits. Tucson and Charlotte -- I'm sorry, Tucson and Tampa are on average 11. The others were higher than that. So when you bring that 2 together, it dropped it a touch. Now I will say to this, we're very conservative on our new development, both Tucson and Tampa are double digits. But the way they're coming in and the other 2 that are coming out, dropped it, oh, so small. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. That's really more of a mix... David E. Simon: Let me be perfectly clear. We have no execution issue. We have no cost overrun. It's just the mix, changed by the addition of the plaza, the King of Plaza, and then the 2 outlets opened and the 2 new ones coming in. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Morgan from MLV. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : The re-leasing spreads is also just fixed on a bid . I mean, I know there's some noise. But you've kind of been in an upward trend and it is a rolling 12. So I just wanted to maybe get any comments on spreads, your outlook for them, whether the changes and -- whether the sales volatility has had any impact? And that's the question. David E. Simon: Well, look, it wasn't that long ago, say, less than a year ago where the spreads we're 14%, 15%. So I will just tell you, from our standpoint we are pleased with basically having 9, 9.5-plus-dollar spread. And 17% -- I mean, I wouldn't -- we have to look at this a little bit on a longer-term basis. So I would say, we're very pleased with 17. It's higher than it was a year ago. Yes, it this a little bit lower than the Q1 and Q2. I certainly wouldn't overreact on that on any basis. The re-leasing spreads are driving our industry-leading 5.4% year-to-date comp NOI growth. And we're -- we are executing this in a clearly, a cautious consumer oriented environment. And obviously last year, the consumer shut down a little bit because of weather, this, that and the other things. So I'm pleased, I'm happy. And I think we're executing very well. We're going through our -- in terms of how we look at that next year, very simple, as you know, we've been doing this 20 years. We had the pleasure of starting November 10, I believe, going through each and every mall, lease-by-lease, deal-by-deal, which rolls into our plan which we'll share with you in early next year. And so until that's done, I don't have a prediction about what our spreads will be other than we continue to believe we're -- our rollovers are under market [indiscernible] in the future growth of our business industry-leading opportunities, in my opinion has been reinforced by year-after-year-after-year of continual unabated outperformance. Richard S. Sokolov: The only thing that I would also add is that our occupancy cost remains very moderate, which shows you that we still have plenty of room to grow those rents. Stephen E. Sterrett: Yes. Paul, this is Steve. I'll just add one thing. If you look at our 8-K, over the last 8 quarters we've consistently signed new leases between $63 and $67 a foot, and if you look at our lease expiration schedule you can see that they're still in the mid-40s for the next several years. So we still feel very good about marketing the expiring leases to market. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Yes, I know you haven't giving guidance, but that kind of high teens number is -- there's no reason to think that that's not sustainable it's not maybe potential upside. David E. Simon: Well, look, we -- we're -- I know you're, Paul you're smart and you want us to talk about next year. We have tremendous confidence in our business and our platform and the thing that I would have you rely on is what we've done year-after-year. And as I said to you, we'll share our guidance early next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I'm also here with Craig, who will have a question after me. My question was just focused on Sears' decision to lease space to Primark. Also, Amazon's announcement to open a store in New York City, we've been getting a lot of incoming calls, questions on those announcements, and what that could mean. If you could just provide some thoughts on those announcements and maybe where you think things continue with Sears in their leasing efforts? David E. Simon: Well let me -- I'll have -- I'll give you 2 quick top of the head remarks and then I'll let Rick add whatever he wants. Look, on Amazon, leasing space, I'm not -- it's, all the details aren't out, but there's clearly a benefit for the overused word, omnichannel bricks and clicks, however you want to describe it, there's a real benefit. In fact, it's very interesting when I see Sears as a online retailer, depending on which study you look at. I mean, they're anywhere from -- they're clearly in the top 10. They may be as high as #5. And I would argue it's because of their physical presence that allows them to be so important in the online presence. And you've heard it from retailers that the synergy between having the physical and the online presence and now the move toward mobile, and how its all been integrated. So -- and clearly, we've seen a number of pure online retailers going to physical stores. So the -- it's got to be in the equation for a retailer to have a physical presence. I don't think there's any question in that. And as our retailers have gotten more sophisticated in the online world, I think that's going to play to our benefit. On the Sears leasing, we have one that we've consented to in King of Prussia. That was part of their agreement to consent to our ability to expand the 2 centers. We worked very collectively to do that. I think Sears would be the first to tell you that in certain markets and certain stores they don't underperform, or in fact they have too much space. And they will look to release some of that space or sell some of the real estate. We still think they have a physical presence that's going to be important to them. And we'll continue to work with them on a collaborative basis that meets our needs, and our shoppers' needs and theirs. And we expect to, at the end of the day, for both of us to benefit from that. Richard S. Sokolov: And what I would add is that focusing on the Primark side, they're a highly productive iconic retailer in Europe and the U.K. We have been working with them for over 6 months. We have already visited them at their headquarters and toured their stores, where they operate. And we're very excited about their entry into the U.S. We anticipate that there will hopefully be several other opportunities, both within our portfolio or others Sears stores, which they have already alluded too. And I would also point out that we got involved with Primark early on as our Kl\u00e9pierre team already had a preexisting relationship with them. Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Craig has one question. David E. Simon: We've all concluded that we are all just [indiscernible] so we just want to go on record for that. Alright? Richard S. Sokolov: Us too. Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. I was just going to ask what were some of the take aways from your shopping block events? And just maybe some general thoughts on the millennials in the malls. David E. Simon: Well, look I think, they're an important customer base. I think they represent a unique opportunity for us. The millennials represent a bigger population than the baby boomers. So it's very important for us to connect with them, the way they want to be connected. I think they like mall shopping. And we're going to experiment and do lots of things oriented around them to continue to make them an important consumer base, in our properties. But we're not going to ignore the baby boomers either because they have a lot to spend. So I think as millennials get older and we can continue to offer them entertainment, restaurant and the right retailers in that -- in the properties, and connect with them the way they want to be connected, it's a great opportunity for us. Rick, do you want to add anything? Richard S. Sokolov: The only thing I would say to echo David's point, the research that we've done has shown that the millennials are, in fact, very supportive of the mall channel and are very much focused on going on there. And so it's a natural thing for us to try and exploit and enhance. Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I was also noticing, you used 2 outlets to do the initial rollout, with Refinery29. How did those go? David E. Simon: Very well. So that relationship is early, but I'd say generally we're very pleased. We're creating buzz in that whole marketplace. And are -- along those lines, Craig, we're making some initial investments in early-stage companies to really to enhance the environment. But, I think, all the good news is that there is a lot that we can do to enhance our environments and we are as committed as anyone to do that. We've got the balance sheet, the capital the -- hopefully, the creativity and the willingness to take risk to do that which all companies, I think, need to be in this position to do. It would be easy for us to rest on our industry-leading growth. But as you know us very well, that is not in our DNA. And so, we're going to do it from marketing, to leasing, to development and everywhere in between. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is actually Caitlin Burrows. Retailers have been open about the needs for a physical presence to showcase, even though much of their sales are generated online. Can you talk about how you capture the economic value of a store that doesn't necessarily run through that store's cash register? David E. Simon: Well, look, there's -- it's -- that's -- in our leases, even if it's done in the store but fulfilled online that's part of our sales. That's not really too much of an issue. And I think for all physical retailers the important -- and even with their online business, they have a multiplier effect, that's very important, that they see when they have a physical presence with their online consumers. And they can describe it in great detail on it. And it's anywhere from 3x to 4x. So the convergence is there. It's happening. And the good news is our retailers are combating effectively the pure online retailer. And the online retailer understands for them to, beyond the first mover advantage that someone like Amazon had, in order for them to really grow their business, I think and many, many believe, they need to have a physical presence because of the way it's moved to mobile and the way it's -- the multiplier effect that the omnichannel world is presenting itself in. So that bears, I think, extremely well for us in creating the next wave of retailers. We don't -- we see that just beginning. So, the -- the interesting thing is, the online retailers have still got this unbelievable advantage and we see it ourselves in [indiscernible]Nexus. And giving that benefit, even though they should be collecting that used tax instead of sales tax, but taking advantage of that benefit that the consumer's not necessarily are entitled to. As that has begun to swing, because a lot of them have Nexus now with warehouses and the like. As that has balanced, that's going to level the playing field, obviously, it would be great. We can get Congress to level that playing field which they should be doing, that I think that's going to reinforce the advantages of bricks and mortar. Because at the end of the day, when you're looking to shop, the mobile device or even the desktop really can't present the goods and services that are available with that retailer that a physical environment can. Yes, they can save you the sales or use tax, yes, they may have an advantage in convenience, which is slowly being dealt with by our retailers through pickup-in-store, ship from store, but once that's sales tax, use tax advantage is eliminated, which I think it will be through Nexus for the government, we'll see that. I think our retailers can be really damn competitive. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just on the topic of equal playing field. So Amazon now charges sales tax in 23 states. And what else is remaining to be on topic of tax parity? Is there anything that you guys are doing? David E. Simon: Well, we're trying. But there are roadblocks in Congress and we're not here to complain about the government, believe me. But we just want a level complaint -- level playing field and then the consumer is going to make that choice, but they shouldn't be -- they -- and we should let the states decide how they want to deal with it, but it should be level. And at the end of the day, the best retailer, the best mall operator will come out ahead. I think it's got to be level, it's just not right. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : So a couple of quick questions. First, about going back to the Sears topic. If Sears decides to lease their space -- sublease their space on their own, do you guys generally have veto power or do other anchors at the center have veto power and is there any chance that you can partake on the upside assuming they granted us prior money anything upside [indiscernible]. David E. Simon: Well, there's 2 questions there. We certainly have substantial ability to control what Sears can do with their stores based on existing leases or reciprocal easement agreements, so that is, yes. With respect to the upside, to the extent the transaction is being done by Sears within their store, with their capital, it's their transaction, but we certainly benefit in a position like where you're adding a Primark in or a Dick's in King of Prussia, that certainly will strengthen our overall offering for our shoppers, but not financially if it's being done inside the Sears store with Sears capital. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Do other anchors have a stake? David E. Simon: It depends on the documents and depends on the scope of what Sears is contemplating with their building. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just last question for me. On Kl\u00e9pierre, if I understand the deal correctly, it's going to be a full stock deal, between Kl\u00e9pierre and Koreo [ph] which would in effect dilute your equity stake from the 29% roughly to sub-20%. And I'm sure you'll let me know if I got this wrong. Any thoughts on re-upping your equity stake in Kl\u00e9pierre? David E. Simon: Well, you don't have it wrong, but I'm not going to answer that question. We like the investment. It's been a very good investment for us. We think as a reference shareholder and as -- and being on the board, we've added real value and we are in a -- obviously, we do believe in the merger or acquisition of Koreo [ph], and we support it and we believe that scale in our business is really important because it -- on all sorts of fronts, capital, retailer relationships, ability to invest in the consumer experience, et cetera. So we're optimistic that, that investment will continue to be good for us and grow in value. But I really can't tell you about whether or not, going forward, we'll increase our stake. But we're pleased and we think there is still opportunity going forward with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. I mean, the reason I asked is it seems [indiscernible]. David E. Simon: I understand. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : [indiscernible] David E. Simon: And I hope you understand why I couldn't answer it. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : No, I got that. It just seems like a nice area where we could put maybe $1.5 billion of additional capital at a very attractive -- well roughly a cost capital for a very attractive yield. So that's why I asked. David E. Simon: Yes. It was in the yield on our investment in Europe in both at Kl\u00e9pierre and McArthurGlen and in Asia they have been fantastic. I mean, they've been yields so -- and that's what helped drive our industry-leading growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Steve, congrats on the even earlier retirement. So a question on Japan, I mean, I try to channel my inner David Harris. If we read the headlines correctly, retail sales in Japan have been impacted because of the increase in sales tax and yet your productivity over there is actually up year-over-year. So is it just a nuance of when the tax hit or is there a difference going on from what the newspapers are reporting versus what's going on at your outlets? David E. Simon: Well, I think our outlets are just so uniquely positioned and with the increase in VAT -- there, clearly, you have some forward spending and then it did have an initial monthly impact, but then it's kind of leveled back. I just think the consumer there is going to look for even more value given the higher VAT rates. So we just have a unique portfolio that will continue to perform, but it's affected retail sales generally, but it's really good to be in the value space there with great product and a great retailer line up. But don't kid yourself. I mean, when you increase your VAT, you're going to affect consumption. We're just a little bit better positioned to deal with it than some other property types. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. And then as far as the Sears transaction goes, did the fact that Ed [ph] is going direct with retailers, does this sort of indicate that basically the gap is too wide versus what he thinks his boxes are worth and what the mall landlords think it's worth and therefore, he's just going direct or do you think that we will see some more trades? Because it would seem like the value of his boxes is maximized if you guys can get control of it and do what you want to do with it versus him doing something with it? David E. Simon: Well, look, I keep -- look, there is a long -- we've had a, let's see, 50-some-odd year relationship with Sears through a lot of ups and downs and good times and so on. We expect to continue to have a excellent relationship. I don't think any thing is off the table, buying, selling, leasing, subleasing, working cooperatively, nothing's off the table there. Again, I think the market wants to take one scenario, extrapolate it, I appreciate that. Just like they want to take one Amazon space. It's in fact, they're doing it and extrapolate it. I don't think you're going to extrapolate anything like that. And we will -- they were -- on the Primark of King of Prussia given where they are situated in the mall and what they had already done with the one level which we cooperated, and we felt like Primark would be a very good replacement where they're situated plus we needed their cooperation. What we are trying to accomplish and it happened to be that we were absolutely aligned and that set of circumstances, and we think we created a win-win. Now I would expect given the 55-year history that we'll continue to find those kind of situations with Sears in most cases. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from ISI Group. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to just follow up on the Primark situation. We understand in Europe and London, there are kind of primarily 35,000-foot boxes. And I think the initial 7 they're taking much larger footprint. So I know you haven't announced direct deals with them, but do you anticipate or would you envision sort of more Sears sublease space? Or do you actually think you could do direct deals with them? And would you envision them kind of being an in-line tenant if [indiscernible]? David E. Simon: No, and obviously I won't. It'll depend upon the set of circumstances. And just because the King of Prussia is one deal that we consented to doesn't necessarily mean that, that's going to be the model on all the others. So Steve, like I said, it's going to be a case-by-case scenario. I would be -- if their model is a success here, which certainly by every indication of the presence they have in Europe, you would potentially anticipate, but others have come here and have not done as well, but let's -- if it is, then I think it'll be a combination of all the above where there will be some consent with Sears on subleases, we'll lease directly. We'll redevelop pads and the like. It's all going to depend upon the set of circumstances that present itself from that property. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, part of your first answer got cut off. So I apologize if I didn't hear the whole thing. Just in terms of kind of the type of tenent they are, the price points, do you envision that they could sort of fit into a large part of the portfolio? Or do you see them in different kind of segments within the portfolio? David E. Simon: Well, they're certainly not a luxury. So our higher-end properties probably not a great fit, but I'm going to wait and see and see how what their store looks like in the U.S., how they're -- what kind of consumer they're delivering and we'll go from there. In that King of Prussia was relatively a simple decision for us because of where that Sears box is and I think again, it's going to be dependent upon the circumstances. And I hope you can hear [ph]. I guess we're having serious problems with our communication, but I hope you can hear it, Steve. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : No, I did. And just last question. In terms of kind of the home delivery [ph] how was that sort of progressed with mall lease in general? Are there changes you're making for this upcoming holiday season and just kind of what's been early I guess maybe coming up on one year? How do you think that system and service were working? David E. Simon: Well, the lift is one of -- just one of our efforts along those lines. I think, we're pleased as a group. They've signed up a couple of major, major retailers. And they're starting to do shipping this holiday season. And I do think, over time, there clearly is going to be the ability to deliver or pick up a lot of mall goods at the mall environment. And I think we're, as an industry and individually, we're just scratching the surface there. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy [indiscernible] from EBS Security. Unknown Analyst : Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one, it looks like you sold an asset this quarter and recorded a close to $80 million gain, just any color on that sale? David E. Simon: No, just a couple of assets that didn't fit the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : David, I wanted to get updated read from you on the upcoming holiday season. You like some of your peers noted last quarter that consumers are in a bit of a cautious state. How would you assess that mood today? And in conjunction with that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this year's back-to-school shopping season materialize your expectations. And what you read on the consumer pulse today and your expectation for the approaching holiday season. David E. Simon: Simplistically, consumer, I believe, is -- continues to be somewhat cautious. The good news is, there's an environment, where I think, at some point in the near future, they will be less cautious, lower oil or lower gas prices, better job environment. Hopefully, wage growth, continuation of lower interest rates, just some of those out there. But they're still cautious. And that's how we're planning, so we're running our business. I don't like -- I am not equipped to make a forecast on the holiday season. Others might, I will not. There's lots of forecasters out there on the holiday season. The ones that I see are generally feel like it's going to be a [indiscernible] last year. Weather, hopefully, won't replicate itself the way it was, longer season, to name a couple, but I don't -- I'm not in that business. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Care to share any comments on this year's back-to-school shopping season? David E. Simon: The -- I think it was generally spotty. I mean, I think, it was certainly wasn't robust, and I think it still represented the cautious consumer. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And just one or two things here. First, at the recent Jersey Gardens and UPV acquisitions will hit the same store in 1Q '16. And then any color on the lease termination fees? I was wondering if there are any other nonrecurring items in the quarter beyond because it looks like $0.02 of our lease termination fees and the debt prepayment charges. David E. Simon: Typically, on Jersey Gardens, they wouldn't be in our comp NOI for '16, that's correct. And, look, listen. We've got -- given it's complicated, we are a big company. So we're always going to have other income that could be higher or lower quarter-to-quarter, same thing on the expense side. The -- but as far as I can -- having examined the financials, extremely closely, nothing jumps out at me. Lease income, lease settlement income, probably in the scheme of the total years. It's not all that different than some other previous years. It does ebb and flow. We've always got a little bit of extra income here and an extra expense, year in and year out given the nature of our business. But nothing to highlight frankly. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I've question about, I guess, I call the value proposition of SPG Asset Management. If you were to benchmark the in-place rents to the 2 malls that you are buying from Glenshire [ph] to similar malls that you already own. What do you think the delta is at revenue or NOI per square foot that you could realize under your management? It there a way to estimate or quantify that for us? David E. Simon: Well, a very good question, Jeff. I would say to you generally, we don't buy any asset if we don't feel like we can improve it. And there's -- so that's kind of a thing that we have regardless of what we do, whether it's new development, redevelopment or importantly, acquisitions. What can we do to beat the growth rate that may exist. If that asset is -- just sits there unowed [ph], but the fact of matter is, I'm not going to give you a number on that. I mean, I -- people are, again, not to put this in context, but Sawgrass is a unique animal, but when we took it over, I remember the numbers more or less correctly. It was around $55 million of NOI. And next year, we did add a little bit of space here and there and stuff but next year, generally, I think it's going to do around 130-ish. Now we haven't gone lease-by-lease. There we might skip lease-by-lease because it could take us 3 days. But I think the fact that we were able to do that, not only helps our investors, but also helps the consumers and the retailers because I think they did a lot more business with it in our hands. So we invested more in it, we drove the tourism. We've got better retailers. We've got more consumers. The retailers did more business and everybody was copacetic even though Mills have done a good job at $55 million or whatever the rough number was. So, we think, we can drive more traffic to Jersey Gardens though I firmly believe Glenshire [ph] has done a great job with that asset. So that we're experts in tourism. It's right by Newark Airport. I think we can figure out how to get a few more buses from Newark to go to Jersey before they go to -- Rick and I will flag them ourselves if we have to make the numbers work. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Maybe, Steve, that could be your next career move. Actually, a follow up also, David, as it relates to the products you're looking at Copley Place in Boston there's a lot residential product in the pipeline in Boston for sale, as well as for rent. Does that give you any pause with proceeding on that project? Or are you sort of passed the point of no return? Or are you not as concerned about it? David E. Simon: Well, we're always focused on supply. We are not passed the point of no return. And we're still working on approval rights, both within the appropriate agencies in Boston, but also, we have to work through some of the retailer issues. So we are not at the point of no return and we studied the supply [indiscernible] similarly. And it's going to be a gut check decision here, I would say, Jeff, in the next 3 or 4 months. Generally, we still feel very, very confident about it, but that the -- this is a little bit different than what we've done historically, as you might imagine. We are really good experts on supply, understanding supply and retail, what's going to get done, what's going to have an impact in competitive world, very competitive world in retail. This one is a little bit different. We hired a couple of great experts to do comp lease. And we've got the in-house expertise. We also obviously hired the right people in Boston to help us go through that exercise, but it's a good question. It's going to be a gut check time, but we have not passed the point of no return. And, as you know, in real estate, whether it's office, retail, whatever, there's always announcements of some supply. The real question is what gets built and who gets there first and who's got staying power. I will tell you this, it's an iconic asset, it's only getting better. The design is fantastic. Boston is a great long-term city and that Lord I hope -- we have staying power. So we've got a lot of stuff on our side of the equation that gives us confidence that if we do pull the trigger, we will execute. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And maybe just a last question for Rick. I know you touched on spreads and on sympathetic to looking at it over long-term. But someone had asked earlier about the pullback in the dollar spread and that came back a little bit slightly this quarter. Is that just a function of mix maybe in the quarter? Or was there any kind of pushback from retailers in light of the softer retail sales? Richard S. Sokolov: There really has been no pushback from the retailers in terms of their demand. And it's basically a function of mix. What yields come in, in a given period of time. So we're still seeing a very focused retailer, the one space. And candidly, you can look at that with our occupancy and with all that activity that we have going on in the portfolio. David E. Simon: Yes. And let me -- because, again, this is a good question, it's a good focus, but let me -- let you -- I want you to understand how we think about the business. If we owned 1 property, we could absolutely maximize rent to the last penny because at the end of the day, that's all we would care about. Jeff, we believe in repeat business with our retailers. So we're always calibrating -- and we don't -- we're not perfect at this. Believe me, we make mistakes all the time. But we're always trying to calibrate the win-win, all right? How do you keep the retailer who is our -- is our customer in addition to the consumer happy? How do we reach our financial goals? But we are not getting the last dollar because we do multiple deals, multiple business with them, year-after-year, day-after-day. And so we're never going to maximize rents if we just owned 1 asset. And -- so I -- you just need to have that lens on. Yes, even with that lens on, we still out produce everybody else, but we're not trying to get to the point of no return. We're trying to find that balance. And I'll be the first to tell you, sometimes we don't do it, sometimes we make mistakes, but we're always trying to find that balance for future positive relations with our clients going forward. Just like any other business. So let's put that in that perspective, okay? But that's why we have the opportunity to find other opportunities that even though we may not maximize the spread being $9.67, is that the right number? Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes. David E. Simon: It could've been $10. Maybe that $0.33 we picked up because they're going to do this and that and the other thing for us. So there's always that balance. And you've got to put it in that lens. And it's important to understand that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cowen. James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just a quick follow-up to Jeff's question on Copley and I understand it's not at the point that it's finalized as you explained. But can you give us kind of a ballpark number that the project would entail in terms of total cost? David E. Simon: Yes, sure. It's around -- the total cost, Jim, is around $5.50. And again, the vision that we have on the -- the top roughly 10 floors would be condo sales. We're also expanding Neimans as part of it and other retail. So we look at it gross, but then we have condo sales to net. And that differential, well it's an art, not necessarily a science, that differential and then we own the multi-family. That differential is roughly, don't hold me to these numbers, it's roughly a $300 million-ish differential. That puts it in this kind of financial consequence box. And that number, from a return, as we look at it, that return is acceptable given what we're doing there, okay? And I don't want it -- I'm not going to give you that number just yet, but when we go it'll be in our 8-K, but that's essentially how we're thinking about the deal. James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just a kind of follow-up question on the earlier discussion about Primark as well. I know you had mentioned Primark, ZARA, H&M on the second quarter call. And, obviously, the European retailers, they're kind of categorized as fast session apparel, I guess, Primark this more promotional. And all 3 have already have sizable market shares in Europe where they operate alongside smaller higher-priced, higher price point apparel retailers. Also, we obviously have, for every 21 UNIQLO growing aggressively here, I'm just curious, if we assume that these large-format retailers continue to grow their share of apparel sales, do you view that as a positive or a negative regarding the same property NOI growth prospects of this domestic Simon portfolio? Richard S. Sokolov: It's Rick. I think that we price our real estate based on what we believe is the value of the real estate. And everyone is going to have to compete for that real estate. The bottom line is that it has taken H&M a very long time. They are now happily established and growing substantially. We're working with ZARA, but frankly, we have a lot of very established domestic retailers here that are very competitive and continuing to grow. So the more people we have are interested in our properties, the better off we are will enhance this demand and our job is to do the right tenant mix and to price the space right, and I think we've been doing pretty well so far. David E. Simon: Yes, but it's a good question and its again, it's a little more art than science. You've got to weigh the traffic that they may generate versus the competitive nature they may put certain retailers under. And whether or not they're bringing a different consumer in. So you put it all together and you got to make judgment calls day in and day out. So -- but it's a good question and it's an art. You got to be very, very thoughtful about that, Jim. James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Then finally for me, and I maybe asking you to repeat yourself, David, but, I think, you did cut out on this. In terms of the Primark deal at King of Prussia, you mentioned it was, I think, is an easier decision because of the specific location. Can you just clarify what you meant by that? David E. Simon: Well, if you've been to the mall, they're -- in this case, the Sears box is not as well located as if it were in the middle of the mall. And our decision may have been a little bit different had it been. And it just -- so it's really a location issue. And the power of that mall is shifting in terms of kind of a focal point given our expansion is now -- we're actually under construction and it was really -- we felt good about it, and we've got Sears' cooperation on what we were trying to accomplish to improve the mall, and we did think that because of their position, Primark would be great to drive traffic down to that wing. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just a quick question. On last quarter, you guys talked about a couple of deals on the development side that were not outlets. I'm just curious if there's anything to update on that front. David E. Simon: You mean on full price? Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Right. David E. Simon: Yes. We are getting closer, not quite there, but we're working diligently on 1 ground-up full-price development that, I'd say over the next short period of time, that we'll be making an announcement on. It's not quite everything is done, but we are optimistic that this will be a partnership that we're looking forward to, to working on, but it's not quite all done, handshakes in place, but stay tuned on that. We think it'll be great and it will be besides the redevelopment, it will be our first full price now in quite some time. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And do you have a rough size sort of size? David E. Simon: The total investment will be north of $200 million. And we're going to be around the 50% owner. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JP Morgan. Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I'm curious, if you would weight your sales based on mall NOI, how different would that number be compared to the $613 that you report? David E. Simon: Great question. It would be much higher. But that's a great question because -- it's a great question and in fact, because every dollar is the same, it doesn't really -- it doesn't, obviously, doesn't do that. But the fact is we could do it, but I don't have the [indiscernible] about 10% higher. Stephen E. Sterrett: Yes, 10% higher. David E. Simon: 10%. Steve Sterrett -- he's leaving so I wouldn't count on any numbers that he said. Steve Sterrett says its 10%, but, I think, we could probably do a little bit more work and get a better number, but is a very interesting question. Operator : There are no further questions so I'll turn it back to David Simon for closing remarks. David E. Simon: Okay. Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. You can disconnect and have a great day.",

David Simon : Good morning, we had strong results to wrap up in exceptional 2014. We open Premium Outlets Montreal, started construction on two new Premium Outlets in strong and growing markets of Tampa and Tucson. We announced our first new full-price development project in the last several years with The Shops at Clearfork in Ft. Worth, Texas, anchored by Neiman Marcus and most importantly we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. Results in the quarter, were highlighted by FFO of $2.47 per share. On a comparable basis, excluding the operating results from WPG properties in the prior year period, our FFO per diluted share increased 12.3% for the quarter or $0.27 year-over-year. As a reminder, our FFO per diluted share is calculated strictly in accordance with the NAREIT white paper. We encourage the industry to acknowledge the importance of using this long standing measure without modification. Our fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was impacted by approximately $0.04 from our share of Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s costs related to both their bond tender offer and their tender offer for Corio, as well as unfavorable effects of foreign currency devaluations. For the year, on a comparable basis excluding the operating results from the WPG properties, the spin-off transactions and the debt extinguishment charge FFO per diluted share increased 13.9% after taking into account this spin-off and debt charge, we beat our initial guidance of 2014 that we provided to you by an impressive $0.40. We continue to record strong key operating metrics and cash flow. Occupancy increased across the portfolio and our malls and premium outlets combined occupancy ended at the year at record 97.1%. Leasing activity is healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded releasing spreads of $9.59 per square foot, an increase of 16.6%. Comp NOI increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to an increase of 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and an increase in total of 5.1%. So we had an increase of 4%, over an increase of 6.1% last year. And as a reminder, approximately 95% of our domestic property NOI is included in our comp NOI calc. Total sales in our portfolio increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter, compared to last year even with major redevelopment occurring at several of our Premier properties. As I said, we open Montr\u00e9al October 30 the great excitement, we commenced construction in Tampa and Tucson and the construction in New Jersey with the Gloucester Premium, Philadelphia Premium Outlets continues to move forward, all of those will open in 2015. And we are slated to begin construction of four new domestic premium outlets in 2015, which include Columbus, Ohio, Clarksburg, Maryland, Norfolk, Virginia and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Now during the quarter, even with all that new development we completed several redevelopments including the addition of Nordstrom and small shop expansions at St. Johns Town Center, the relocation of Bloomingdale\u2019s at Stanford Shopping Center, as well as the expansions at premium outlets in Mexico City and Toki Premium Outlets in Japan. We started construction in King of Prussia we are underway with the expansion to connect Plaza and the Court. Then we\u2019ll add approximately 150,000 square feet. The Pennsylvania\u2019s top retail destination and is expected to be completed in August of 2016. And at Phipps Plaza we are adding in AC Hotel by Marriott, and luxury residents, both expected to be completed in 2016, as well. Construction continues on major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive mall properties, including Roosevelt Field, Houston Galleria, Stanford, and our premium outlets in Woodbury Common, Las Vegas North, Livermore, San Francisco and Chicago. These major redevelopments are to be completed in late 2015 and 2016. Redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing, that is under construction across all three of our platforms in the U.S. and Asia. And have a total committed spend of $2.1 billion. So again that\u2019s under construction. Acquisitions we closed on Jersey Gardens and University Park Village for $1.09 billion on January 15, and are excited to include these great properties and portfolio. And both Jersey Gardens and UPV has sales per square foot of $850 per foot. Let me turn to Kl\u00e9pierre. We are pleased with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre. Our net equity investment is up $850 million even with the weaker Euro, and as their largest shareholder we\u2019re excited for them as 94% of our Corio shares were tendered in support of Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s acquisition and once the merger is completed expected by the end of the first quarter the integration of the two companies will begin. Now, let\u2019s talk about our balance sheet. We ended 2014 with a debt-to-market capitalization ratio of 29% industry-leading. Our interest coverage was 3.8 times industry-leading, net to EBITDA of 5.4 times industry-leading. Our long-term issuer rating, of A and A2, continues to be industry-leading. So let\u2019s not lose sight of the significant differentiating and positive attribute of our balance sheet, as compared to our peer group. A few other capital market activities other way this replaces Rick\u2019s listing of tenants, we\u2019ve retired $2.9 billion of senior notes at an average coupon they were at 5.76%, we issued $2.5 billion of new notes within weighted average term of 12 years and a weighted average coupon at 3.32%, we amended and extended our $4 billion revolver until 2019, we closed 60 new mortgages within weighted average interest rate and term of 3.29%, and 8.4 years and we became the first U.S. REIT to establish a global commercial paper program issuing $400 million of CP at an weighted average interest rate of 18 basis points. So let\u2019s turning to the dividend, we announced our dividend this quarter of $1.40 per share, an increase year-over-year of 12%. We will pay at least $5.60 in dividends of 2015, which is an increase of 8.7% compared to the last year in totality. And if we include WP\u2019s dividend, we\u2019ve more than doubled our divided since the great recession. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance, our guidance of FFO is $9.60 to $9.70 per share. This range represents 8% to 9% growth compared to our reported FFO per share of $8.90 for 2014. Our range is based on comparable NOI growth of approximately 4% for our malls, Premium Outlets and mills platforms it also assumes no additional acquisition or disposition activity beyond what we just completed with Jersey Gardens and UPV. And it also includes the unfavorable impact to recent currency devaluations which should approximate $0.10, compared to the currency levels that existed in 2014.  So let\u2019s conclude. We produced another exceptional year with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2014 beating guidance for an unprecedented 10 plus years in a row. We achieved record levels in occupancy, FFO per share and dividends despite the loss of approximately $1 per share of FFO from WP and the debt extinguishment charge. And we continue to improve our portfolio and consumer and customer services for the benefit of stakeholders and we\u2019re very excited about 2015. We are ready for any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed. Ross Nussbaum : Hey David good morning. I guess it\u2019s on first what\u2019s coming I guess I get the honor of asking you what the heck is going on with may search? David Simon : Well, I thought we are going to talk about your headline that said mix bag? So what was mix bag? Our record revenue growth or record comp NOI growth, our record balance sheet, our record occupancy, our record rental rates, I wanted to talk about your headline first. Can we do that? Ross Nussbaum : Yes, we can all read the note, but the guidance coming in below the Street is an offset to beating for the quarter. One would call that perhaps a mix bag, but we can talk about with all that. David Simon : I think on the guidance, look, first of all those are your numbers, not ours. And obviously, that\u2019s predominantly driven by the currency devaluation that\u2019s occurring both with respect to the Yen and Euro. The good news is even with that, because of our at least our hedge in Europe, we\u2019re up $850 million in Kl\u00e9pierre. So yes we\u2019re going to have some volatility, it\u2019s about 1% of our - this where the rates are today versus where they are, it\u2019s above 1% of our earnings, which to me is somewhat immaterial. So I do think we need to put that in perspective. I\u2019m not sure that should have generated your headline, but you certainly understand our position, I understand yours. Ross Nussbaum : I appreciate that. So back to the elephant in the room. David Simon : Yes, what\u2019s your question? Ross Nussbaum : A little California-based mall company called Macerich, what can you tell us about, what\u2019s currently going on? What was going through your head a couple of months ago when you put out the announcement that you did? What can you say about it? David Simon : Well, look. As much as we - I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love to talk about, we disclosed our stake of - was 4.1% and got diluted down to 3.6% in Macerich, we still hold that position and at this point it\u2019s really not appropriate for me to add anything other than the fact that we still own it. And there\u2019s not a lot more I can say, actually let me take away the clarifying statement, there\u2019s nothing more I can add to that. Ross Nussbaum : You may not want to answer this, but I will ask it anyway. If there were nothing going on one might assume you would be happy to tell us that you own a position in another company, that you thought the stock was undervalued at the time. But if you can\u2019t comment on it would suggest that there is something going on other than that. David Simon : Well, look we don\u2019t - we never comment on M&A activity. And we still own the stake. And as you know we\u2019re significantly in the money of this on the stake, there is been no P&L impact on our stake as I know some people asked Tom that question. And it is what it is, there is nothing really I can add other than that. And I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t, but there\u2019s nothing more that I can add to that. Ross Nussbaum : All right, I and my mixed bag will get back in the queue. David Simon : Sorry listen, you know, it\u2019s a two-way street, you give it today we\u2019re going to give it back a little bit anyway. That\u2019s what you like about us. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed. Michael Bilerman : Yes it is Michael Bilerman with Christy. David, let me just try just a different angle. When you made the statement you said you may seek a waiver, and you put that out publicly. So at least can you comment on whether you\u2019ve made the ask for the waiver and if there has been a response? And if you haven\u2019t made the ask why haven\u2019t you? And then the second part is just the intent of taking the stake. And was it solely for the purpose of a passive investment just to you thought you had a lot of cash hanging around, so buy something that you think - you can\u2019t buy assets in the private market, so buy something that you know really well that you think is trading at a discount, make money and go home? Or was it made for the purpose of moving forward with a non-passive agenda? David Simon : Well, I can\u2019t - Ross ask a question I can\u2019t add to that other than, we have manage defined investments was evidence by the little over $1 billion that we just spent in January 15 by two really good assets with really good growth potential that we think this year will yield terrific results. I\u2019m still an old fashioned real estate guy, I like current yield going in and the current yield going in is very attractive with once Rick and The Mills team certainly with Jersey Gardens, works their magic I think we got a lot upside. And not to say that I think Michael Glimcher did a great job with that asset. But there\u2019s nothing I can add other than what I said to Ross just earlier Michael. And I\u2019m sorry. But as you know it\u2019s just inappropriate for me to comment further. Christy McElroy : Hi, its Christy McElroy here with Michael. Just following-up on the currency and the impact to 2015, you mentioned that $0.10 impact embedded in your guidance. How are you thinking about hedging that exposure potentially, would you to expect pick on more debts provided natural hedge or may be put in place any other foreign currency hedges, just want to get a sense for how that\u2019s rolling through the numbers? And then just related to that I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen any impact at all from the stronger dollar in terms of a change in traffic or sales at any of your centers that have a higher international tourism component to the customer base. David Simon : Sure I\u2019m happy to answer those. So let\u2019s just talk about the net. We\u2019re pretty well hedged on the Kl\u00e9pierre initial stake, though we are not as hedge with our McArthurGlen investment. The problem as you know to get the perfect hedge and with rates as lowest they are in the Euro, you\u2019re never going to make up that. But I would say generally, we\u2019re reasonably hedged in the Euro in kind of the 80%, 90% range. But since rates - with debt, but with rates are so low there, the math is such that, it\u2019s still going to have an impact on us. So the good news that I see at least is that the business there is not necessarily reflecting the devaluation. So I think the consumer there is still shopping and doing that. And so, I think it\u2019s kind of more of a temporary thing. But it\u2019s going to impact us for next year. And it is what it is the same thing with the Yen in a sense that from a book value point of view, we\u2019re basically completely hedged. But again, the Yen\u2019s rates are so low, there\u2019s just no way to do it. Now, we\u2019ve locked in some forwards on the dividend yields. I\u2019m sorry, in the dividends that we both get from Klepierre and from Japan, but as you know, the equity account for both so that doesn\u2019t impact, that\u2019s just cash flow, which is important to be hedged on cash flow, don\u2019t get me wrong. But still at the same time, it does as we take our share of the equity income in those businesses. We\u2019re going to have exposure and it is what it is. So I assume that answered your question on that. I mean from an investment point of view book value were essentially hedged, but it\u2019s not going to mean a lot. We\u2019re still going to have some volatility. Not from a cash flow point of view, but from an earnings point of view. That answered your question on that front? Christy McElroy : Yes it does, thanks David. David Simon : Now on the sales, look I think it\u2019s very interesting, because I\u2019ve some commentary around it. We did see a little bit of bit of flattening out in the Florida area kind of first is, as one initial as you know, in terms of devaluation that Latin American customer happened quicker than say the Euro devaluation. We don\u2019t have any earnings impact on that that just might have impacted sales. We also, as Christy, as you know, we are undergoing huge transformational redevelopment in King of Prussia the field, even The Forum Shops were changing a lot of the tenant mix, changing the transition hall from phase 1 to the phase 3 that\u2019s out on this strip, as well as we had this unusual anomaly that we have one retailer that\u2019s in a state that doesn\u2019t pay sales tax, they had an extraordinary amount of sales in 2013, that didn\u2019t repeat because of their own constraints that they post for 2014, that also may have flattened sales in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about it. But I would generally say you put all those things together our portfolio does what $620 a foot, still industry leading given size and scale, we\u2019re adding to the mix, we\u2019re doing a lot of great stuff. So you know how generally I feel about retail sales, okay. And you have seen even with flat retail sales generally over the last two years or three years you\u2019ve seen our comp NOI increases, you know my argument on that. But at least I hope that gives you some color as to how you might think about our number, compared to others out there, but the portfolio is never been stronger or better. Christy McElroy : I appreciate the color. Thank you, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on the trend of the outlet sales. David Simon : They actually were slightly better than the malls, because the malls had this - those kind of two or three things Craig that I just discussed. And our premium outlets on from a both the from a comp point of view had better results than the mall business. Craig Schmidt : Okay, great. And then how far is the ground of development shops at Clearfork from the University Park Village that you just acquired? David Simon : How far a long is it? Craig Schmidt : Well how far are they from each other? David Simon : Well, three miles are so. Three miles Rick half way through? Rick Sokolov : Yes three. David Simon : But its different trade here, but I would say three because there\u2019s a river that runs through it, is one of those things. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then is there any further things that you could do with Costco just given the size of their project beyond The Shops at Clearfork? Rick Sokolov : Hi, Craig its Rick. Right now, we are obviously focused on the first phase. There are a number of elements to that phase. They do have some additional land and depending on how this goes we obviously be open to try and do some additional development. But right now the first phase draws our attention. Craig Schmidt : Great, and then finally just may be this is for Rick. Have you seen what you think might be a change in pace in either store openings or store closings in the Mall space for 2015? Rick Sokolov : Well basically, obviously we\u2019ve had the announcements that everyone has seen. So there is a little more pressure on some closings, but conversely where our record occupancy we\u2019ve just come out of our meetings in December and we got a lot of momentum in the business, because there\u2019s lot of people that are looking for space. And we certainly anticipate we\u2019re going to be able to hold our market share and there is always going to be churning that we\u2019ve had historically. But we\u2019re going to basically to be able to keep things pretty much where they are now in terms of occupancy. And everybody we replace is going to be replaced by someone who is more credit worthy and more productive want to sales per foot base. David Simon : But, Craig, we clearly have at this point in time compared to last year more retailers in bankruptcy. So as you know we\u2019re not sure how many stores we\u2019re going to get back, some we\u2019ve already announced, so it\u2019s really closing stores some in factory been liquidating. So I mean, I don\u2019t - it doesn\u2019t change the fundamentals of our business, but 2015 is going to be a lot of work and really she knows those retailers because depending on when we get it and how much time we have to lease it up, there could be a little gap there. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with MLV. Please proceed. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Paul Morgan : Your same store numbers have been bouncing sort of in the 4% to 6% range over the past three years and you\u2019re lease spreads kind of in the 15% to 20% range. I mean your guidance for same store was 4%. How should I think about that in the context of the past few years where the average is sort of above that? And then kind of related to that where you\u2019re at in terms of occupancy, is that what you think of as maybe approaching a kind of frictional feeling and whether that could constrain your same store growth at all? David Simon : Well, I think what we\u2019ve always tried to be realistic and conservative. I forget Steve, what we\u2019ve announced last year for our comp NOI was, but 4%? Steve Broadwater : 4%. David Simon : So we were fortunate to outperform that. So Paul, we are taking into account. We do have more bankruptcies this year. So I think it\u2019s appropriate for us to be conservative, because as you know, we don\u2019t control, we don\u2019t get the space back, and then we can have downtime, and so on. So if there is a conservative element to what I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little bit because of the just the bankruptcies that we\u2019re having to deal with in 2015 versus 2014. Paul Morgan : Okay, thanks. And then just maybe you think about investments you\u2019ve got $3 billion in developments, redevelopments at what you target as a 9% yield. On acquisitions the cap rates for today are kind of have that for decent properties. And I mean how do you think about that spread both in terms of kind of evaluating acquisitions what makes an acquisition, whether it\u2019s a single asset, or portfolio, or an M&A deal at a much lower yield and then you are getting on your redevelopments? I mean, what makes it compelling from your perspective? David Simon : Well, look I mean there\u2019s nobody been more active in new development and redevelopment than we have been. But it\u2019s not like, oh let\u2019s just do a redevelopment there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s required to get there. And then new development we want to build stock that is at the end of the day going to fit in the certainly in the top half of our portfolio over the long run. So that\u2019s - we have a hell of a portfolio, so that\u2019s hard to achieve. And we\u2019re going reasonably quick when we get to new development and redevelopment. And so at the same time we are not going to buy anything or anybody unless we feel like we can add significant value to it. Now let\u2019s take a couple of recent examples. It\u2019s not bad for my net investment in Kl\u00e9pierre to be up 4x okay, not bad. And we felt like we could add value to that business and thankfully we have. The same thing on the going in yield with the two deals we brought for Glenshire is around five. And we think they are A assets A+ assets and obviously we think we\u2019ll be able to grow those. So that\u2019s a great opportunity. And look at the one thing that I think the market has lost sight of is just everybody\u2019s balance sheet again. It\u2019s like forget about it. Our balance sheet is 5.4 EBITDA multiple, it\u2019s 3.8% interest coverage despite having I still look at those ten and three-quarters that I got outstanding to my team. Right Andy? My team. Andy Juster : Right. David Simon : We still have room to, depending on where rates are, to roll that down and even to make a stronger coverage ratio in balance sheet. So I mean, we\u2019ve always looked at every thing, we\u2019ll look at everything. We\u2019re not going to chase deals, and when it comes to acquisitions unless we feel like we can add value to that property with our, either our infrastructure or leasing know-how development, know-how we just don\u2019t do it. Paul Morgan : That\u2019s your leverage and your balance sheet advantages. I mean do you think of that as an important lever to pull, when you\u2019re looking at bigger deals, capitalizing on that? David Simon : Well, sure. I mean, look it led to - let\u2019s just go back to, \u201809, I mean, the fact of matter is there\u2019s - in the retail real estate sector, there\u2019s nobody, because they were so levered and we did some tough financing including equity, but there is nobody in our sector other than maybe say Taubman, that has out grown whatever dilution. And not only we\u2019re growing it, we just blew it away. Everybody else is still trying to get back to the record FFO per share that they had in 2006, 2007 and the dividend. We are blowing through those dramatically. And what that balance sheet that we had even though, we panic like a few others, allowed us that to be conservative yet, signaled the market that we\u2019re alive and well, blow through the growth that we had, we had a year or two of flatness or step back. But we were able to use that to find good investments that have fueled our growth. So I would hope even in capital rich times we were able to do that as well. But it\u2019s - we\u2019re pretty conservative, we don\u2019t want to blow the balance sheet, we - as you know my background in the real estate world besides being an M&A banker, which was outside of real estate and in all sorts of industries was directly involved in restructuring real estate workouts. And having no fund and we are never going to get there. So we have a great asset, we\u2019ve worked hard to achieve it and it\u2019s a great thing, but you can\u2019t take it for granted. Paul Morgan : Okay, thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. George Auerbach : Thank you. Just a follow-up on Christy\u2019s question, Dave, have you quantified the impact of redevelopment at King of Prussia fields and I forgot the other asset that you mentioned, but just sort of what that\u2019s done to the overall sales growth, trying to think about your portfolio on a more normalized level, adjusting at some of the noise. David Simon : Look, yes, I\u2019m not making to excuses and you know how we\u2019ve all had this discussion about our tenant sales and how I think about it. But if you take these anomalies I\u2019d say generally we\u2019d be around 4%-ish, but again it - our number is our number and you know how management feels about it. I appreciate you may have a different point of view, we have nothing to hide or we had a few anomalies, we\u2019re not making excuses, will accept being dinged on it if you want. But there is a lot of transforming we do have exposure to certain markets within Brazil takes a little breather. And we had this strange thing in a state, I mean, I\u2019m giving you enough, but we tend not to talk about specific retailers. But you could figure out what the state that doesn\u2019t have sales tax. And it is what it is. Same time we do FFO per still into the white paper, the number is the number. We pointed out the $0.04 only because we thought may be the market didn\u2019t know, we had to pickup our share, Klepierre\u2019s transaction cost associated with the bulk tenders, as well as the currency drop pretty precipitously quarter-over-quarter of last year. So we thought it was important do it, but the numbers were not. George Auerbach : Well, no, I was asking because in the Macerich Analyst Day they mentioned that I think there were three big redevelopments they had that lowered their same-store growth on that whole portfolio by 100 basis points. So I know one or two assets can really move the number. That is why I was asking. David Simon : Yes, no, no, it\u2019s a legitimate question. I was talking more about tenants sales on our comp NOI they\u2019re in our number. For all of those that I\u2019ve talked about are in, even though we\u2019re taking some immediate step backs as we redevelop it. So those really aren\u2019t an effect in our comp NOI, at least those assets that I talked about it. George Auerbach : Great and I guess just a last one from me, you and the Board, have increased the dividend pretty meaningfully over the last couple of quarters at a pace above FFO growth. I guess as the redevelopment spends kind of may be tapers off into 2015 and 2016 should we anticipate that the dividend growth will continue to outpace FFO or AFFO growth for the foreseeable future? Andy Juster : Yes, we\u2019ve got taxable incomes got a lot of variability, we are - as you know we paid out 100% of our taxable income last year. And I did underline, I hope you saw that at least $560, I will underline that that\u2019s at least $560 or so. The answer is our taxable income is growing significantly as our earnings are and so it\u2019s very conceivable that that could be an outcome of that. George Auerbach : Great, thank you. Andy Juster : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Tom Ward : Hello. Operator : Mr. Sakwa, your line is open. Your phone maybe muted. Tom Ward : Hello, [indiscernible] Operator : We\u2019ll move the next question. Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi, good morning David. David Simon : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, and it is, I know you\u2019re not commenting on the Macerich. But it is interesting the market is cheering you guys and your stocks out performance. So clearly the market seems to be suggesting that it wants something to happen. Just as far as Macerich in the guidance, Andy, are you saying there\u2019s no impact the way you are accounting for, there\u2019s no impact to the 2015 numbers, or we should be picking up something? Andy Juster : No impact. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, okay. And then, hi David. Steve Broadwater : Let me do clarify that, I mean, we - let me just clarify that, they do pay us a dividend, so we do have the dividend income in our numbers. Okay. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Andy Juster : But not, but obviously it\u2019s the movement up and down goes in the comprehensive income or loss, in this case its income, because its up. Yes, but that\u2019s not an FFO number, so and the only thing in our FFO guidance is their dividend have income. Okay, Alex. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, yes, yes, that\u2019s right. I just want to make sure that that\u2019s the way you are accounting for it. Just the next thing David, is right after the world\u2019s woke up to lower oil after Thanksgiving, you announced two projects down in oil country. So just sort of curious what you guys have, obviously tenant demand was unaffected by it. So should we just take away from this that the retailers are un-faced by the drop in oil, and they just see continued strong sales down in those markets, or is your view that may be some of the tenants who initially indicated that they would be in interested in both of these projects, may start to have second thoughts? David Simon : Well, Houston Galleria is been under construction for quite some sometime, well over a year or so. But Texas itself is so diversified than it used to be 20 plus years ago, 20 plus years ago with oil. And basically real estate, today its tech, Houston is very diversified obviously oil and gas, is important but it\u2019s got the medical focus on the universities and Dallas Fort work, that\u2019s less and less oil and gas completely, that\u2019s more. So the answer is, we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll have the any impact. Fort Worth we\u2019re excited about because Neiman Marcus is obviously huge in that area, relocating for one mall for this to be their flagship store in Fort Worth. And we think the demand for that is great, no issues in Houston Galleria which one of the top five centers in the country. And so when you put it all together it\u2019s really long run was no issue at all. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, and I guess same applies to Tulsa? David Simon : True, yes. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then final question is, as you guys start to do more of these mix use or added density to some of the projects, some of your malls, how do you underwrite the projects as, yes, there is a return from obviously adding apartments or adding hotels and then there is hopefully the additional return of just added traffic to the mall that allows you to drive higher NOI and cash flows. So if we think about the returns as you guys pencil out densifying some of the sites, how should we think about the incremental return from just boosting NOI versus just adding an additional use to a center? Rick Sokolov : Hi, this is Rick, basically when we add an apartment or a hotel those stand on their own. It is a separate analysis. If there is some incremental benefit great, but we do not theoretically create any kind of incremental return based on adding more match or densifying in assets. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So, Rick, is there like an incremental that we can expect or you guys expect or you don\u2019t underwrite but any way, shape or form? Rick Sokolov : We do not underwrite that. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. David Simon : None. Zero. Don\u2019t give my guys any ideas. Alexander Goldfarb : To sandbag the numbers? Never would cross our minds. David Simon : No, don\u2019t give that, no, no, no don\u2019t give my development guys, when they come in and they want the project approved don\u2019t assume, they\u2019ll come in and say, it\u2019s going to do this to the mall, we should improve that, forget it. It doesn\u2019t happen that way. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thanks a lot. David Simon : Yes, no worries. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed. Carol Kemple : Good morning. David Simon : How are you? Carol Kemple : Fine, have you all noticed any change within the last three months in your conversations with Sears and JCPenney\u2019s about buying some of the boxes back? David Simon : No. Carol Kemple : Okay. And then are there any new concepts that are coming into your malls or outlet centers that you are excited about that you can share? David Simon : Well, here we go again, alright. So Rick, this is Rick. You love this part. So Rick, let her go. Okay, here we go. Here is a list. Rick Sokolov : Unleashing the fear, in the Outlet sector every literally every month we\u2019re finding more and more retailers that understand that this is a very valuable and profitable distribution channel. And so Jeff, Alice and Olivia, Citizens Watch, Jonathan Adler, [indiscernible] literally we could go on, but the answer is there\u2019s a great deal of new entrants into the outlet sector. Into the mall sector we\u2019re Accolade and David T. We\u2019re doing NYX as a new concept from L\u2019Oreal. And UNIQLO is very actively looking. And interestingly it\u2019s is lost in the sauce, but L Brands is dramatically growing pink and Victoria\u2019s Secret. So there is a lot of very good dynamic demand for our properties. Carol Kemple : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed. Omotayo Okusanya : Hi yes, good morning, everyone. David Simon : Good morning. Omotayo Okusanya : I would like to kind of go back to the 2015 guidance and, again, the point of guidance relative to where consensus is. It sounds, based on your comments that\u2019s about 1% of earnings which is about $0.09 to $0.10 that is FX related. But I\u2019m wondering what else is in guidance that maybe we are not - maybe the Street is not fully appreciating which is why our numbers seem a little bit high? Is it, again, some of the working through of some of the retail bankruptcies that have happened that may\u2026 Andy Juster : Yes, I think I don\u2019t know what your comp NOI is and I also think a lot of it has to do in maybe how you are factoring in our development spend, because most of 2015 and a lot of 2016 is backend weighted. So we\u2019ve got our share around 2.1. So I mean that that would be our only other gas, but I\u2019m sure Tom can walk you through how you are doing. But maybe you have a little bit higher comp NOI. I mentioned we are conservative on that number, because we are looking at a little bit higher bankruptcies than we look at last year. We obviously always try to do better, but our development spend tends to be back-end weighted, depending on how you factor that in and then obviously the currency delta from the Yen and the Euro is around $0.10 from 2014 to 2015. So you added up and, it is what it is. Omotayo Okusanya : Got it. Could you just talk about in 2015 guidance what average occupancies baked into those numbers? Andy Juster : Pretty consistent with what our 2014 showed. Omotayo Okusanya : Great, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in the supplemental when we just take a look at the development page, the Outlet - the yield on the Outlet business, on the Outlet development is up to 11% versus 9% previously. Is that just a mix change? David Simon : Yes, Montreal was little lower yield and Tampa is much higher. Tampa we think will be a great outlet center. One of the - at the end of day, one of the leading outlet centers in the country, and it absolutely is that mix change. Omotayo Okusanya : Great. And then lastly with Jersey Gardens, just curious what your thoughts are in regards to what NOI growth could look like once rents start to reset for a lot of the tenants? Rick Sokolov : What we have, this is Rick, we have already set the base line overall in our NOI growth, and Jersey Gardens should be in excess of that once we start doing what we think can be done there and as David said, they did a great job before, we\u2019re just now taking it to the next level and allocating space and bringing in incremental more productive tenants, that\u2019s going to drive rent and sales. Omotayo Okusanya : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you gentlemen. David Simon : Yes, no worries. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Vincent Chao : Hey, everyone. Just maybe thinking about the comp NOI guidance slightly differently. Just as we think about the 4% versus the 5.1% and also in light of the comments about higher levels of bankruptcies. I guess what would - and how much of the higher level of bankruptcies is sort of the difference between the 5.1% and the 4%? Andy Juster : Well, look again that we\u2019re factoring that in. And like I said last year we had - our business has certain level of volatility to it, not a lot, because we\u2019ll have to go sell our products at the start of every year like a lot other companies. So because we have mostly contractual rents, the big variability is on anticipated bankruptcy, the timing of which that occurs, when we\u2019d get it and then how long it takes us to lease it up. So and I said last year, Steve Broadwater, we projected, what was our NOI projection? Steve Broadwater : 4%. Andy Juster : 4% we got 5.1%. So again we\u2019re factor in that in, we\u2019ll see obviously, we\u2019ve got variability to some extent, marginally on expenses. And we have certain variability on overage rent but we have long history of kind of modeling that, but it does create some variability. We also have a lot of redevelopment work where we are not necessarily taking out a comp. The big projects like Roswell Field and King of Prussia, and those, where we\u2019re moving a lot of tenants around and the forum shops. We\u2019ve got Copley, I think Copley, if I remember from our budget sessions is going down $2 million this year really pissed me of in our budget meeting, because we\u2019re retaining into a better group. But that\u2019s the nature, you got a re-tenant, you got to improve the mix, when you\u2019re bring in a better tenant they have a longer build out, all of that takes time. So we hope to do better, it\u2019s not too shabby, we move on. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks. And then just one other question on the FX, I apologize if I missed it. The $0.10 headwind, what euro rate and yen rate is that based on? Steve Broadwater : It\u2019s based upon our view of it over period of time. But this is really in comparison to 2014. Vincent Chao : Okay, thank you. Steve Broadwater : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Haendel St Juste : Good morning. Rick Sokolov : How are you doing? Haendel St Juste : So a few questions for you. First, David, on Kl\u00e9pierre, I was curious if you could help give us a broad sense of the magnitude of upside you think you might have there perhaps in terms of percentage of G&A expense, portfolio upgrading, closing evaluation gap with Univie [ph], just curious for your thoughts there. David Simon : Well, its better that the management team, there does there. But I will say generally just for my perspective where they\u2019ve done a really good job over the last couple of years with our strategic help to continue to move in the right direction, smaller - reduce the smaller assets, focus more on the bigger ones, upgrade the marketing tenant mix, et cetera. I think Corio has got a better portfolio than a lot of people think. The integration there is a little bit complicated than it is say in the U.S. when it comes to integration because of the rules out there. I\u2019m going to grieve all the technicalities about it, but I think net, net over a period of time, there is great upside in running a better more efficient company with after the Corio mergers completed. And I would expect that that gap would continue to narrow, which it has dramatically, but we\u2019ll continue to narrow. And unlike I said I mean I\u2019m not. The most important thing this is great, but are you making money. Our net invest is up $850 million in two years, two and a half years and maybe its three years - okay, so, I\u2019m sorry, its three years. So - and I felt that they\u2019ve got upside to move forward. Haendel St Juste : I appreciate that. And following-up on I guess some of the earlier stronger dollar questions clearly makes your purchasing power better overseas. I am wondering is that perhaps might make you more perhaps aggressively inclined on expanding your international portfolio? David Simon : We only want to do it if we think we can make money. So I have no desire to expand international as we think it\u2019s a profit opportunity for us. Haendel St Juste : Fair enough. And then last one. Wondering how much of your energy costs are variable, just trying to get a sense of if there could be a positive impact to margins. Andy Juster : Not really because we tend to charge that to the tenants. And so we just pass on that savings to them. To some extent, the share that we pay for ourselves will have an added benefit. It\u2019s not overly material. Haendel St Juste : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. So just turning to your expenses, if I look at the trend just in operating expenses as a percent of your revenue has been trending down for a very long time which has helped obviously your expense recoveries and whatnot. And just curious is this a trend - I mean it is hard to imagine it going more favorable towards - versus the perhaps run rate. But given like rising expenses and rising taxes do we - where do you think this settles out? And how does that impact your expense recoveries going forward and maybe should we expect some kind of reversion to the mean at one point? David Simon : No, I think, we\u2019re always trying to improve our operating margins. So every once in a while there will be modest changes from year-to-year. Obviously in 2009 recession we took a very tough year that, now we\u2019re still getting the comp NOI growth even though we\u2019re less focused on that like we were in 2009, I shouldn\u2019t say less focus, but we\u2019re not as - we\u2019re not trying to wring every nickel out of it. We also have marketing expenses, customer relations - consumer relations expenses that we\u2019re focused on doing. So there will be year-to-year variability to it, but we\u2019re still trying to improve it. Ki Bin Kim : So, if I - maybe I can ask it in a different way. For 2014 you ended with about 32%-33% operating expenses as a percent of rents. In your guidance are you implicitly modeling that stays flat or improves or reverts back? David Simon : Relatively the same. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. David Simon : Relatively flat. Ki Bin Kim : And just last question. How do you compare the quality of - and I know there is different regions, but Klepierre with Corio versus a Macerich? How would you describe the quality between those two portfolios? David Simon : Well, that\u2019s a good one. I mean, I would say it\u2019s hard to necessarily compare one to the next. In Europe, the supply and demand is reasonably favorable, but on the other hand, the U.S. is really caught up on that front because there has been as we all know no new really full price development for number of years. So the occupancy costs are a little higher in Europe than they are - for a retailer than they are in the U.S. But I don\u2019t know, I have to get that little bit more thought. I don\u2019t necessarily - I look at more in that specific market as opposed to one country to another country. It\u2019s a little tougher comparison to do, but let me give us some thought. Ki Bin Kim : Yes, I mean so the reason I ask that is when you have your choices of capital - where to deploy capital and you have Macerich trading at 4.5%, and I know if you take it further there is probably some operating margin you can pull out of it if you did take down the whole portfolio. And when I compare to maybe a Klepierre with Corio on quality, with that portfolio trading at maybe a 5% cap rate - and this is just rough math, by the way - or higher, how do you make that relative comparison in terms of where to deploy that capital? David Simon : I mean the most important thing as you got a risk adjustment and you don\u2019t - in the U.S., you don\u2019t have currency risk. So as you can see, no one is really happy about our currency risk today. So I mean, I don\u2019t - I\u2019m not overly worried about it, but it is we do have a little bit of risk. The U.S. is a safer - we should give a higher return when we go outside of our natural boarders. That is slightly harder to underwrite. It is a little more complex. There are more rules and regulations to do what you want. Even though we\u2019ve had a profound impact on Kl\u00e9pierre, we know U.S. investing better than we know outside U.S. investing. So you certainly would want a higher return anywhere outside the U.S. for those and other reasons. So in your question, you got a factor that into it. The rates there - I mean the rates there really, really attracted. So, if you can take into account the higher risk adjusted rate of return, you may have better, better investment opportunity. But at this point, we don\u2019t look at mutually exclusive : the U.S. or Europe or Asia. We like to look at each individual idea, more investment on its own and then stress test with our own corporate opportunities and our own internal opportunities and see what it means for the balance sheet and our management bandwidth. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Michael Mueller : Hi, just a quick one. What sort of yield are you looking at for the Clearfork development? And is there any update on any thoughts on plans for the Oyster Bay site? David Simon : Clearfork will be - it\u2019s not had been started construction, but we will outline that once we put it into service. So it\u2019s not in our 8-K, yet, because we haven\u2019t actually started construction. We\u2019re getting - it\u2019s going to happen, but for finalizing our cost numbers and the leasing plan and all of that and should start in the next two months or so. So there is some great thing going on in the site now, but - so we\u2019ll let you know on that, but it will be attractive value enhancing return. And your Oyster Bay; Oyster Bay, I think will be a very active year. We have an unbelievable plan and vision of what we want to do with the properties. We\u2019re working now with the various town and the various agencies about going through the approval process. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see more of that this year as it comes out, but we\u2019ve actually developed the plan, a very unique lifestyle mixed use center that we think we\u2019ll have great appeal to ask financially as well as that all of the community groups there. Michael Mueller : Okay, great. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed. Linda Tsai : Hi. How would you characterize holiday sales overall? Does the outcome say much to you about the underlying strength of the economy? And then also in the context of recent store closure announcements, I realized a lot of these retailers were already struggling, but how much of an impact did the holiday season have or were they likely to close anyways in your view? David Simon : I think on the later question, the arch of the retailers that have already announced bankruptcy or closings was really beyond a given quarter at a given results in the holiday. They have been struggling for an extended period of time. In terms of the holiday sales, in some places they were stronger, some - the stronger retailers reported better sales, but there were a larger percentage that were weaker. But overall is the economy stronger, is the lower oil and gas prices putting some incremental disposable money into the consumer\u2019s pocket, it is. Confidence is up. So overall, the macro factors are encouraging. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Caitlin Burrows : Hi I guess, good afternoon. Now this is getting a little long, so I\u2019ll try to be quick. If you could just comment on your capacity and interest in issuing more Euro denominated debt [indiscernible] is at 0.3%. David Simon : Yes, good question, I think the answer is we\u2019re going to seriously consider it, right Andy. Andy Juster : Yes, absolutely, we always look at both currencies. Right now, we could issue 10 year Euro debt at under 1.5%, significantly under. So that\u2019s something we\u2019ll look at. And the basis play has become a lot more favorable in the last couple of months. Caitlin Burrows : Okay, great, thanks. And then also just acknowledging that you\u2019ve already spun off your lower tier [indiscernible] within the portfolio you have now. Could you just describe any differences between tenant productivity and your top-tier versus lower-tier centers and also tenant interest? David Simon : Within our - the existing SPG portfolio after spend? Caitlin Burrows : That\u2019s correct. David Simon : I would say not dramatically different in terms of tenant demand. I mean, sure the top 20 centers always are going to have somewhat more demand than the next 20, but generally, nothing no great variation there. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Great thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Rich Moore : Hey, guys good afternoon. I wanted to just make sure I understood - the redevelopment pipeline you guys have right now is pretty much completed in 2015 and 2016. But then as you look forward, what kind of annual spend in redevelopment do you think you\u2019ll have as you go out to 2017, 2018, et cetera? David Simon : Well, Rich the 2.1% is directly from our 8-K and that is only projects that are actually started and then corporately approved through our approval process. So for instance, it doesn\u2019t include Clearfork yet, it doesn\u2019t include Oyster Bay, it doesn\u2019t include Copley, it doesn\u2019t include the whole host of other deals. So the number that we\u2019ve kind of said generally was around $1 billion a year. For the foreseeable future, and I still, Rich, would generally say that\u2019s probably a pretty good number. Rich Moore : Okay, good. So you feel comfortable with that. That is great. Thank you. And then I also wanted to ask usually early in the year, maybe by the middle of the year, you\u2019ve pretty much covered a lot of the leasing, Rick, that is going to happen for the year. So 2015 by middle of the year would pretty much be handled. And I am curious with occupancy as high as it is, is that moving up? I mean are you done with more leasing at this point in the year for 2015 than you might normally be? Rick Sokolov : We are ahead this year over last year. We\u2019re about 65% through our renewals in 2015. And we\u2019ve obviously made a major focus on getting as far out ahead of it as we can. So we can be responsive. And because our occupancy is higher, those tenants that are looking for space understand that if they don\u2019t commit someone else is going to get the space. So that obviously is also encouraging people to accelerate there, just as you making as well. Rich Moore : Okay, good, got you. So normally this time of year you would be maybe half done, something like that or less? Rick Sokolov : Yes. Rich Moore : Okay. Good thank you guys. David Simon : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott ODonnell with MetLife. Please proceed. Scott ODonnell : Yes, hi, good afternoon and I\u2019ve got a quick question. You guys have been a great steward of the balance sheet for bondholders. I guess I have to ask the question, why the commercial paper program? How does that make sense from a strategic standpoint? And can you explain the strategy around exposing yourself to the short-term money markets? David Simon : Well, Scott we go back, it\u2019s handy. We go back for long time. As you know we\u2019ve got a 70 billion equity market cap, it\u2019s less than 1% of our total market cap and it helps us. One of the things we\u2019re looking at is as we significantly want to roll down our debt cost we have a huge opportunity over the next two years as our average interest rate is about 5.65% on the $5 billion of debt it comes to. It allows us to look at potentially one prepaying some of our secure debt where we can borrow at was at 15 basis points to 16 basis points and there is absolutely no risk. It also diversifies our investor base. We\u2019ve had significant strong investors and there is really no risk because it is like in the olden days, as you know, when we used to have the banks fit on a competitive bid line now we just replace that with as you know commercial paper. And the regulations in the market is far, far different than it was five, ten years ago. So we had no problem. We started in October, there were some volatile market s. We had absolutely no problem rolling over any of our, if you would, euro paper or our USD paper and it\u2019s again something in a small way that we\u2019re going to continue to do and to be proactive and opportunistic. Scott ODonnell : So I get that. So you are viewing it more from a transactional flexibility standpoint rather than a strategic part of your capital structure because I think we have talked over the years about this. You guys have long-term assets and you tend to want to fund them long-term, right? Rick Sokolov : And yes, absolutely and that\u2019s why we significantly increased our average weighted term as we reduced the rate and that will continue to be the case. David Simon : Okay. Scott ODonnell : Thank you. David Simon : I think any other questions operator? Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I would now\u2026 David Simon : Thank you, Ma\u2019am.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Okay. Good morning. We had a strong start to 2015. As you know, we closed on the acquisition of Jersey Gardens and University Park Village, two great properties that we are excited to have in our portfolio. We created two joint ventures with two of our longstanding retail partners, one with Hudson's Bay Company and the other with Sears Holdings which will serve as additional avenues for growth. And of course we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. As you know, results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.28 per share, exceeding once again the First Call consensus by $0.03. And that was achieved even though we had a decrease of approximately $0.03 for the quarter due to the strong dollar against the euro and the yen. And on a comparable basis excluding the operating results from WPG properties in the prior year period. Our FFO per share increased 6.5% or $0.14 even with the currency devaluation. Let me turn to our operating metrics, cash flow. Occupancy was 95.8%, leasing activity remains strong and healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $11.19 per square foot, an increase of 18.9%. Now let\u2019s talk about comp NOI. Comp NOI increased 3.5% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to an increase of 5.3% in the first quarter of 2014. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our domestic property NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation. And very importantly with respect to this quarter, our comp NOI in the first quarter was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points, due to a significant overage retroactive billing within the mills in the first quarter of 2014 and if you remember, we put in the mills in terms of our comp NOI beginning last year. If you wanted to understand our comp NOI on the outlets and the malls it\u2019s approximately 4%, and right on our budget. Total sales across our portfolio increased 2% in the first quarter, compared to the first quarter of last year and I will also point out there was a recent pitch affirming our A rating. They did a report that I would suggest at the Analytic community review just to put in the back of your mind on our comp NOI growth. We have exceeded our peers by an average of 240 basis points from the period of time of 2005 to 2014. I thought that was interesting reading, in any event let\u2019s go to construction. We continue new premium outlets in Gloucester, which will serve the South Jersey in Philadelphia areas and new centers in Tampa and Tucson, as well as our designer outlet in Vancouver. All our great high quality major markets and each is scheduled to open later this year. We are slated to begin construction on as many as three additional domestic premium outlets in 2015, as well as three international outlets in 2015 for a total of six. We are beginning side work shortly at the shops at Clearfork, which as you know is our new full price development in Ft. Worth anchored by Neiman. We plan on opening that in early 2017. Yesterday, we were excited to announce our partnership with Swire and the Whitman family for the retail component of Brickell City Centre, which is anchored by Saks. We look forward to contributing our leasing and management expertise to this signature project, which includes a significant residential component and that will open in the fall of 2016 and on Oyster Bay, which we are renaming Syosset Park. We have began the approval process for what will be a unique mixed use life style center with retail office hotel park for the families of the Oyster Bay area and residential components. Initial feedback on our plan has been positive. We expect the process to go well. On the redevelopment and expansion we\u2019ve got 24 properties across our three platforms in the U.S. and Asia for a total commitment of $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed a 265,000 square foot expansion at Yeoju Premium Outlets in Seoul and recently completed a 136,000 square foot expansion of Shisui Premium Outlets in Tokyo, both off to great starts; and let\u2019s not forget construction continues on major re-development expansion projects at some of our most productive malls, all under construction including, but not limited to Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford Shopping Center, King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our premium outlets in Woodbury, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, and Chicago, all under construction, all bringing significant amount of new square footage for 2016 and over the next 18 months. Kl\u00e9pierre, we were pleased to have played the key role in Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s acquisition of Corio, which became effective at the end of March, creating the leading pure-play retail property company in Continental Europe. We now have a \u20ac21 billion portfolio in 16 countries. And to remind the investment community, this was a \u20ac7.4 billion M&A transaction. We are pleased to see the rebound in the European shopper. Kl\u00e9pierre will report the results next week and we expect a higher and stronger growth portfolio given the acquisition. Capital markets, we expanded our $2 billion revolving credit facility to $2.75 billion and extended its maturity to 2020. Our current liquidity, including revolvers and cash on hands is over $6 billion. Our industry leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us from our peer group. As you know, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. We have not yet repurchased any shares as a result of our trading window blackout due to earnings and the timing of our buyback announcement. And proudly, we are proud to announce yet another dividend increase of $1.50, which is a year-over-year increase of 15% and a 7% increase from the first quarter of 2015. Again, nobody has got our dividend growth. We will pay at least $5.90, an increase of nearly, as I said, 15% from last year. So let me turn to guidance. We\u2019ve increased our guidance based on our view of the year, again, from $9.65 to $9.75, again, nobody in our peer group has the kind of growth that we have. And we continue to feel very comfortable, as I mentioned to you, on the comp NOI growth of 4% for the year for malls, Premium Outlets and Mills. And we are ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed. Michael Bilerman : Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David Simon : How are you doing? Michael Bilerman : Great. So, David, I was curious as to how you think about your stake in Macerich at this point. You sort of view it as a $470 million mall, that\u2019s given you a 3% yield, you think it is potentially worth $570, or do you sort of view it as worth $470 million, you bought it for $370 million, you have a $100 million and sort of take that money and go home? David Simon : Well, Michael, frankly, since we were not able to engage with Macerich, even though we tried very hard to, as you know, we put what I felt was a unbelievable hell of an offer on the table and I, obviously, tried very hard to engage. We have been so busy between the Sears and the HBC, finishing Brickell, doing Clearfork, making sure our redevelopment is on time and on budget. The three new deals that we have internationally, I have really not had the luxury of figuring out what I\u2019m going to do with that stake. So at this point, I can\u2019t really answer your question, but at some point, I will address it in the near future. But we had just been too busy running the business, producing very good strong results, raising the dividend, doing the buyback, doing all the redevelopment, all the new ventures that I haven\u2019t really sat down and figure out what to do next. I\u2019m open to your ideas if you have any though. Michael Bilerman : Yeah. I don\u2019t think I should publicly say that on a call. In terms of Europe and you talked about the Kl\u00e9pierre Corio transaction and being instrumental in that deal, as you think about potentially putting additional to Europe when you originally made the state, the euro was about EUR 1.30, you are under EUR 1.10 today, you obviously have some hedge because you have some euro denominated debt. But I am just curious as you think about potentially taking your stake backup to a 30% level, if that\u2019s in the cards and putting capital out given where the euro is and how you sort of think about that. David Simon : Well, that kind of opportunity is always on the table. I will say that, we are up a EUR 1.4 billion in our investment. Guys, right? Andrew Juster : Yeah. David Simon : So that\u2019s not too shabby of a trade if I can quote out on Sandler who is one of my heroes. I quoted him last year, not last year but in 2013 annual letter, but all you talk about is Steve Ross letter, he haven\u2019t mentioned mine but I thought I had a pretty good line in there. I mentioned in our call I think people who site, we did helped engineer a $7.4 billion European merger. That again is not to \u2013 don\u2019t underestimate the fact and the role that I played \u2013 we played in putting together those two companies that was a EUR7.4 billion investment. And as you know that the capital going towards Europe and the timing of that deal I think is going to be very attractive for us in the long run. So I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with my investment, but we will just see how that evolves. There were couple other large shareholders, they certainly haven\u2019t indicated to me anytime that they\u2019re going to \u2013 that they\u2019re looking to get out. I think they are very pleased with what those transpired since our involvement over the last three years. Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning, David. It\u2019s Christy here. You\u2019ve talked often about your larger regional model re-development and expansion projects, but I am wondering with the new Hudson's Bay and Sears JVs and this may be more or so with the Sears boxes. But is your new control over [indiscernible] boxes unlock any future potential major redevelopment projects in any of your centers or is it too early to tell? And maybe you could just provide some general comments on the future opportunities for investments that could arise from these JV? David Simon : Well, I think the JV with Sears clearly is all about redeveloping those boxes with Sears potentially as taking some of that space and in some cases maybe not. And as also part of that deal, we bought the Plaza store which is a fantastic mall, does I don\u2019t know 750 a day of food. It got a lot of demand. So that also gives us the ability to look at expanding that mall. So the answer, I don\u2019t want to put a number on it Christy but I would definitely say that it\u2019s all about retaining with Sears maybe downsizing their stores and then into Plaza certainly \u2013 there is a major expansion in the works there that we are going to move very, very fast on. And that will, the Plaza just is a general scope, will get couple of hundred million bucks at the end of the day. So all of that was part of about \u2013 all of that was done in the mind to faster redevelopment for sure. Christy McElroy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. This is something related to Christy\u2019s last question. There seems to be more churning in both the mall, especially in the mall anchor space. I am just wondering from Simon\u2019s mall portfolio perspective, is that actually an opportunity for you, something you actually would welcome just given your dominant portfolio and opportunities at distance you from your peers? David Simon : I would say we have \u2013 we don\u2019t use the word dominant here. We have a very high quality portfolio that\u2019s produced outsize comp NOI growth with our peer over and I know we get focused on a quarter here, quarter there, but if you look over any kind of extended period of time we\u2019ve clearly outperformed our peer group. I would say there is, there is not a lot of churning in the department store world, I think we have brick one, empty box out of how many Rick? Richard Sokolov : 450 onwards. David Simon : Richard Sokolov : It\u2019s in [indiscernible]. David Simon : Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah that\u2019s a tough one. But in any event like in Riverside, we got the Saks building back we actually just approved internally yesterday a whole redevelopment of that Box, so we were down to one box, but clearly on the specialty side we did lose a handful of retailers and I think at the end of the day there will be an opportunity from it obviously we are focused on releasing it on that space, but we are going to put in better retailers and as you know, I mean the retail business like any business in today\u2019s environment is Darwinian and the retailers that are going away are relatively weaker ones. There is a whole host of stronger ones in the pipeline that we would expect to be able to add excitement to our properties and ultimately increase our cash flow from their participation in our building. So, that\u2019s the nature of our business. As you know Craig, we like showing the slide about the top 10 retailers at 93, we went public till today, it is a little more going on today then maybe it was a year or two ago, but nothing that we are overly concerned about and we are poised to do the work necessary to make these properties better and obviously having a high quality portfolio like we do will make it happen. Craig Schmidt : Okay and then just beside your significant redevelopment pipeline efforts. Are there any emerging areas or real estate formats that you are looking to down the road that could be in the area of growth for Simon? David Simon : Like other users or\u2026? Craig Schmidt : I mean obviously you haven\u2019t been that interested in highs steel, but is there, I mean just thinking you know the malls is mature business at some point the opportunities for premium outlet slow and then what are you seeing maybe five years down the road that might be an opportunity to grow? David Simon : Well, look we have always looked. I think the Hudson Bay joint venture is going to give us another avenue of gross in that whole single credit tenant kind of business, both internationally in the U.S. you know street retail potentially out of that I don\u2019t know, you know the values there are pretty salty when the deals that we have seen. So, you know I think Craig, we\u2019ve always been creative in trying to find other areas, it will focus around retail real estate, but we are not concerned not at all about not being able to find avenues of growth, but clearly we still got a big pipeline of redevelopment. The outlet business, our outlet business is very strong. So, we posted great comp NOI numbers this quarter. Sales were very strong. So, we see that growth continuing and then with the redevelopment that we are doing at some of our iconic mall properties, again these aren\u2019t pipe dreams. They are \u2013 Houston Galleria, Roosevelt Field, Stanford Galleria, Del Amo, King of Prussia I mean this stuff is, maybe we should put on our website to show you the steel, but this stuff is all happening. So, we got plenty to say grace over right now. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys. Just a first question on \u2013 back on Macerich. What were the pursuit costs related there? And I guess where do they fall in your Q1 numbers? David Simon : It\u2019s in other expense and they are done and we have no more. Jeff Donnelly : Are you able to give an estimate or? David Simon : Immaterial. I mean, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t want to \u2013 it basic \u2013 immaterial. We do a lot of this in-house, you are looking at them. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. David Simon : For better or worse, okay? Jeff Donnelly : And you work cheaply. So\u2026 David Simon : Some may argue that. But the point is, for better or worse, you are looking at the M&A guide here, okay? Jeff Donnelly : Okay. Maybe to switch gears, I\u2019m just curious on occupancy. I think Q1 occupancy was down a little bit year-over-year; and maybe I missed it in your remarks, but is that just a return to a more normal \u2013 what I will call sort of pullback post-holiday, or is there something else going on there? David Simon : Well, I would say, Jeff, we clearly \u2013 normally, we are always going to close 60 bps to 80 bps from the seasonality part of our business, right? We had more than that this time and that\u2019s all related to, I\u2019d say, another 50 bps or so, all related to bankruptcies. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. David Simon : And, again, we had planned that, that\u2019s why we were cautious on our comp NOI growth, so there is no surprise there. Cautious being \u2013 I\u2019d argue 4% is not \u2013 is pretty significant when I look at other categories, I look at office, I look at industrial, I look at across the platform, 4% ain\u2019t too bad. But nevertheless, it is a little bit lower and it was all because we were planning the guys that were on the ropes. And the guys that were on the ropes ended up on the mat, so to speak. In the spirit of the upcoming Pacquiao/Mayweather fight, okay? Jeff Donnelly : Okay. David Simon : They ended up on the mat. Rick Sokolov : The only thing I would say, Jeff, is we expect that occupancy to go up as we move through the year and get some of that space redeployed, which we\u2019re in the process of doing right now. Jeff Donnelly : Yes, because I think at the end of the fourth quarter you guys were looking for sort of flat occupancy by year end. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was still the case. Rick Sokolov : Yeah. David Simon : Yeah, look, could we be a few basis points below it? Sure. But, again, you also have to factor in we\u2019ve got a lot of redevelopment going on. So our portfolio is in a pretty significant \u2013 undergoing a pretty significant activities going on. So it will be very close to that number. Jeff Donnelly : I saw that David Contis was working on converting temporary space to permanent space. How much do you guys have in the way of short-term tenancy today, and how does that compare to history? David Simon : It\u2019s been going down pretty significantly. I\u2019m going to say, again, we don\u2019t \u2013 in our occupancy, we only include folks that have a lease of a year in. So, now we do \u2013 sometimes we do year-to-year leases because we are looking for a better group, but that number has been \u2013 is high. The year-to-year guys have been as high as the mid-5%s, we are down about 4% now, Jeff, roughly, rough numbers, right, guys? Rick Sokolov : Yeah. David Simon : Getting close, we will get there. Jeff Donnelly : And just the last question or two is on WP Glimcher. Is there a set date when you expect that arrangement on providing services to end? David Simon : May 16th is the end of that right, Rick? Rick Sokolov : May 2016 David Simon : Yeah. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. Then on Oyster Bay, how close are you guys \u2013 David Simon : Let me clarify May 2016, not May 16th. Okay? Jeff Donnelly : Right, right. And just on Oyster Bay, how close are you guys to getting the necessary approvals to move ahead there? David Simon : Look it is a process; I think by the end of this year, we will be in very good shape. But we have a lot \u2013 there is a lot to go through. So we are shooting the next six months or so are going to be very important but that\u2019s how we are thinking about the timing. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. Thanks guys. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed. Ross Nussbaum : Hey, guys. Good morning. David Simon : How are you? Ross Nussbaum : David, let me first ask in stock buyback. Do you intend to actually buyback any stock around the current levels or was it put in place as a placeholder or was it a statement to Macerich a little of everything. David Simon : Well, I mean I think the REIT market I would say this obviously I am not going to tell you when or how we\u2019re going to buy stock back, but I would say we wouldn\u2019t have announced it once we were serious about it. We couldn\u2019t buy any stock back because we were in our blackout period when the announcement came. And as I look at other companies and their valuation and I look at ours, and our growth prospects and our track record, I continue to think we are extremely well positioned. As I look at history year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter and all that we\u2019ve got going on, look at our valuation compared to our peer group and I feel very comfortable that we are a very strong and good investment. Now with the added volatility in the REIT sector, we want to be able to take advantage of that volatility. So I think you will see us at the appropriate times of volatility and no statement had nothing to do with Macerich obviously had that deal gone forward maybe the capital would have been allotted differently, but I look at our growth profile, I look at the history of our results, I look at our balance sheet, I look at the peer group, I look at revaluations generally and I think I can\u2019t pick a better investment than ours as we look forward. So we will take advantage of volatility. We\u2019ll do this opportunistically and you will see us in the market at the appropriate times. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. Appreciate that. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in the department store industry right now? And I know you\u2019ve got different motivating factors behind what happened with Hudson\u2019s Bay and with what is going on with Sears. I guess a couple of questions. One is, did you discuss with Sears or do they want to sell you more than what you actually bought? I am curious what you think of their, I\u2019ll call it spin rights offering and do you see other department store companies also transacting with their real estate any time soon? David Simon : Well, look I would say that Sears and us got comfortable with the portfolio. It wasn\u2019t dramatically different from the beginning to where we ended up. And I think it\u2019s good to have that kind of relationship. I think it can grow overtime. I think they have valuable real estate and we see [indiscernible] has been able to know as a company we wouldn\u2019t invest in it less we saw that going forward. And frankly, Hudson\u2019s Bay I think they \u2013 I really like their management team. I really like that real estate being a partner with them and their real estate and looking for future growth opportunities, [indiscernible] and other avenue of growth. So I see that as another very good opportunity. Could other retailers take advantage of their inherent real estate value? Sure, but if they do it to the extent or they\u2019ve got a balloon if they squeeze one end too high, you got to be very careful on how they do it. But if they\u2019re thoughtful about how they want to take advantage of the real estate, I am sure those value to be made for their shareholders. But that\u2019s not necessarily a focus for us. We are very pleased to have partnered with both these folks and we expect them to grow. Rick? Richard Sokolov : The only other thing that I would add is that it does put a spotlight on the fact that the credit worthiness and operating stability of our department store companies I believe is greater than the analyst in the investment community has recognized before and when we\u2019ve said all along we thought that they were in a stable position. I think that\u2019s being worn-out by the ability to add financial stability by taking a focus on the real estate asset. Ross Nussbaum : And David did you separate out the Hudson's Bay venture from SPG because you didn\u2019t want a bunch of boring long terms net leases in SPG or was there something other than that? David Simon : Well I think it is part of SPG and first of all it hasn\u2019t actually closed yet. We are closing when we announced that it should be closing in the next, by the end of the quarter probably, but we\u2019ve always view that is ultimately a standalone business going forward. Now that will help grow faster, the credit, the net lease retailer, I mean we \u2013 they are great retailers. We are going to run that joint venture. They\u2019ve got great real estate entrepreneurs. We certainly can underwrite retail credit. We have ideas on how to grow that business. So, ultimately that business could in fact end up separated from us, but we will want to add value to it through our deal making capabilities and yes it probably, if it ends up more focused on the credit, you know the credit lease business you know it\u2019s \u2013 that probably is better separated from SPG in long run, but of that is to be determined whilst as we go forward. Ross Nussbaum : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler ONeill. Please proceed. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. David just a few questions here, first you brought up the rating agencies in your comments. So, two questions on that, one is the 7% cap rate that they are using clearly we\u2019ve had a number of demonstrable mall trades that show cap rates are well below, so curious if they are going to move away from the 7% and second on that is, as you guys entertain the Macerich to buy them, did the rating agencies do any push back to you guys on your rating or their view is they know who you are and even if anything was breached they know that you would resolve that in due course and therefore a rating impact was unlikely. David Simon : Well. Look I will speak to the last first, I mean, no they have all the confidence in the world in us when it comes to doing a transaction of that nature that we were \u2013 that we did not expect to be downgraded or notched at all, right Andy? Andrew Juster : Right. I mean they\u2019ve done $40 billion of acquisition and they\u2019ve been very pleased with the results. David Simon : So, and again as not that this is all that interesting anymore, but part of the reason we were selling assets to GGP was in fact, you know the primary reason was in fact to make sure that our A rating would stay in place. As far as the seven, yes they should update it, it\u2019s silly. But you know\u2026 Andrew Juster : It is a disastrous scenario\u2026 David Simon : But they are being conservative. It\u2019s not market, I agree with you. I don\u2019t know what to do about it. Andrew Juster : I used to be eight and nine. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So, glacial compression there. Second question is, on the Hudson Bay can you just talk a little bit about the challenges of having real estate and other people centers and we\u2019ve seen other companies in the past trying to do that hasn\u2019t worked out, was there a different perspective that you guys have on making that work or how should we think that this time it may work versus what we\u2019ve seen historically? David Simon : That\u2019s not really even there is no thinking that boy it\u2019s great to have own real estate in other peoples centers. That\u2019s really not \u2013 this is a growth vehicle to go find other opportunities in the credit world based on retail real estate. Right now, Hudson\u2019s Bay has all of the plans to operate those stores, so there is nothing about in that sense. Obviously if for whatever reason they decide to not to operate the store, we would have that opportunity. So that\u2019s really not anywhere near on the agenda. We value this at a pretty attractive cap rate 6% and 8% in really good mall. So we think it\u2019s attractive accretive transaction for us from a value point of view, and it\u2019s really about creating the entity to go do more stuff and seeding it with these stores as opposed to we\u2019re going to go play. We have no intention at all to go play any kind of habit or anything in other people\u2019s mall, so that\u2019s not even on the agenda. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just finally, your presentation on Macerich you guys disclosed your top center productivity and some of your mall stats. If there is any way if that could be obviously quarterly would be great, but annually I mean it was tremendous retail candy for us and obviously helps in the analysis of you guys. So if there is a suggestion box, would love to see that on an annual basis. David Simon : Speaking of suggestion boxes, I better not say this because I might get criticized but I remember at a golf club that was built by Pete and Dye, a Crooked Stick here in Indianapolis. And the member\u2019s suggestion box is in the middle of the pond, okay. But I will not, that will not be duly noted and I am not saying that but duly noted. And look I think we put that together because we felt it was important if there are any confusion about stuff that was said there, we wanted to clarify that. Frankly, Alex, we look at ourselves differently than a collection of assets, but duly noted express \u2013 everybody express their views on that. To Tom, we have been I think as clear and as articulate in our financial presentations as anybody. We have never wavered from FFO as an example. We delivered via the white paper. Occasionally like with WP Spin we separate that out because it\u2019s important to note a transaction of that nature but we give you WP first or we give you FFO first and then we show you whatever is important to change. So I feel like we necessarily are a little different in that area, but duly noted we won\u2019t make [indiscernible] to the pond to put in your suggestion. We will take it up Tom and we\u2019ll see about it in the future. Alexander Goldfarb : Awesome. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning, David. David Simon : Hi. Steve Sakwa : Couple of questions, I don\u2019t think you disclosed the percentage ownership in the Brickell transaction. Is that something you could provide and what role exactly is Simon playing in this development? David Simon : We\u2019re going to have a 25% interest in the retail and we are going to see the manager of the retail portion of the project and we are going to be leaving the leasing effort along with Swire and Whitman Property. Steve Sakwa : Okay. So you will be the \u2013 I guess the leasing agent on this. David Simon : Yeah. Steve Sakwa : Okay. I guess David on Copley, I didn\u2019t hear any talk on that. Where do we stand on the residential project? David Simon : Well, we have an upcoming BRA meeting which is there in the next month. We are hopeful to get approved and there will be a couple other hurdles after that, but that puts us on the path to start construction. So the next month or so we thought we were going to be able to do it. This month things got a little, couple of political things happened out of control, but we\u2019ve been assured that we can get back on the agenda here in this upcoming month. Steve Sakwa : No, it sounds like maybe kind of June, July start. David Simon : Yes. I think we should, we feel comfortable by July. We will have all of the permits and all of the approvals done. You know it\u2019s a fluid situation, but that\u2019s correct. Steve Sakwa : And if that\u2019s the case I guess when would the sales process, like just help us think through the timing if you start construction. When does a sales office start, just how far after that, is that a year later? David Simon : That\u2019s not going to start for a year after that, only because you know the complexity of this build is significant. So we have to go down the turnpike support the foundation and then we got to go into Neiman Marcus store, relay that and then go up. So, there is no real need to rush that. I\u2019d say roughly a year from now that would be the focus, a lots going on at the mall. We are going to start the renovation of the actual interior of it. We are going to do the south west portal entrance. So there is a lot \u2013 we are finishing the office reno, so it is a property that were a lot is going on, but I\u2019d say the sales office would be probably roughly a year from now. Steve Sakwa : Okay and then last question, I mean you mentioned all of the major projects you\u2019ve got going on in the U.S. here, I am just curious how do you feel about sort of the international investment opportunities versus domestic? David Simon : Well, with the outlet business, you know we\u2019ve got, I mentioned in my call we have three that we think we\u2019re going to start this year. We have great outlet in Provence partnering with MGE, McArthurGlen. We\u2019ve got a new site with fantastic developer in Mexico [indiscernible] which has built some of the best malls who is our partner in Mexico City. We expect that to start this year and then we\u2019ve got with Genting Group, we are very close to finalizing the deal to start our second outlet in Malaysia and I mentioned to you we just finished Yeoju and Shisui expansion. So that\u2019s a lot of activity internationally. We are also working on a couple of other opportunities in the outlet with some new joint ventures and then we have got another site, two sites in Canada. So, internationally on the development front with the outlet, premium outlet product we are busy. And then again, with Kl\u00e9pierre we help do this huge deal that here domestically people don\u2019t think about, but it was a 7.4 billion euro deal. They just closed March 31. They also bought a great asset in Spain shortly thereafter, you know there is tremendous amount going on with the integration and the portfolio review of the long terms assets. There is a lot of development work going on as well within the total combined portfolio. So, that to us is kind of we view that as our full price retail entity going forward in continental Europe and I expect that company to continue to grow. So, we are active internationally. I don\u2019t see us buying full price retail in Asia or other parts, I mean I think right now it is kind of finding new markets for our premium outlook product. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys \u2013 I guess first question just on the factors behind your higher FFO guidance, curious if there is any changes to your FX outlook and the middle guidance. And if there is any level of perhaps share repurchase baked into the full year with outlook? David Simon : The answer is no on the share buyback and no \u2013 we\u2019ve factored in the currency where it is today. So we have a few cents. Last quarter, quarter one of \u201914 the Euro was $1.37 average, this year it was $1.13 so that\u2019s a pretty big gap, now it\u2019s $1.08. Andrew Juster : 41%, right. David Simon : We are pretty proud that we took a $0.03 hit in our Q1 \u201915 and still beat consensus pretty good within our numbers. It\u2019s clearly going to affect our total. We have $0.10 roughly year-over-year that was in that range. We have a little bit exposure, but drops further but nothing that we can\u2019t deal with. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, fair enough. And following up on the Miami project with Swire, just want to clarify first. The 25% ownership, that\u2019s just on the retail or is that the entire project? David Simon : Just the retail. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And then the strategic decision involved with the project now. Why now did you approach them, did they approach you and then how should we think about the project in terms of merchandising mix? It looks like GDP their nearby design district has a bit of stranglehold on luxury. How much of a challenge do you think that might present your ability to track a higher tier tenant retailers? David Simon : Well, they approached us and look we have been involved in this for a while. We feel unbelievably confident we are going to deliver obviously they designed it and they\u2019ve done the most of the work, but we feel together we\u2019re going to deliver a great product that I think is going to the marketplace. There is no question that this is going to be a unique terrific long term mixed use retail asset. I think it will blow \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to blow people\u2019s minds away and the leasing. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress on leasing and we are very, very confident about our ability to deliver a very, very compelling mix. Andrew Juster : The only thing I would add is that this project in and of itself as a hotel to condo towers and to office towers and surrounding it, there is another eight or nine residential office and hotel projects going on in the hotter brick haul. So it\u2019s a very young, very sophisticated and very well paced submarket inside of the State County overall market we are very excited about it. Haendel St. Juste: Too early to talk about target yields? Richard Sokolov : Yeah. Look since we have partners in there, it will be put in our 8-K but that kind of stuff is probably not going to be singled-out out of respect for partners, but we think it\u2019s an attractive investment and we wouldn\u2019t make it otherwise. And as I said, this will be produced in a very high level. Swire and the Whitman family are first-class operators you couldn\u2019t pick that of partners and we all know Bell Harbor for sure and we all know what Swire has done in China and Hong Kong. It built some of the most amazing stuff. So to be associated with those kind of folks on a long term basis, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased and we will make money in this investment, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t do it. Haendel St. Juste: Could there be more or you contemplating additional investments with Swire or is it again too early to talk about that? David Simon : We are not in Hong Kong and this is their big investment in the U.S. which certainly have a lot of respect for that organization. Haendel St. Juste: Okay but just to be clear at this point there is nothing talked about perhaps overseas with them in Asia, Hong Kong or China. David Simon : No. Haendel St. Juste: Alright thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Andrew Rosivach : Sorry guys I tried to get out of the queue it was running away, but really quick, you guys have listed amazing metrics, specially relative basis, especially when you are taking to account leverage and unfortunately you can go through quarters where that actually doesn\u2019t influence your share price and I am just curious just in terms of, unfortunately my clients have tried to get rate and discussions over the last couple of quarters, you know when you bid for another company that your shareholder don\u2019t own you can actually harm the relative performance of your supporters and I\u2019m just wondering like is that part of the decision making process you kind of know it will hurt and you make the call that the long term gain actually offsets a certain pain or is it not in the calculus? David Simon : Well we always want feedback from our shareholders and we always take that into account, but hopefully they have confidence in us, but we are making right decisions that will add to the value of their investment and we are always confronted whether it is a M&A deal or new development or redevelopment to weigh short-term paying for long term gain. We thankfully, hopefully will continue, but certainly historically we\u2019ve made pretty good decisions on that front. We\u2019ve certainly have embedded a 1000 of where we\u2019ve been made risky investments. We\u2019ve done it on a low key basis and small basis compared to the enterprise and I go back to two to jump out of me, you know one was the one in China. The other was in, I call my blue period where we are doing all the technology, you know in the late, whenever I was \u2013 I try to forget about it. Late 90s early 2000, so you know I would say to with this last situation, I mean the shareholders that we spoke to at least what they told me they were supportive of what we were trying to accomplish and that\u2019s what they told me and again, I mean we never got to the point where we were able to lay out all that we could do there, but we certainly always factor that in. We do know that sometimes doing these things is not the easy road. You know the easy road is to just do what a lot of other folks do, which is not a lot, okay. But this company is all about not doing what is easy. And then it\u2019s easy just to you know I don\u2019t know redevelop a thing here, build something there, but that\u2019s not what we are about, we are about and are trying to make this company unique and when you do that you sometimes you do create short-term confusion and/or short term underperformance. We hope, all we can do we hope is that people look at the track record and look at dividend growth. I mean 15% dividend growth at a company our size \u2026 Andrew Rosivach : There is not push back on that. There is no push back that you are actually great at doing M&A, it just when it goes on for a quarter and most of my clients are based on one of your performance on a relative basis that after a while it starts to hurt and I even got the impression you know when you wrote your March 20 final offer, I got a sense when you were saying not to go through multi-year proxy, I think you were starting to notice the pain it was creating with your share price. David Simon : Well look that is a whole different subject that is probably better off, I am happy to have you with or anybody else, but it is probably better off to have that not necessarily on \u2013 in this kind of format, but we \u2013 look short term, we are all about short term gain if there is a long term play there but it\u2019s important to have support from our shareholders. And I can say to you that they were the ones that I talk to or relatively support of what we try to accomplish, but on the other hand going through a multiyear proxy fight et cetera. If we had done that, that\u2019s when we might have lost support. That\u2019s a judgment call I have to make and I made the judgment call and I did. I think the support would have been there had we on the deal, rather the support would have been there on a long drawn out battle, I don\u2019t know. But I decide to not to ask for. Andrew Rosivach : Thanks for your commentary. Appreciate it. David Simon : Sure. No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Vincent Chao : Hi, good morning everyone. Just wanted to go back to the FX question a little bit, I appreciate the comments on the earnings side of things. Just curious last quarter we talked a little about the impact on some of the tourism driven markets. Just wondering if you could give I guess an update on what you\u2019re seeing in those markets as it pertains to FX impacts? David Simon : In the U.S. side with the strong dollar. Vincent Chao : Right. David Simon : Yeah, okay. Fair enough. We are seeing a little bit \u2013 I would tell you that it\u2019s just really volatile right now on some of those tourist markets where there is a good month, a good week, and then there is a bad month and a bad week. So it kind of balances out, but I would say it\u2019s safe to say that the strong dollar is affecting to some extent sales in some of the really highly international assets that we have but nothing that\u2019s going to change our financial profile or earnings or any of that. But it is a lot more volatile, you hear occasionally in South Florida a little bit, you hear \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen anything at Woodbury but I\u2019ve heard a lot in New York, now we have no exposure there but you hear and then when I say hear, I\u2019m hearing from the retailers, but with something to pay attention to it. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks. And then just more domestically just given the drop in oil prices, it seems like there was expectations that would flow into the economy, but seems like it\u2019s being saved. Just curious if you are seeing anything different from that in your own mall traffic and that kind of that. David Simon : I\u2019d still say generally we are still dealing with a cautious consumer, it\u2019s safe to say and it\u2019s volatile. So the comment I heard about the tourism also applies to just the domestic consumer as well. The patterns of the consumer are tougher to predict right now. I still think there is \u2013 confidence is getting better, but there is still a lot of debt being reduced and it\u2019s still there is a good month, good week, and then a bad month, a bad week and the pattern is sloppy enough but it\u2019s certainly not getting busters. And look we had 2% total sales increase from quarter-over-quarter \u201914 to \u201915. That\u2019s the kind of world we are in right now. We did get unbelievably so we did not mention this, Nova [ph] mentioned in it so I probably shouldn\u2019t mention it but we had another awful winter in northeast. For those of you in Boston only, we have a lot of exposure in northeast. Believe it or not, our snow expense was higher this year than last year across the portfolio. So we still had to deal with a little bit of the weather, but we are dealing with a cautious consumer and we are delivering \u2013 the good news is, we are delivering results in that environment. That\u2019s all we can do. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you very much. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed. Carol Kemple : Good morning. Thinking about the premium outlet pipeline out there, how much room do you think there is for premium outlets of Simon\u2019s quality to be built in the U.S.? Can you quantify a number? Are there 20 possible sites left in the U.S., or where do you think that number would be? David Simon : Well, I think that would be a real challenge of our kind of quality to produce. Right now, the way we look at it, 20 additional outlets. I still think it\u2019s a handful. We are going through \u2013 the industry is going through a little bit of a growth spurt. But, Carol, I would say, 20 would be a stretch. I\u2019m going to \u2013 this is so hard to give you a real number, but I would say \u2013 as we look at the stuff that we might see building, we\u2019ve got three now that will start, maybe another two or three next year. But from our standpoint, I would see under 10 over the next three to five years, domestic starts within our portfolio. Carol Kemple : Okay. Rick Sokolov : The one thing I would say to you Carol is when you think about growth, please don\u2019t forget about the expansions that David mentioned earlier. They are almost the equivalent in terms of productivity of a new outlet. We are adding a lot of square footage at Chicago and at Woodbury and at San Francisco. And all of that is adding mass, and that\u2019s absorbing demand in the most productive way that could possibly happen. And I encourage all of you to go out and see what we just opened at Desert Hills, and if you are out in Las Vegas, what we are opening in Las Vegas North the week of the ICSC convention. These things are dramatic expansions with great retailers that are highly, highly productive. Carol Kemple : Okay, thanks. And then this question is for Rick. We\u2019ve heard a lot about store closings. I know you love to give your list of who wants the space. Do you have any new names for us? David Simon : I can\u2019t wait. Rick Sokolov : Well, you have to relax and stretch. But I think one thing that I would like to point out to everybody is we talk about all this, the tenant that has the broadest footprint in our portfolio is L Brands, with Victoria\u2019s Secret and they are doing great results, and they are growing and they are expanding and they are adding things to the Victoria's Secret stores. But we are doing with a lot of international retailers that people haven\u2019t -- DAVIDsTEA has come down, we are growing UNIQLO, we are growing H&M, we are growing Sephora, and we are growing Altar\u2019d State, which is a great retailer that has got a significant growth platform. And frankly, as David said, the ones that left are low productivity, oversized. So that gives us the opportunity to bring in higher productivity retailers that are just going to increase the market share of our properties. Carol Kemple : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Just a quick one. It sounds like a lot could be going on at Syosset. So how much of that project would you actually do yourselves? David Simon : Yeah, in terms of the mixed use, we haven\u2019t gotten to that point, Michael. We probably \u2013 when it gets to the office, we will probably sell the office. We might partner on the residential, but \u2013 again, there is roughly 400,000 of retail, so that we will do with our partner. The other hotel we may or may not do. So my guess is at the end of the day, we\u2019d probably look to either sell or joint venture. We probably won\u2019t do the office; we might sell or joint venture the other uses. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was pretty much it. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. No worries. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays Capital. Please proceed. Linda Tsai : Hi. When people talk about omni-channel, my sense is that they think of traditional mall-based or full-priced stores. To what extent are you seeing omni-channel capabilities incorporated into the Premium Outlet model? Do you think this is something that makes sense for you and the retailers? David Simon : Well, I think the retailers as they bring in the omni-channel world to their physical stores will certainly apply to the outlet world as well. And again, they are all at different degrees of that integration. But I don\u2019t think outlets would be ignored on that front at all. So I would expect that to be part of it. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question, we have a follow-up from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman, again. David, I\u2019m just curious to get your thoughts a little bit on Land and Buildings and Orange Capital\u2019s proxy campaign post them rebuffing your offer. And at least in Jon\u2019s letter he references a conversation that he had with you and, obviously, I don\u2019t know if that conversation is done verbatim. But it implied that what you had told him was based on where Simon\u2019s stock is currently, almost $200; that that would imply $100 for Macerich. So I\u2019m just curious how you think about that as well as their campaign. David Simon : Well, look, I\u2019m not \u2013 put it this way, I\u2019m not surprised by Land and Buildings\u2019 and Orange\u2019s \u2013 that they might pursue something like this, or others. But as you can see from their proxy materials, we are not participating or providing any financial support in their proxy. But I\u2019m not surprised that someone like them would take up this particular issue. But, again, we are not\u2014this is not us, this is them. And I said to you, you can see it from their preliminary proxy stuff that we\u2019re not supporting or involved in that at all. And then, as a shareholder, we will wait and see what happens. Michael Bilerman : Right. I guess as a shareholder, when they came out after rebuffing your offer for the final time, then they put out their presentation of the plan forward, I guess as a shareholder would you have wanted to know how they achieve a price equal to or greater than the offer that you had put on the table? And I guess did that surprise you that that wasn\u2019t in there? David Simon : Well, look, that\u2019s up for Macerich to respond to. I mean I can only tell you what I told you earlier, which is I think we put a hell of a deal on the table and I was looking to engage with Art. I consider Art a peer. We\u2019ve had a good relationship. People say hostile offer. I don\u2019t \u2013 let me give you my thinking on this. Any time somebody offers a lot of money to somebody, I never consider that hostile, okay? Now, it may not be \u2013 it maybe unsolicited, but it ain\u2019t hostile\u2026 Michael Bilerman : At a 30% premium, no less. David Simon : Okay. It ain\u2019t hostile. So I hope Art and the board realizes that I didn\u2019t view it as hostile. I view it \u2013 sure, it was unsolicited, but it was a hell of an offer done in the spirit of trying to negotiate a deal at a big number and I will leave it at that. It\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news, but I will leave it at that. But it was not hostile. Unsolicited, absolutely. But, again, anytime I think \u2013 I\u2019m a simpleton when it comes to this \u2013 but anytime you offer a big number to somebody, I don\u2019t view that as hostile. I just view that as of the way of the world, I guess. Michael Bilerman : Yes, okay. Thanks, David. David Simon : All right. No worries. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over to David for closing remarks. David Simon : All right. Thank you, everyone, and take care and we will talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good morning. We had a productive quarter we completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced even more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We identified additional avenues for growth through our two new retail partner joint ventures. And most importantly, we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which included a $0.22 gain on a sale of marketable securities. Excluding the investment gain, FFO per share was $2.41, which exceeded First Call consensus again by $0.06. These results were achieved even with the negative impact of $0.04 for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter due to a strong dollar against the Euro and Yen. On a comparable basis excluding the contribution from WP properties in the prior year period and again the investment gain, our FFO per diluted share increased 14.2% or over $0.30 year-over-year. Occupancy was 96.1%, leasing activity remains healthy. We recorded spreads of $10.87 an increase of 18.4%. Comp NOI for the quarter increase 3.6%, which was coming of a 5.6% comp increase in the second quarter of 2014 and for those of you that are interested, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI or new deals such as Jersey Gardens or our recent joint venture activity and we also do not include the impact of recently developed or expanded centers. And finally, we continue to produce strong comp NOI increases year after year as well as continue to operate at the highest margins in our industry. Total sales across the portfolio will increase 2.2% for the trailing 12 months even with the loss of bankrupt tenants. On a comparable basis, the sales per square foot increase for the 12 months ending June 30 was 4.2%. And as a reminder our sales per square foot metric is not adjusted to remove any tenants who have vacated their spaces and includes tenant sales activity for all months a tenant is open during the trailing 12-month period. Redevelopment is ongoing to 28 properties across all three platforms for total spend of $1.7 billion. We opened significant expansion activities at Las Vegas North and Shisui Premium Outlets in Japan started construction on several new and strategic projects during the quarter. Construction continues on some iconic properties including Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford Shopping Center, King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our premium outlets are expanding in Chicago, San Francisco and Woodbury. This is my opportunity to develop my list, as opposed to Rick's. Our Chicago and San Francisco outlets open \u2013 expansion open in August and the rest of those kind of expanding of those iconic centers open in the next 12 months. We also announced plans for further expansions in Sawgrass, The Mills at Jersey Gardens, La Plaza Mall, and the shops at Riverside. And we expect our redevelopment investment to be at least to $1 billion annually through 2017 substantially funded with our annual free cash flow, which will continue to contribute incremental growth in our NOI and reinforce the positions of those assets in the respective marketplaces. Now, let\u2019s turn to new development, construction. It continues on three new outlets all in very major markets and they are scheduled to open in the next three months. Gloucester in Southern Jersey in Philadelphia in fact opens in two weeks, August 13. Tampa and Tucson open in October. And finally we opened Vancouver on July 9, with traffic that exceeded expectations. Construction continued or in fact started in Columbus with our partner Tanger, and we are slated to begin construction in one new domestic premium outlet, which will be announced for year-end. We also started construction at the shops at Clearfork, our new full-price development in Fort Worth anchored by Neiman Marcus which will open in early 2017 and we are pleased to partner with Swire and the Whitman family on the retail component of Brickell City Centre, which will open in the fall of 2016. We own 25% of its project and will manage this center upon completion. Kl\u00e9pierre continues to progress according to plan. Their integration of Corio is proceeding well, they continue to recycle their assets and in fact announced a deal to sell a portfolio of Netherlands assets for \u20ac770 million, and which will continue to delever their company. We also purchased 2% of Kl\u00e9pierre from the BNP offering. We\u2019re now over 20 point \u2013 we\u2019re at 20.3%. We purchased those and the stock is obviously trading higher than where we purchase that additional 2%. Balance sheet activity continues strong, we did several secured financings in the quarter, continue to lower our borrowing cost, increased our debt maturity. Our liquidity is $5.5 billion. Our industry-leading balance sheet continues to get reinforced and separates us from our peer group. Our unencumbered cash flow is well over $2.5 billion as Andy shakes his head affirmatively. And finally on the balance sheet we, as you know, announced our $2 billion share repurchase we in fact in the quarter bought $505 million during the quarter of both common and units which is disclosed. Now the dividend and let\u2019s not lose side of the dividend. We have announced yet another increase sequentially at 3% through $1.55 and the year-over-year increase of 19%. We will pay at least $6 in 2015, which is an increase of at least 17% from 2014 and well above where we were in the great recession at the height of $3.60 in 2008. So finally guidance has been increased again up to $10.02 to $10.07. And we are now ready for your questions. Operator : Our first question will be coming from the line of Ross Nussbaum. Your line is open. Ross Nussbaum : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Here with Jeremy Metz. Hey, David with the repurchase from the OP unitholders, who were the sellers of those units? Did you approach them? Did they approach you? How did that work? David Simon : A little bit of both, it was associated with the prime transaction loss that we completed in 2010 and they were the sellers. Ross Nussbaum : Okay, so no members of the Simon family sold\u2026 David Simon : That's correct. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. Okay, and then on the buyback as well, how should we think about it from a balance sheet perspective? If I look at your funding needs against your after-dividend free cash flow, my math is basically you can fund your entire development program with, call it $1 billion of free cash flow a year. So if you continue to buyback stock at this rate, obviously, the leverage of the company would tick higher. So how should we all think about continued buyback versus balance sheet? David Simon : Well, it\u2019s a very good question. I think the first \u2013 we want that in our arsenal. We are sensitive to \u2013 it\u2019s part of our capital allocation strategy. I think you should look at this first step is a trade from one, from our other marketable securities that we had held with no reason to hold those we basically took that capital and reinvested in our business as we wanted to signal the market that we believe and the continual growth of our enterprise. I think it should also signal, we are out of the big deal business. So I think no ones picked that up, but we don't see any big deals on the horizon for us. So we are obviously very focused on the development, redevelopment as you know I mean I stumble I\u2019m not a very good reader of a text, but you look at our activity in the redevelopment and new development it\u2019s astronomical, it\u2019s industry-leading lots of great stuff going on and I think that's the way to look at it. We are price-sensitive, we wanted there. REIT stocks have been very volatile, but I think if the signal that we took one investment and reinforced that we\u2019re out of the big deal business. That's not to say we might find a deal here or there, but the balance sheet is sacrosanct to us, we haven't worked 22 years to do it, we survived the last great recession with flying colors, we quadrupled our dividend and earning per share and all the other stuff that I won\u2019t go through it all, but I think it's a more of a signal and the belief in our business and also signal the market that were out of the big deal business. Operator : Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Great. Hey, David, good morning. Just continuing in terms of the buyback, you talk about your business and having confidence in your business. You didn't talk a little bit about discount to NAV and the arbitrage that exists between public and private. I take your comment exactly in terms of flipping out of Macerich that $450 million, putting it into your own stock, which I think has great prospects. But would you think about accelerating or selling interest in any assets to go further into your stock and narrow that discount that exists between public and private? David Simon : Well, look, I think the reason - it's more than just NAV. It\u2019s what your enterprise can do in terms of growing your earnings and cash flow, and then ultimately increasing your dividend. I mean as you know I mean, if you strip out the gain in that WPR, our quarter-over-quarter growth was 14.3% which as you know, a lot of people have criticized our size yet we continue to be industry-leading earnings growth. So you\u2019ve got to look at, whenever you invest in something, what's that yield going to get you? And as our earnings grows you know that\u2019s not a bad investment. So it\u2019s more than just the NAV analysis. We also - we will continue to sell what I call lower quality non-important assets to us. We don't publicize it until after it's done, but we\u2019ll continue to prune the portfolio. But we\u2019re not a big believer in selling our top assets to reinforce the value of our company for external purposes I mean we know what we\u2019re worth and we operate - I mean, that\u2019s why we are in this job. We\u2019ll operate accordingly. But selling the top assets at the end of the day those top assets tend to grow the most. And I'd rather have our shareholders own more of it than less of it. We have the free cash flow to take advantage of the arb that may exist between private and public values, and it\u2019s just another tool that we have available to us to take advantage as we look for investment opportunities. Michael Bilerman : Great. Just one quick one for Rick. The popular press wants to focus a lot on shrinking retailers and closing stores. Can you just give us an update in terms of who are the fastest-growing retailers, the most exciting retailers that you're seeing pick up stores? And maybe just break it up between a larger format and a smaller format store base. Richard Sokolov : Well, thank you for the opportunity to talk about my list. I think there\u2019s four categories of retailers that we\u2019re really seeing a lot of business with. International retailers, the e-tailers that are looking for a presence in our properties. We recently just announced and have opened Blue Nile and Bauble Bar, and we\u2019re working with a number of others that want to come into the properties. Our existing retailers that are looking to grow through brand extension. Maybe you just saw Dick\u2019s announce the Chelsea Collective this fall. L Brands is rolling out White Barn Candle. And the last are just the new retailers that are coming online and just to - we\u2019ve done deals recently with Mont Blanc, Frye Boots, Jo Malone's, Suitsupply, [Aritskina]. All of these are really exciting concepts that are relatively unique in the number of stores, and that\u2019s going to separate our properties. Michael Bilerman : Great thank you. David Simon : And I would just say this, Michael, what\u2019s exciting \u2013 yes, we have had bankruptcies this year, it does take time to replace them. But the amount of new concepts and new entrepreneurs coming into our environment, whether it\u2019s restaurants, the e-commerce going to physical brand expansion is really at a \u2013 is that high and our leasing folks. If you seen what we\u2019re going to do at Roosevelt Field with some of the new food operators as well as some of the e-commerce with physical, I mean its good stuff. So I mean in that sense it\u2019s comforting to see that there is whole host of new entrepreneurs they want to be in our own environments. Michael Bilerman : Yes, thanks. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Morgan. Your line is open. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Paul Morgan : You talked about how your same-store numbers don't include your redevelopments. I'm just wondering. At this point right now it seems like you have a very large share of some of your top centers in redevelopments. Is that a drag, having that excluded, given the strength of some of those? David Simon : First of all, we don\u2019t consider to drag, you have to put comp numbers in a \u2013 Paul you have to put comp numbers in a historical perspective. And you can\u2019t look it one quarter over quarter, you\u2019ve got to look at it over three to five-year period upon. And if you look at our comp NOI increases over that three to five-year period of time, there clearly you would conclude that we have significant outperformance. And I don't look as much as everyone wants to focus on a quarter here and quarter there. I want to reinforce we do have the highest operating margins in the business. We also have the lowest overhead in terms of however you want do it enterprise value \u2013 percent of EBITDA, percent of revenues in the business. And that\u2019s why we have the best balance sheet in the business and that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to grow our dividend 15% to 20% a year. So again certainly there are \u2013 yes, we\u2019re remerchandising Houston Galleria, and Copley, and Stanford, and Roosevelt Field, and King of Prussia and we\u2019re moving tenants left and right. We encourage everybody to go see the properties and yes, from a quarter perspective it's going to \u2013 it's not going to impress some, but I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re doing I\u2019m really impressed with internally. But I would encourage you and others to look at comp NOI over a more of an extended period of times than comp quarter-to-quarter. Paul Morgan : So I mean if I do that\u2026 David Simon : But again long story short, yes, we are having some impact on all the remerchandising going on in our portfolio. Paul Morgan : So I mean if I take that longer view and look back over the past, say, two or three years in your numbers, is there any reason to think as I look forward two or three years that you wouldn't be able to do kind of the same type of numbers, I guess deeper into the economic cycle? David Simon : Well, listen history is a good indicator of what you might be able to do in the future, but we would hope that all the stuff that we\u2019re doing will accelerate the growth profile of those assets. We have to execute, believe me, we are not out of the execution phase, but I would think Paul at the end of the day that these assets are going to grow very, very nicely and we\u2019ll increase our comp NOI growth and meet our historical growth. Now the fact is we\u2019re subject to economic cycles, we\u2019re subject to tenants going bankrupt, we are subject to downtime, we\u2019re subject to sales of our retailers, volatility. So we don't control everything, but we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record. I would hope that would continue, but it's not you don\u2019t follow-up a lot for this stuff. You got to do it each and everyday and our team was pretty good at it. Paul Morgan : Thanks. And then just my follow-up on the Sears joint venture. How far you into the process of going through and saying : well, here's what we're going to do near-term, here we\u2019d like to do longer-term. And kind of how \u2013 the size of the potential redevelopment and the timing and when we might get some of those details? Richard Sokolov : Hi, it\u2019s Rick. We are very far along in that process, we\u2019ve already had multiple meetings with Seritage. We have developed, redevelopment plans for each of the assets they are in the process right now of being priced and as they become mature, we will announce them and proceed forward, but they include the addition of specialty stores, mall expansion, adding restaurants, adding boxes and appropriately sizing Sears. Bear in mind in our venture it\u2019s almost 850,000 square feet of additional space if you are going to be able to redeploy along with those TBA auto centers. So it\u2019s a great opportunity and we are well into it. Paul Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector. Jeffrey Spector : I just wanted to focus a little bit more on the redevelopment pipeline. David, I believe you said that $1 billion through 2017, and I know it's been going on for a number of years now. I mean what are your thoughts I guess at this point beyond 2017? Is that \u2013 by 2017 you are really at this point touching those top-producing assets? Or do you think you can expand that program beyond? David Simon : Well, I think as Rick mentioned I mean I do think Sears gives us whole host additional redevelopment opportunities. We are closer and closer to starting \u2013 in fact we are actually starting the Southwest Corridor and Copley, which is not in those numbers yet. We are absent something really out of the expected, we are going to start Copley very, very shortly, we've got fail safes in that investment, but we are moving with speed to deliver that, we think that's great Sears presents a lot of opportunities. We've got outlets that we've done the big ones, we\u2019re doing a bunch of small ones that we need to look at. Rick, you want to add to it. Richard Sokolov : I would also tell you, we\u2019ve already announced the expansion in Jersey Gardens that\u2019s going to be a major redevelopment, we have announced the expansion of Sawgrass. Right now we're finalizing an expansion of Colonnade, redeveloping the Oasis. And I can tell we are continuing the mine this portfolio and I believe we\u2019ll have a continuing series of pretty substantial value add opportunities across all three of our platforms. Jeffrey Spector : Okay, thanks. And then one of the other focuses that Craig and I have been paying attention to, of course, on the technology front, the winners in the Simon Launch and in particular the SKU IQ. So from where we sit I guess it's just been hard over the last year to really keep track of exactly what's going on here on these different initiatives. Can you discuss either the winners or SKU IQ in particular and where you think this may go? David Simon : Yes, look I don't get mad at me Jeff, but I believe we are happy to do \u2013 I think we are close to putting together with Skyler and Michael and investor, I don\u2019t know what you call them investor, not roadshow but investor meeting to kind of layout all the investment we made and maybe with not exactly you maybe with somebody else, but well-respected peer of yours and we\u2019ll lay it out for the investment community all that different investments we've made and why. So I think we\u2019re shooting for sometime in October but there's a lot of neat stuff here. These are little - in the scheme of things, little investments, but they run from creating energy efficiency with all of our LED lighting to helping retailers to actually new e-commerce ideas that may go to the mall. So it\u2019s a lot of different categories, different levels of investment, in the kind of the A, B, C rounds. We\u2019re happy to share that data. It\u2019s a lot, though, to do it on a call like this. But we will be sharing a lot of that stuff with our investors. Jeffrey Spector : Okay, thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. A quick follow-up first. Have you bought any more shares post the quarter end? David Simon : We operated - if you are familiar, you have to operate under a 10(b) 15 rule once your quarter is completed. We gave guidelines because you can't be in the market during that period of time and the guidelines that we gave to the broker were not met. So the answer is we have not purchased any further. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. The second question, is there any incremental change in trends you're noticing in the outlet business? Maybe not the premium, at more infill outlets, but maybe more secondary, where maybe the pricing gap between full-line mall retailers and outlet businesses or retailers are maybe narrowing? You've seen like T.J. Maxx and Ross doing better. Have the secondary type of outlets - do you notice any less importance or less traffic or any kind of incremental trends? David Simon : Not really, I mean I think not really at all. I mean I think our outlet retailers are very focused on finding the right balance between full price in outlet that\u2019s why they are very focused on not overexposing the brand. There have been certain retailers that have had disappointing sales both in full price and in outlet. Outlet\u2019s no different than full price in that if a retailer is not hitting it, it will affect their sales in full-price and in outlet. But no trend in that at all. We have outlets in Cincinnati, Columbus, Indiana, St. Louis, that are all doing just fine. They are affected by retailers that may not be doing as well as they were a year ago, but that's similar to the full price small business as well. Ki Bin Kim : Okay thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning out there. David Simon : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, how are you? Just a few questions here David, first just going back to the dividend and stock buyback, certainly as you guys outlined where you want put your money, redevelopment and development seems to be the first and foremost. And then when you move down from there, once you've solved for paying out appropriate with the taxable income, it sounds like your bias is still towards increasing the dividend versus buyback. So I just want to see if that\u2019s the proper interpretation from your comments or if you are thinking that any excess cash may now go more towards buyback versus the strong dividend growth. David Simon : Well, the dividend - listen, this sounds weird, but we're highly profitable, right? So as our earnings increase you know our taxable income increases and therefore our dividend increases. Very simple that\u2019s the REIT model. We\u2019re great believers in the REIT model that\u2019s why we are all here. And so our dividend is going to increase. There is just no two ways about it, because we have created a very nice earnings machines as long as we don\u2019t make mistakes about where we invest capital, we\u2019ll be in good shape. So I always like increasing the dividend more than stock buybacks, we had this unusual situation where we basically took one investment and felt the most immediate interesting return would be buying our stock back. I think having the flexibility to buy it in a volatile market, when there is a big disconnect is what will be focused on. But I would continue to expect knock on wood that our earnings continue to move up, we\u2019re going to be focused on increasing our dividend. And it\u2019s under appreciated in the REIT sector, but if you look at our dividend yield compared to our peer group and you look at our dividend growth in the expectations of a higher dividend growth. We look like a cheap stock, so I mean do what you want with that. I guess I don\u2019t know. Alexander Goldfarb : Well, which as an analyst we can't do anything with it because we can't own it. But obviously it's good to cash dividend checks. Moving over to Europe, you guys announced the JV with HBC in Germany, and it involves a lot of High Street retail. In the U.S. you've shied away from doing High Street retail. You've stuck to the malls and outlets. So just sort of curious, do you have a different view with High Street retail in Europe that you don't share in U.S. or it\u2019s really again just a pure credit play in focusing on retailers, and you're not trying to do something as far as potential to get at High Street retail in Europe. David Simon : Look I think the market in the U.S. with respect to High Street retail is sophisticated expenses, there are lot of guys that have been added for a long-time. We think Europe is a little bit different in that maybe there is more opportunity for us to do that just like the opportunity that we saw with Kl\u00e9pierre at the outset a few years ago. So that\u2019s not to say the HBC thing is a little bit of credit play, it's a little bit accretive to grow vehicle, it\u2019s betting on. I think extremely talented CEO and team in HBC. These guys are entrepreneurs, they are smart, they are sophisticated, they want to grow their business. We are happy and pleased to be their partner and I think that entity ultimately will look to create a broader portfolio. High Street Europe is a little more interesting maybe from evaluation point of view. U.S. is a little more pricey, got a lot more sophisticated players, but we\u2019ll see how it evolves, but we are making I think a good bet where we\u2019ve got very strong partner, strong assets, strong credit and between the two of us that have the nose and instinct for good deals we should find some opportunities. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Listen, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Chao. Vincent Chao : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to the Sears JV. Just curious in the context of investment opportunities, there's a lot of chatter about different retailers doing something with their real estate. Just curious if you are having more conversations with others on structures like the Sears or the HBC deals that you have. David Simon : Well, I think there's got to be more than just marking or financing retailers real estate. So for instance I can just contrast \u2013 the reason we did Sears is because partnered with them is because it\u2019s all about redeveloping over time those boxes. Sears\u2019 store of the future may be part of it, they may not be, but that\u2019s basically a redevelopment play. HBC that contrast it was, yes, they got a mark out with real estate, but to me we created \u2013 if HBC only wanted to just mark the real estate and do credit we wouldn\u2019t have played, we saw an opportunity to bet on a very accomplished entrepreneur great brands and low and behold we did the deal and they are buying the German department store, but we are entering in German real estate in a big way. If it's just marketing real estate or just a credit that\u2019s not really exciting for us. So we\u2019re happy to talk strategically with our retailers about it, but there's got to be more to it than just that. And so I think this world will present opportunities, but there's got to be more than just marketing the real estate whether it's redevelopment or creating a growth vehicle to go do something there's got to be more to it than what is just said. Vincent Chao : That makes sense. But I guess I would just \u2013 it seems like there would be plenty of redevelopment opportunities beyond just Sears, although Sears offers plenty of opportunity in itself, I guess. But maybe just thinking about other areas I mean can you just comment on the McArthurGlen pipeline? I think there's one project that you were expecting to start here this year. But how does the rest of the pipeline look like for potential additional developments there? David Simon : Sure, there is \u2013 in Provence, we are in fact we just bought the land, we are starting construction in September after the growing season, believe it or not, is finished and that\u2019s an all systems go deal, we are in the final throes of expand \u2013 about to start the expansion in Roermond, which we'll be a partner in with other partners in that project. We have pipeline in Normandy, in Spain with \u2013 we are partnering with [Sonali] and we got \u2013 we are looking, we are not quite there, but we\u2019re looking seriously expanding Venice. So I would say it's a very active type in terms of new development and obviously to be able to build starting in September in South of France is very, very exciting, very pleasing. Vincent Chao : Okay. Just one last, one cleanup question in terms of the guidance. Assuming that does not include any future buybacks, just what's closed already? Richard Sokolov : Well, Tom and I had this philosophical discussion today. We are a pretty large company, we are going to earn $10 a share this year thereabouts. We have so many ins and outs, we\u2019re just not a portfolio we\u2019ve got so many things going on. That\u2019s our best guess, we put it all on the blender, we give it you and it\u2019s all subject to change quarter-over-quarter. The good news is we hit our numbers, knock on wood. Hopefully we'll continue. We don\u2019t isolate one particular thing over another and we\u2019ll see where it shakes out. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Carol Kemple. Carol Kemple : Good morning. Richard Sokolov : Good morning. Carol Kemple : At this point with your other department store tenants are you seeing any of them want to right-size space like Sears? David Simon : Not really, we are constantly in conversations with them and we are doing a number of other potential things involving relocating department stores. For example at Stamford we had a Bloomingdale's that was oversized, we worked with them they built a brand new store, and now we\u2019re redeveloping the old Bloomingdale's into small shops. Did the same thing with Saks at Houston Galleria. So it\u2019s a very dynamic process. We\u2019re constantly in conversation with them, and we\u2019re doing a lot of things as a result of that. But there is not another store out there that has the kind of focused, programmatic approach to decreasing their footprint size. Carol Kemple : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Mueller. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Just going back to Sears again, what's a rough idea of the dollars that could be invested in those 10 or 11 boxes over time? Richard Sokolov : I think we\u2019re going to use that on a project by project basis but obviously as we\u2019ve articulated, it\u2019s a substantial opportunity and it would certainly be in a larger amount as opposed to a lesser amount. But it depends on the scope of the individual projects, but that is to come. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. So it sounds like it could be in the couple - in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Richard Sokolov : Potentially, yes. Michael Mueller : Got it. Then I guess, how does it work? If you demolish a Sears box and do a major expansion well beyond the footprint, do they participate in that? Or is it just to the scope of the footprint? Richard Sokolov : Each project is differently. But in the Sears venture, they own a part of the Seritage, our venture owns a parcel of land. So the venture would be focusing its redevelopment efforts on the parcel of land that is owned in the venture. And that would be the extent of the activity in the venture. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. Just quick question on occupancy and the impact of bankruptcies from earlier in the year. I think we were pretty happily surprised to see that your second-quarter occupancy and same-store NOI were actually somewhat stronger than the first quarter. I was just wondering if you could go through some of the progress on re-leasing that space and when you expect to have made up for the lost occupancy and NOI. David Simon : I will just say our goal we are going to \u2013 we still think we will come close to our year end occupancy of last year, but its going to be - its not a no-brainer. It could slip what I\u2019d say immaterially, but others may have a different view of that, so I respect that. But we\u2019re trending up we are making progress, and I think we\u2019ve got momentum but it takes time. So our goal is still try to get back to last year. But we lost, what Rick? Richard Sokolov : 940,000 David Simon : Yes, 940,000 feet, so that\u2019s a lot of work. So we are little bit on the treadmill, but we're a fit athlete and we're running... Richard Sokolov : David is speaking for himself. David Simon : I wish. Richard Sokolov : I would just add one thing that we are making very good progress going through it and it is an opportunity its hard work it has the short-term impact but the tenants that we are brining in are certainly higher productivity tenants from the sales perspective and so far the rents that we\u2019ve been able to generate or in excess of the rents that we are being paid by the former tenants that when bankrupt. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Then just also is there anything you could say on the difference you're seeing in re-leasing the space at, say, your trophy properties versus whatever you would call the next tier, and the next tier of your properties? Richard Sokolov : Look, it's axiomatic that the higher-productivity properties have a broader band of interest, but that\u2019s what we do and happily we're also blessed with a portfolio that is predominantly those strong properties. Caitlin Burrows : Great. Okay, thank you. David Simon : You are welcome. Operator : Our next comes from Linda Tsai. Linda Tsai : Hi. I'm not sure if this is something you could comment on deeply, but when you look at your redevelopment plans for Sears, do you think you're approaching your plans any differently from GGP or Macerich? Or is it relatively straightforward in terms of figuring out what the property is missing and splitting boxes and adding entertainment? David Simon : Look, I think they\u2019re very \u2013 they are both very confident developers, redevelopers. So at the end of the day my guess is it\u2019s not going to be all that crazily different. But it\u2019s so much of that dependent upon the location and the local market, but they\u2019re both confident developers. I would probably venture to say it will be similar, but if they are better than us we intend to copy immediately, okay. Linda Tsai : Then retail is cyclical and while there's been a recent wave of closures you also noted that there's also a lot of entrepreneurial concepts popping up. Do you think there's anything different about the cycle time around as it relates to maybe omnichannel selling or bifurcation amongst brands catering to high-end or low-end consumers? David Simon : Well, look would you say generally there is obviously the whole movement towards value on one hand and luxury on the other continues. The general \u2013 the good news about that is we\u2019re positioned in both of those barbells extremely well. But that\u2019s not to say people lose sight of that, that's not to say the middle American mall isn't doing well. Its part of the community, it\u2019s ignored from a media point of view, there's assumptions made about those assets, there is extrapolation because one mall went out of business that all malls are going out of business. But I would say to you that the solid middle malls throughout America continue to do well, serve their purpose. But you\u2019ll clearly see a movement in a lot of retailers from either aspirational higher end goods or value. There is no question about that. Richard Sokolov : One comment I would make to you on the new retailers we are dealing with is that they are substantially more sophisticated than the crop of new retailers we dealt with say 10 years ago, better financed, much more focused on their niche and it\u2019s been much easier to deal this new crop of entrepreneurs than might have been the case. David Simon : Look in today's world we\u2019ll have to be better, we\u2019ll have to be on our game better. So that comes with \u2013 okay what industry it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s say I mean everybody, the rapid changes in the world is putting pressure on every industry, every operator and that\u2019s why you got a strong, people, strong assets and strong balance sheet to deal with it all. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. Rick, if you look at kind of the sales and leasing trends, is there anything that you can talk about regionally? Any big differences that you see? Richard Sokolov : Look, there are a couple of differences across the thing in our business. The Great Lakes, Southeast and Pacific are stronger; mountain and New England were a little weaker. The better categories were home furniture, food, personal care, jewelry, and athletic shoes. Steve Sakwa : Okay. David Simon : I mean, I say Steve you clearly \u2013 the stronger dollar and the economic upheavals in growing markets, but with wealthy people Brazil, what's going on with China and their focus on obviously Europe with the stronger dollar. I mean it has impacted sales in the high tourist centers and we\u2019ve got them. I mean there is no question. We've got them in South Florida. We've got them in Orlando. We don't have New York City, we have Woodbury which is been relatively flat and that's usually a center that grows every year I think that\u2019s more of all the stuff going on with the center and the tourism, but the tourism centers have had a little softness you see in the hotel industry. So we are not immune to that. Steve Sakwa : I presume that's not having much of an impact on leasing, just given their long-term nature. Or do you actually think it's impacting leasing at all? Richard Sokolov : I would say it had no impact on leasing. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then, David, any just update kind of the Copley kind of residential project? David Simon : Well, I mentioned it briefly earlier which is look we\u2019re doing the Southwest Corridor. We\u2019re finalizing the permit and there which is more administrator. So it is all shaping up to, we start to dig down to support the foundation going up that's all moving should start the Southwest Corridor should start in the next month. So we have certain fail safe, the way that building is being constructed we have fail safes so for instance we are going to do the Southwest Corridor first which is because we\u2019ve got to create a new entrants to create the way to build. We have to go down into the Turnpike so we have to create new entrance first. That\u2019s happening, that\u2019s been approved by us then we go down into the Turnpike then we go up to support this field going up. So we will be making that incremental decision, but once we do the Southwest, we will do that. And then building the podium is where it's really guts poker that\u2019s a year decision from now, but all systems are go and we are cranking, we don\u2019t see any reason to stop. So we \u2013 the kind of nice thing about this is that we can stop looking this for the market a year from now and yes we would have an investment in it, but we\u2019ll always be able to go up. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't go up, but we are certainly going to go down and build our way up to create the platform to build the power. Steve Sakwa : Okay and then just last question. Anything on Deliv? That kind of system just seems to have taken a backseat. Haven't heard much about it. Any thoughts about that or how it's working or\u2026? David Simon : I would comment on Deliv that Macy's just recently announced that they are expanding the footprint of stores in which Deliv is going to be working with them. So that is certainly a positive sign and we continue to believe that there is a significant role for all of our properties to play in the fulfillment aspect of an omnichannel retail business, and it's moving a pace. Steve Sakwa : So Rick, do you think it\u2019s more a function of just consumers not really realizing it exists to kind of get more critical mass? Richard Sokolov : I think it\u2019s just the function of getting the systems right, getting the retail so the point were they are ready to fulfill from their store that there is a big systems upgrade it\u2019s going on right now across the entire industry. And ultimately there is going to be a seamless integrated experience for our consumers and certainly fulfilling from the store to their home has going to be part of that and Deliv can be part of that solution. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from DJ Busch. DJ Busch : Thank you. Just one quick follow-up on Sears. Given the potential size of the capital spend for some of the Sears projects that you were talking about earlier, if Seritage can't meet its share of the capital requirements, is there an opportunity for you to put up a disproportionate amount of the capital to potentially grow your interest in the joint venture? David Simon : Well, that have to be a negotiated \u2013 that would have to be a negotiated part of the deal, but it seems to me they have got the balance sheet to be able to do that, but I\u2019m sure we could figure it out as they didn\u2019t. DJ Busch : But is it correct to assume you guys are controlling kind of the process and the strategies at each of the center? Richard Sokolov : We\u2019re joint venture partners, it\u2019s both \u2013 it\u2019s approval on both sides. I\u2019d say we are taking the lead on coming up with the plans and the redevelopment and the different uses. But they are riding copilot with us. David Simon : And I would also say to you that we have significant another number of Sears stores that are not in our venture that are in Seritage. And when we meet with Seritage, we\u2019re actively working with them, as we have done in the past to help them redeploy those phases in a productive way and an example of that is King of Prussia, where Dick's now opened and Primark is opening this fall. And between the two of them they will 100% occupy the former Sears store. DJ Busch : And just a follow up on that, Rick. With Seritage kind of taking control of the Sears space and the talks of other department stores potentially monetizing the real estate, do you see any difference in the operations? I know it's early, but do you see any potential impact to the way you negotiate or lease or deal with the anchors if the landlord is no longer the retailer? Richard Sokolov : No. DJ Busch : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Yes, they don\u2019t have the infrastructure to get stuff done like we do. So I don't see the dynamics changing. DJ Busch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. I know most of the conversations are always circling around upgrading quality and reinvesting in your better assets. But given that you do have some of your walls tied into WPG and the history there, and just because the stock price has gotten cheaper over the past year, is there a certain point where a lower-quality portfolio might look interesting just because it's so cheap? Or should we just basically consider this like a permanent divorce? David Simon : I don't know even how to interpret your question. We spun off WPG well over a year ago. They are separate independent company, they are focused on the strip center and the B mall business. You can hear that directly from them, we do services for them that ultimately will go away mid next year and their growth opportunities are better discussed with them. I think our focus as you seen over the years, is to buy the bigger assets or assets that we feel we can improve upon, but the primary focus is on our redevelopment or finding different vehicles for growth, whether its Europe, whether its HBC et cetera and continue to grow our business. I said the amount of the big deal business we are not going to buy B assets I think that\u2019s better for others to do given what\u2019s on our plate, but I\u2019m not sure I answered the question, but I tried. Ki Bin Kim : Yes, you kind of did. I was just basically asking if there's a certain price where something like that would be interesting again? David Simon : I think that this is better for others to do, but that\u2019s not up to me to. Ki Bin Kim : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Moore. Rich Moore : Hey, guys. Good morning. My question, David, was kind of on the flip side of that. You have 200 assets. If you rank them all, does it make sense to get rid of 190 through 200? That kind of thing? David Simon : Well, we are always doing that, we just do it \u2013 we don\u2019t do it ahead of that so we have a deal that\u2019s closing mid-August that was a lot work and we just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. We are closed on another deal so we do that all. Rich, I know if you looked at our history sold a bunch of stuff so what we get, we\u2019ll always sell assets, always part of\u2026 Rich Moore : Okay, so are you marketing things actively, or is it just sort of an opportunistic? Yes? Okay. David Simon : Yes. We market. We've marketed - the two that I am referring to were marketed, yes. Rich Moore : Got it. Okay. Then on the lease term income you guys got this quarter, it was kind of big. I'm curious; I know you can't tell each quarter what's going to happen. But is that something that's going to pick up here you think in the last two quarters of the year? Are there more discussions you're having on this kind of thing? David Simon : There could be a few deals here or there. But if you look at it year-over-year, year-to-date it\u2019s not all that different 2014. So it\u2019s lumpy towards lumpy but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be all that different, Steve right? From Steven Broadwater : But the same as 2014. David Simon : Same as 2014 that\u2019s the business that\u2019s lumpy in terms of quarter-to-quarter it actually relatively consistent year-over-year. Rich Moore : Okay great. Thanks guys. End of Q& A Operator : I would now like to turn the call over to David for closing remarks. David Simon : Okay thank you. Have a wonderful last few weeks to summer. Sorry to have ruined your Friday on a summer Friday. Enjoy. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. And you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

David Simon : Good morning, we had a productive quarter. We opened started and completed several new projects and closed our joint venture with HBC including the acquisition of certain cop-op department store which will serve as another avenue of growth for us. And most importantly we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.54 per share which exceeded the first call consensus by $0.07. These results were achieved even with the negative impact of $0.04 in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter due to the strong dollar. On a comparable basis excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the prior year period FFO per diluted share increased 12.9% or $0.29 year-over-year. Key metrics, occupancy was 96.1%. Leasing activity remains healthy. The malls and outlets recorded releasing spreads of $11 per square foot, an increase of 18.4%. Comp NOI increased 4.3% in the third quarter of 2015, an increase 3.8% year-to-date keeping us on track for full year guidance of 4% comp NOI growth. This is on top of our industry leading growth of more than 5% in 2014. As a reminder we do not include lease settlement income in comp NOI disclosure or new transaction. We also do not include the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers. Total sales across the portfolio increased 1.8% for the trailing 12 months even with the loss of bankrupt tenants. On a comparable basis the sales per square foot increased for the 12 months ended September 30 was 2.7% positive. They were strong in the mall, but effective in the outlet business due to the strong dollar as had on sales activity from the international tourist in property zone; the Canadian, Mexican borders as well as traditional tourist markets. At the end of the third quarter redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing at thirty properties across all three of our platforms with a total committed spend of $1.7 billion. During the quarter we opened significant expansion at two of the country's most productive outlet centers, San Francisco premium outlet centers and Chicago Premium Outlets. Following the expansion the outlets in Chicago and San Francisco are the largest respectively. In Illinois and California we have recently opened the Fashion Wing at Del Amo. The Wing includes a new Nordstrom, and more than a hundred exceptional brands, many of them exclusive to the trade area. With this transformation we have completed Del Amo is just another example how we continue invest in our proven assets to enrich the shoppers experience and enhance the value of our real estate. We have started construction on several new strategic projects during the quarter including significant redevelopments at the shops of Riverside, the Westchester and our progress is excellent with our Sears boxes at Seritage. As we move forward, construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects. Some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, The Galleria and Houston Stanford Shopping Center, the King of Prussia Mall, Sawgrass Mills and Woodbury Commons; all of these projects we expect to be completed over the next 12 months. In terms of new development, we opened two new in the quarter, Vancouver and Gloucester. We also opened Tucson Premium Outlets on October 01. And we are opening Tampa on Thursday of this week. During the quarter we started construction on a new premium outlet center in Clarksburg which is projected to open in October 2016. We are also with our partner McArthurGlen. We started construction on a new outlet and Provouge Spranz which is scheduled to open in March of 2017 which will be the only designer outlet in the south of France. And our share of investment at new outlets in full price is currently 725 million not including the recently completed Gloucester and Vancouver. And let's talk quickly about the balance sheet activities. We issued $1.1 billion of new notes with the weighted average duration of 7.8 years and an average coupon of 3.05%. We completed several secured placements during the quarter as well as the U.S. and German loan facility financings for a joint venture with HBC. Our current liquidity between the revolvers and cash on hand is approximately 6 billion. Our industry leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us in a very positive manner. We exercised caution during the third quarter with respect to our common stock repurchase program and did not repurchase any stock during the period due to the increased market volatility and the dislocation in the debt markets. We remain committed to our buyback efforts, of course subject to marking into conditions. In addition, we announced our dividend of $1.60 per share for this quarter. That's an increase of 23% year-over-year and in fact that's the fourth consecutive quarter that we've increased our dividend. We will pay $6.05 in 2015 and that's an increase of 17.5% compared to $5.15 of last year. So with all that said, no one is as active as we are in terms of redevelopment and new development. And I'm pleased, based upon the performance to date. Once again we raise our guidance of 2015 of $10.10 to $10.15 per share. This compares to our original FFO guidance of 9.60 to 9.70 per share or approximately $0.48 higher from the respective midpoints. We are now ready for question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead sir. You are live into the call. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Christine Kilroy. David, your comment about the stock buyback, being I guess it's a volatile stock market and some uncertainties in the debt markets; isn't that exactly the time where you should be exercising your fortress balance sheet and significant cash proceeds to be able to buy the stock. I know high insight is 2020, watching the stock go up $27 but I'm just curious about the mentality at that point in time about not being aggressive at that point. David Simon : Well, Michael I think stock buybacks, in terms of the marketplace reaction to the may be overstated. What I'm most interested in at this company is growing our earnings and our dividend and maintaining our balance sheet, improving our properties and enhancing our relationship. So I don\u2019t look at it quarter by quarter basis. We are more focused on growing our earnings per share and our dividend. And the fact is that in August the market was very volatile as you know the debt markets gapped pretty significantly. We chose for one quarter to be cautious. I have no regrets about that because our number one priority is to grow our earnings and our dividends. And that to me is more important and I think that's what the market should value more importantly than what one's buyback activity may be from one quarter to the next. We remain committed to it while we're going to be opportunistic about that because we continue to believe. I'm terrible at reading from the script. I can barely get the words out. But as you know our activity in redevelopment and new development is not hypothetical. It is ongoing and I think prudence in that category of the buyback is appropriate. And again I think our number one priority is earnings growth and therefore dividend growth. And then buy stock back when we feel like it's a real opportunistic time. Michael Bilerman : And that Christine has a question as well. David Simon : Sure. Christine Kilroy : Hey David, just thinking about the Simon venture Group stuff and we appreciate the in-depth look at that business earlier this month, beyond just sort of the small financial investment you've made, what do you view as the primary benefit of this business to Simon, over the longer term as consumers shopping habits continue to evolve and maybe you can sort of give us a sense of how big you think that your investment in this business could reach over time? David Simon : Well, let me just talk about what I think the goal is, ultimately it's to help connect with the consumer. The mall business is historically as always felt like the, our job was to get the box reach to the right retailers and let the retailers do most of the connecting and driving most of the traffic but I think the industry has a evolved, where we've got to become the driver of traffic and we've got to connect with the consumers. So what I'm looking for in that, those investments and that connection with technology is, how do I connect with the consumer to drive traffic and make their shopping trip more enjoyable or more effective, two: how do I help the retailer do that as well and then maybe third, is there some new concept or new retailer that ultimately can proliferate our portfolio through these kind of connections. And if we can accomplish those two or three goals then I think we will have succeeded. And it's all about trying to take the mall box making a smart connected box to help our retailers and the property owner connect with the consumer so that their trip is better, more efficient and more productive which we think will lead to sales growth. So that's the goal. We may do a little bit here and there that's a little far afield like funding the new retail or restaurant concept because we think maybe that has potential down the road and in terms of size, we're not going to get carried away but it's really hard to pinpoint right now exactly how big that can be but we have a sense where we're kind of, will ultimately be in the mid-20s by the end of this year, maybe we'll do another type of investment like that next year. So it wouldn't shock me if we are in there 50+ range by the end of next year but that's just a swag. Operator : Thank you for your question. We do have another question and it comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead sir, you are live into the call. Jeff Spector : Great, thank you, good morning. I guess, just thinking about the bumps throughout the year, David what exceeded your expectations and how were you thinking about the budgeting process for 2016? I guess can you compare year-over-year, your mindset? David Simon : Well, I think what's interesting before the end perspective, first of all is that as you look at our earnings growth we have had an increase in lease settlement income but we've also had the negative of the currency negative from our foreign operations. If you put the two together over \u201914 we've actually had a negative $0.05 variance. So, the increase in the lease settlement income from \u201915 to \u201914 offset against the reduction in earnings that we've taken from our foreign investments due to the strong dollar, net-net year-to-date has been a negative $0.05. So you have to put that in perspective. We've had good rental growth, good leasing spreads. We are obviously had a lot more bankruptcies in \u201915 than we did in \u201914 and the other impact we've had on the negative side is that we've lost certain amount of percentage rent from the outlet business because of the fact that the strong dollar has also heard tourism shopping and we've seen that impacted more in the outlet business, the outlet tourists centers then we had in the mall business. The mall comp sales have been a better than our expectations and our leading portfolio in terms of that. So the fact is we always though year in and year out, that's what makes us a little bit unique, we always had some positives, we always had some negatives and we somehow manage to hit our numbers, exceed our numbers, produce very strong industry leading results. I'd also say to you as we look into next year, I mean the key focus for us frankly is we have anniversary the stronger dollar. So that will not be, the negative it was this year and the big focus obviously is going to be leasing up the bankrupt tenants were probably 60% to 70% on our way there, a total loss score footage is the [million three]. So we've got our work cut out but we've seen this movie before. The good news is we have quality real estate that allows us to do it and we have other leverages to continue to have industry leading comp growth. And I think the big exciting thing that we've got in \u201916 which won't show up in our numbers, is all of the major redevelopment that we've done between King of Prussia, Roosevelt Field, Stanford, I want Craig to go see Del Amo, it's unbelievable what we've started there, of course we're still finishing it. It's a big complicated projects but we've got Woodbury Common coming on board, we've got the extension of Sawgrass colonnade, new development et cetera is going to be really terrific to open up in the latter half of \u201916 which positions us \u201917. The model is reinvest, generate excess cash flow, pay high dividends and I should, of course remind you that our dividend [indiscernible] was $3 and actually $2.70, it\u2019s $6.05 today , we'll have significant growth in next year as well but we've got to show up and we've got to go work every day. Jeff Spector : Thank you, that's helpful. Good timing on the, yes? David Simon : I hope it answered your question but I'm not, but we've got work to do and we have one thing about comp and alike, if you look at nine, I'm sorry, if you look at \u201913, I don't know 5%, what we have guys 5%, \u201914 we had 5%, this year we are going to have 4%. So we are building it up a pretty strong base and we didn't have any down years of non-performance to build it off, right. So it's great to build also base if you had non-performance but we haven't had that frankly and in the great recession our comp and ally was relatively flat which was industry leading as well. Jeff Spector : No, it's very helpful, thank you and good timing on the Del Amo because I know Craig has put in a request to visit it. David Simon : Come on down. Jeff Spector : Great. And then my only, my one other question was just on your previous comments on the redevelopment pipeline. We believe you've mentioned through \u201917 or you at the point where you think that pipeline could continue a billion plus beyond \u201917? Are we correct on that? David Simon : Yes. I feel pretty good about that. Yes. Jeff Spector : Beyond \u201917 or not yet? David Simon : Yes, no, no. Jeff Spector : Oh beyond? Okay. David Simon : No rest for [indiscernible], so this morning, we're going through our budget cycle now which is a lot of fun but this morning we were going through our capital plan through \u201916 and \u201917 and \u201918. And we don't see it abating, it\u2019s actually in\u201917 it will be higher probably around $1.5 billion, and in\u201918 in that range. And the big unknown is how fast the Seritage things happen. We are not, it\u2019s a joint venture. So it's not just the question of how fast we can go but also how fast Seritage can goes and how fast Sears can go which is clearly we're trying to influence but we don't have complete control in that but we certainly have a lot on the drawing board to do there. Jeff Spector : Great thank you. Operator : Thank you feel question. We do have another question it comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead you are live into the call. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. Earlier this year, mall REITs were of course impacted across the board by retailer bankruptcies but your same-center occupancy was down 80 basis points this quarter which is actually more than the first and second which seems surprising. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about what drove that year-over-year decline in occupancy to remain in the third quarter and how you expect it turn going forward. David Simon : We had more bankruptcies in the third quarter. So, Jones went out, just more bankruptcies and then we've also opened up a few centers which had some decrease. We just saw people understand, we don't, in our statistics we put in new centers. The minute the rent in terms of occupancy or new expanded centers. They're not in our comps, NOI growth but they are in our sales per square foot and they're in our occupancy. So part of that decrease was also that we added some new centers and some new expanded centers which actually drove our occupancy down, [flat plenty depth] as well. Caitlin Burrows : Got it and then like you're mentioning before, you guys have had consistent pretty strong same store NOI growth but do you think that this creates some easy occupancy comp for 2016 and that should be able to help you even more? David Simon : Nothing is easy, if you see my grade here recently. Nothing is easy. Well, I won't say anything about gold but we did read this retail report; we found your list of 100 malls curious, so I assume the real estate folks didn't have much to do with that but we're happy to help you. Caitlin Burrows : It will. Our retail team that put it together. David Simon : Right and you quoted traffic statistics which I would encourage you read the footnotes from your source. Caitlin Burrows : We will do. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Happy to help. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord, please go ahead. Paul Morgan : Good morning. Just on the sales trends, I mean could you talk a little bit about it, I mean whether and to what extent the tourist markets were drag due to the dollar or maybe looking at any differences between the Mall and the premium outlet portfolio. David Simon : We're not going to run from this. We're just going to tell you reality. We have unbelievable tourist centers. In our outlet business, Orlando, Woodberry, throughout Las Vegas and those generate a lot of tourism dollars and the tourists because of the strong dollar, you know was quiet. The high end luxury retail market in say New York City and Miami has been hurt as well and we saw that have an usually, it has very little impact but we saw that a little bit more in the outlet business and very little in the mall business. We think it's more or less temporary these are great assets, has no impact on retail demand and we've seen a space that comp NOI growth but that\u2019s why the sales metrics are a bigger reaction from you than they are from me, but we tell like it is. So they had an impact on our retail sales per square foot but we don't think it's going to have an impact on our ability to continue to grow comp NOI growth. Paul Morgan : Okay that give some other question I guess which is just, if you look at the public retailers a lot of them or at least stocks have gotten hit pretty hard over the past several months and as we head into the holidays I mean as you talk to them engage with them about, they're open to buys for next year. I mean how is their sentiment? Is it been shifting at all? Is this just kind of sort of the shift in market share between different retailers or is there anything more kind of systematic in terms of, maybe how they're approaching their growth over the next year or two? David Simon : I'd say this, it\u2019s retail dependent but they are better retailers who are dealing with the stronger dollar which has it short term impact on them and second, the fact is our GDP growth is anemic I mean we are growing our general economy 2% below, I think retail can\u2019t avoid that fact. The good news is we outperform not because we cater to generally the better consumer and what I think we've seen from the better consumer this year is a little bit move toward which happens in cycles, a little bit more toward durable goods than non-durable goods which has the impact of making kind of a flattish comp sales growth increase but like I said the mall business, we had very strong comp NOI, I'm sorry comp sales, retail sales growth this year and which was offset as I said only by the tourist centers in the outlet business. So net-net we are up 2.7 but if I isolated just the mall, we'd be up much higher than that and that is a testament even though in the anemic GDP growth the better consumer is spending even though there's been a significant increase in durable goods purchases but retail right now is generally a challenge but we're producing results and we intend to continue to do that. Paul Morgan : I mean would you Would you say it kind of hasn't translated into a meaningful shift in the appetite for space in your centers as people talk about next year? David Simon : Not really. I think the opportunity to growth their business in good real estate for better retailers is strong and I don't see the current environment affecting that. Paul Morgan : Great. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Please go ahead. Ross Nussbaum : I am here with Jeremy Metz. Hey David, when we met the other day, you talked a little bit about the amount of money that consumers are spending in your mall for every minute they are there saying there's like a one-to-one ratio, I am curious if you've done any work to think about spending of millennials and teens versus say their parents to sort of further dig into whether the impact of the internet and technology is going to be a growing problem just from a generational perspective? David Simon : I don't have in front of me but yes we've looked at, you know the typical generational gaps, that you would see Baby Boomers Generation X and so on, yes I don't have that in front of me but those numbers are-- it's not it's not what you think it. I mean in other words, there was not a big differential between Generation X and millennials. The one thing we're starting to see is the Baby Boomers probably more of a trend on their decreased expenditures than anything else. Again, I think the millennials offer great opportunity for us because they're looking for, they are generally going through their increased income opportunity over the next decade. It's a huge population base, greater than even the Baby Boomers. These folks will get married. They will have children. They will move out of urban environments, especially with, the more difficult living conditions that's going on a lot of urban environments. They are, we believe loyal mall shopping consumers. And we're making the mall generally a better experience for them to be at. So I don't think there's a big differential. I don't have the numbers in front of me. It did grew up in the mall environment. They're comfortable with the mall environment. And as their income grows and as they aged and have kids, I think they'll be loyal mall shoppers, especially given the environment we're creating. Ross Nussbaum : I appreciate that. I think Jeremy has got a question as well. David Simon : Sure. Jeremy Metz : Just two quick ones. In terms of the lease cancellation income, it was the high suspend long time. David, earlier you mentioned Jones. I was just wondering if there is any other tenants in particular to maybe drove, I think Forever 21 was in a few supersized locations. They were looking to downsize, not sure if they were a part of it this quarter? David Simon : No Forever 21. It\u2019s basically, the big one was Jones. There were couple of others that year to date that we dealt with but I hate going through retail. Retailers on that it's somewhat confidential. The good news is lease settlement income does have been slow, the good news is that it's not any time we do that we still have this space. So if I get three years of rent and then I get the chance to lease the space back again, I mean that\u2019s a good business, there is nothing wrong with that and to put the earnings in perspective I mean may not have caught the original response to the earlier question, net-net when I look at the stronger dollar from our foreign investments versus the increase in a lease settlement income from \u201914 to \u201915. I'm in the whole $0.05 year to date. So please keep that mind as you think about our business. Jeremy Metz : And then just switching gears quickly, Highwoods recently announced they were looking to sell Country Club Plaza. I was just wondering is that something Simon would be interested in or any thoughts on where that process is at? David Simon : I understand that there is a process. I think it's a good real estate. It's got a good position and it's marketplace. But beyond that I am not informed in terms of numbers or anything else or profit but I understand there's a process and it's always been very good real estate, good market. Jeremy Metz : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning. Just may be sticking with leasing, I'm just curious, David, do you think the increase in lease settlement income you are getting foreshadows potentially more space coming back to you guys after the holiday season through bankruptcy? David Simon : I actually think it\u2019s tailing down. As I look at what generated the list it\u2019s a couple of odd things and our watch-list is actually the guys that we were worried about is kind of happened and done that. So it's out there it's possible but I actually think next year it will be less, it will be less impacted by bankruptcies than we were this year. Jeff Donnelly : Okay and switching gears, I'm just curious for your take is Macerich has taken to joint venturing some assets at a low to mid four cap rate that we've been told are fairly middle of the pack for them. Does that pricing in the market maybe lead you to feel there might be pockets of your portfolio where you are open to JVs or even selling out of some assets entirely to expand your repurchase initiatives? David Simon : I don\u2019t really, I want to rephrase it. I only want to comment on what may switch did so. Jeff Donnelly : I'm just curious as a comp for transactions in the market, does something in the 4s compel you to say, gee, maybe you'd look at selling your assets to fuel repurchases? David Simon : I don't know. I mean the fact to the matter is where we are very comfortable with what we're doing. We sell our assets, there generally is complexity when you go to joint ventures. We like to do joint ventures when there's new opportunities because there is, it's easier to justify. So for instance, just to take a few with that, we're pleased to be part of a new joint ventures on a couple of the new developments, like Brickell and Clearfork, very good partners. Great real estate. That was the only way we could do that. I like those kind of joint ventures where it's more new opportunity than otherwise we sell assets, we sold a bunch of assets, don't forget we did a significant spin off of our strip centers in our smaller malls. I don't I don't rule it out. I don't think we necessarily, it's not our priority to do. The priority for us is to grow our innings, grow our dividend, execute our redevelopment development pipeline. And we have the buyback and I don't think we necessarily need the capital from existing properties in terms of a joint venture that execute on the buyback. Jeff Donnelly : Speaking of JVs, I guess you teamed up with Hudson Bay to acquire, was it Galeria Kaufhof Stores? What can you tell us about those properties and just maybe what are your plans of those locations down the road? David Simon : Well, it's great. Mostly city center real estate in Germany, which is a very strong market, very little retail space per capita as compared to the U.S. as an example. It's got built in growth even if it just stays kind of the credit lease that it is but we think there is some ability to redevelop some of the stores take back some of the front edge, much like we are doing with some of the department stores here in the U.S. And it's a strong cash flow business appropriately valued with some redevelopment upside. Operator : Thank you for your question. We do have another question and it comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just going back to your retailer watch list comments, last year when we had RadioShack, Wet Seal and Deb Shops and Delia's and some others, how early did you have a read into that they would go BK overall? David Simon : Those particular ones? Ki Bin Kim : In general. I was just curious how much of an early warning sign does the watch list provide to you? David Simon : Pretty early. Richard Sokolov : We certainly can see this coming a long way away based on the trends of what their leasing activity is or sales activity, when they probably reported they are looking for new equity, so none of these are surprises but as David said the ones that want to away, they had been on the ropes for years and years and they just ultimately ran out of the incremental equity sources and out of file. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Maybe if you could put it in an easily digestible number. You mentioned 1.3 million square feet that was impacted this year. In broad numbers, what does that look like next year? Richard Sokolov : It\u2019s hard to predict what next year is going to be but as David said we anticipate that the next year will certainly not be as large year on bankruptcies as we had this year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao : I know we spent quite a bit of time on the impact of the dollar and tourism sales, but just curious if you could maybe give some more specific color about Miami and then specifically Brickell Center. David Simon : Well, Miami is feeling some of the heat from obviously Latin America but actually the leasings at Brickell. Richard Sokolov : Brickell is doing very well. It's opening fall of next year. We've been announcing periodically the tenants that are starting up with the wonderful mix of designer tenants and restaurants and it is anchored by Saks with the Cinema. And if you have been down there, it's a very incredible project with two condo towers, the East Hotel and two office buildings in addition to the retail in a market that is really the financial center of that market. So we're very excited about it going forward. Vincent Chao : Okay, so safe to say no impact on demand despite some of the maybe tourism impacts in the near-term, so similar to your comments for the other overall. David Simon : I think what I said earlier is consistent with that retailers. Now look, that's going to attract the better long term thinking retailers. So the fact that tourism is a little soft right now; doesn't detract the better retailer. When I say better, I'm not just talking mix, but just they're better retailers. So I was just trying to explain to you, what's been reported in our sales per square foot but I also made the comment to you, I don't think that is going to detract from the demand of our real estate and our ability to drive comp NOI because we're going after the better retailers. And the better retailers will work through a quarter or two of sales volatility for whatever reason. And that's the point I've been trying to make to a lot of folks a lot of time over retail sales. Retail sales is interesting, but not a predictor comp NOI growth and we've done all sorts of regression analysis. I've talked about this ad nauseam, but we report the facts for you to have, but it doesn't detract from the ability to generate increased cash flow, because that's more supply and demand oriented and what the market rent of our space rolling over is, and what that particular location is, and we got a good space and a good mall, you're going to be there to generate, given that rent will lower, that rent has been there for seven years. You go look at where that rent was rolling over seven years ago. So and that's why we are re-leasing spreads of 11 bucks a foot. That's the focus. The volatility of retail sales is more interesting from a retailer point of view less from the landlord. So, take New York City street retail. There is volatility in that retail sales there but has the market value of that real estate changed. Probably if you talk to a lot of people, they would probably tell you, no. Operator : We have another question from the line of Mike Muller from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Mueller : A couple of questions here. One, you may have indirectly answered before but what was your share of the lease term that you booked this quarter? David Simon : It\u2019s in our supplemental. Michael Mueller : The share of it is because I thought that was the consolidated amount? David Simon : Well, if it is consolidated, that's our share. We may have a little minority interest in that. But if it is consolidated, it's our share, right? Michael Mueller : And then secondly on the outlet development side, can you talk a little bit about the returns you are seeing when you compare Europe starts to US to Asia and how you think about the pecking order of opportunities? David Simon : I would say that the due development in Europe tends to be a little lower than -- our developments here around a 11% return on cost generally. In Europe they may be a touch lower, say 8 or 9 to start with. And in Asia we really don\u2019t do unless they are double digits because you got tax impact and we want a better risk adjusted return. I would say they are probably around the 12% or 13% range. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And I guess as you are thinking about opportunities going forward, is it more skewed towards the US for new starts at this point or do you think you're going to see a little bit more pickup in Europe? David Simon : Europe, like I said, we're really excited on the Provence deal, 90% of it's -- it's a big project and a big market that hasn\u2019t seen a quality outlet like that. So that's good news. There are two or three others through McArthurGlen that were making good progress, and one in Spain that we hope to start construction in '16, as we go through the permitting. So that's up there as well. Another one in the western part of Paris that we are making good progress on, other one in Belgium where we are making good progress on. And in Asia, we've got two or three others that are a little more difficult to predict but we've got our second one in Malaysia that we\u2019re confident that we will get started as well as Mexico. In Mexico we expect to start one next year as well. So we're making progress. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead. Carol Kemple : How does your volume of temporary and pop-up tenants for this holiday season compare to the recent past? And then historically do you know what rate of those tenants convert to a longer-term lease once their temporary lease expires? David Simon : The pop-up, generally, they don\u2019t convert -- the main pop-ups to decide whether they want to do a longer term deal. But I would say, generally there is an increase this year, primarily because we have a little bit more space from the bankruptcies that we've had this year. But Carol, just to remind you, we don\u2019t include that in our occupancy. It's got to be a year in that, but there will be more activity in pop-up stores for the season just because now we have got a little bit more vacancy due to some of the bankruptcies. Carol Kemple : And I was thinking of your American Girl Store that's open in Castleton, I've seen where they are basically doing that to test the Indianapolis market. Are you seeing more retailers not just doing a pop-up store for the season but more so to actually test the market? David Simon : You are starting to see a little bit more of that. I think that's safe to say. Operator : We do have another question that comes from the line of Ryan Peterson from Sandler O'Neill, please go ahead. Ryan Peterson : I just wanted to ask about the Houston Galleria and the Houston market and if you guys have seen any change in the shopper demographics there or the retail sales trends more generally and what your expectations are going forward? David Simon : In what sense? Ryan Peterson : Just whether you think that Houston will be hit, whether retail is kind of the second impact of oil prices there? David Simon : Our Galleria is such a great asset. It tends to -- it's kind of the unambiguous number one. For market of that size, it's kind of unambiguous number one shopping center. So it tends to whether any economic downturn generally, but I will say this. Our retailers are not immune to a little bit of a down economy and Houston is also a big tourist market for the Mexican nationals. So there might be some slight sales, retail sales impact. But it will have no impact to the long term great asset that Houston Galleria is as well as we're doing a significant amount of transformation of that asset with the new Saks store, the new Saks Wing, the new Webster's which is going to open in the next thirty days or so. We have a lot of phenomenal stuff going on there, but sure because retail sales be marginally impacted there. Sure, but Houston Galleria tends to continue to way outperform just because it's such a great asset. Rick I don't know if you want to add anything. Richard Sokolov : I think it is very well positioned and as David said, it's got the unique mix of anchors, restaurants and small shops in that market and it's been very enduring over cycles in the energy belt for decades. And if anything, well I think Houston generally has become less of a -- I would certainly say twenty plus years ago, was more boom bust. But with the medical, it's with the universities, the medical facilities there, it's much more diversified economy than just oil and gas. Operator : We do have another question that comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Just two quick questions. I know you've talked a bit about the weakness in the US and all that business. But just what about stuff north of the border, south of the border? Just how kind of are the international assets performing? David Simon : I'm sorry I didn't hear your first part. Steve Sakwa : Sorry, is that better? David Simon : Yes that's better thanks. Steve Sakwa : I know you've talked about the weakness in the tourism markets for the outlet business here in the US. I'm just curious how the assets in Canada, Mexico, over in Japan, the few that you have over in Europe, how are the non-US ones performing from a sales and leasing Perspective? David Simon : Again I don't want to overreact. I mean there is a little bit of softness due to the strong dollar U.S. tourism. You're seeing that in all sorts of businesses, hotel business whatever, maybe we are dealing with it. But the fact is the international properties are actually performing very-very well. Europe retail sales is actually relatively impressive, in the Klepierre portfolio, the outlet sales that we have with McArthurGlen are very impressive. Japan, you see that's in our 8-K. They are very impressive, up about 7%. Korea, a little bit soft, I think the only market that's a little soft is Korea, a little bit because they are not the stars, but whatever the last version was. Mars whatever and the Chinese consumer they're probably going a little bit less to Korea for the time being. But I would say Mexico sales are, we've go one asset. Canada is great. Toronto is terrific. Montreal is finding its market increasing. So generally those centers are very-very, we've been very pleased with those results. Steve Sakwa : And I guess the second question, you sort of briefly touched on Klepierre. I didn't really hear much on the call but just how has the integration gone? If you had to kind of rank on a scale of 1 to 10 of just all the things you want to do, where are you guys in the process of transforming the combined company? David Simon : You mean with respect to Corio? Steve Sakwa : Yes Klepierre Corio and just kind of overall business [multiple speakers]. David Simon : I just want to -- look, they brought Corio, we don\u2019t know and then so we are not integrating with them. I just wanted to distinguish. I would say, look, they've gone, over the three years we've owned it, they have done a lot of transformation, selling a bunch of stuff, buying a bunch of stuff. That's pretty much packed them. The big focus next year is really operationally which they through osmosis or improving their capabilities of doing that, and that's been the big focus, I'd say in '16. Now that the integration with Corio was pretty much done. The sale of the big Carrefour portfolio was done and so I think it's going to be an operational story. But we are not operating the business, we're providing strategic input and I think they've done a very good job of gleaming whatever nuggets of strategy we are able to impart and ignoring the ones that have no value. What, sometimes we don\u2019t have the right strategy. So they are doing a good job. But I think operationally there is, I would say they are the first to admit, they can continue to improve just like we can. And I think that's a big focus for them in the upcoming years. But we are not integrating. I they are running their business. Steve Sakwa : No-no, I understand that. I'm just saying sitting as Chairman you kind of can sit at the top and look at what they are executing strategically and just trying to figure out how much of the playbook has been done and how much is left to do? David Simon : Well, there is always a gap in terms of how we might do things versus how they do things there. I still think there is room where they could be operationally better and that will take longer for them to achieve, but I am confident that they will get better. And we will help out as much as we can. They are pretty good and they are doing a good job. Operator : The next question comes from the line of DJ Busch from Green Street Advisors , please go ahead. DJ Busch : Just a quick follow-up on the Hudson Bay partnership. Is the opportunity set to do deals like a Kaufhof greater abroad versus here in the States? I guess how do you see that investment growing from a geographic perspective? David Simon : I do think perhaps the international business may offer a few more opportunities, but they are very creative folks along with our resources dedicated to it, so I wouldn\u2019t rule out domestic opportunities but I would say maybe marginally more opportunities internationally than here. But I wouldn\u2019t rule out domestic opportunities as well. DJ Busch : And then is the joint venture open to kind of retail leaseback opportunities outside of the traditional department stores as well? David Simon : Yes. DJ Busch : Okay. And not to belabor the point on international, the softness in international tourism, but the mills operating metrics were pretty impressive again. I think those are obviously greatly influenced by Sawgrass. Is that similar to your comments on the Galleria? Is Sawgrass one of those assets that kind of bucks the trend? David Simon : Yes. But we did feel a little bit of softness there as well. So all of these asset is about to trend, but they might have again the retail sales, not the cash flow may have some short term impact. But Sawgrass had a little bit of softness as well. It is not immune. Operator : Thank you for that. We have no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the call over to David Simon, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks. David Simon : Thank you so much and we will talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect.",

David Simon : Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a great year. We opened, started, and completed several new development and redevelopment projects. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, extending our average term and reducing our weighted interest cost. We continued to achieve strong operating and financial results. Our full-year 2015 FFO per share was $9.86 which peaked our initial guidance range of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, even with a net $0.11 loss reported during the year which was derived from $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by $0.22 gain on the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the year, as well as $0.12 negative impact from foreign currency devaluations. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact from WPG spin-off in the prior year, and the net loss mentioned above, full-year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share. We posted record FFO results once again and have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 14% over the last five years. For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter, FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year. Now, let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.1%. This was 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014, due to the timing of lease up of more 2 million square feet of new space we brought online this year from expansions and new developments, as well as replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space lost due to tenant bankruptcies during the year. Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we brought online this year. The timing of the lease up on the remaining space to be leased impacted our year-end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points. By the end of the year we replaced more than 70% of the space loss to tenant bankruptcies and the remaining space to be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the two together, and that's a 100 basis point differential. Leasing activity remained healthy as evidenced by the Mall and Premium Outlets reported leasing spread of $10.62 per foot, an increase of 18%, and the base minimum rent was $48.96 which was up more than 4% compared to last year reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations. As I mentioned retailer demand per space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business were adding brand extensions, and creating new brands, and pure-play retailers want physical locations to increase their revenues. Retailers who opened bricks-and-mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site traffic and lower customer acquisition cost. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market. When the retailer opens a physical store in a market they see their online sales increase, and likewise, if they close the store they see their online sales in that market decline. Successful omnichannel retailers are increasing their buy online and pickup in store. This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers, but also facilitates incremental purchases and upsell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment. For 2015, sales per square foot for our Mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619 a foot. Comparable sales per square foot for the Malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at the Mills and we were down slightly at our tourist oriented premium outlets, and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers. We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and is the envy of the industry. The strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales as these unique centers which negatively affected our overage rent for the quarter. I know you've all heard about mall traffic decreases. But let me give you some facts based on our internal data across the largest retail portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our Malls was flat for the year including the Holiday season, traffic at our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more than 2% for the holidays, and traffic at the Mills increased slightly for the year as well. Comp NOI increased 3.7% for the full-year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned already at our tourist oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis points. I will strongly remind you we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions, or the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOIs -- in our comp NOI number. Total NOI from our consolidated and unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014 and this includes any NOI contribution from Kle'pierre. Now let me quickly talk as we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion. At the end of the fourth quarter, but I'll give you some highlights, at the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all three of our platforms, with a total committed spend of $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we opened two significant expansions and completed number of other strategic redevelopments, including the new Fashion Wing at Del Amo which includes the new Nordstrom and more than 100 exceptional brands, expansion of The Colonnade Sawgrass where we added 20 small shops, very high-end small shops and two restaurants, and the redevelopment at Phipps, Woodfield Mall, and Menlo Park. We also started construction on several new projects during the quarter, including The Shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia, Woodbury Commons, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in '16 and Houston Galleria will go into '17 as well. Now not to be ignored we continue to be active on new development. We opened two new outlets during the quarter in Tucson and Tampa both off to very strong sales start. Construction continues on two new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg both scheduled to open later this year, as well as a designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also started construction in upscale outlet center in Seoul, Southwest Seoul, Korea, scheduled to open in the spring of 2017, this will be fourth there. And we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge developed a premium outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport which will be our fourth outlet in Canada. This is expected to open in the fall of 2017. Two new full price developments are ongoing as you know one in Miami, a Brickell Centre opening this fall, and Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork scheduled to open in early 2017. Leasing demand at both are great. Brickell will be anchored by Saks; Clearfork will be open air and anchored by Neiman Marcus. Portfolio changes. We sold The Shops at Sunset Place and we recently completed the sale of Columbia George outlet. And we also recently acquired with our partner McArthurGlen the majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well-positioned within the market and has significant value added expansion opportunities. Let me run through the balance sheet, two senior offerings and totaling $1.9 billion was done last year with an average weighted coupon of 2.34%, term of 7.5. We redeemed four series of senior notes totaling 1.7 with an weighted average coupon of 6. We closed 23 new mortgages with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5 years. Our liquidity was $5.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5%, or I'm sorry 4.5 times, and recently we completed a very successful senior notes offering earlier this month raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and term of 2.9% at 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario. Dividends. We paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved a compound annual growth rate of more than 18% over the last five years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60 which is an increase of 14% year-over-year. Okay, that's pretty busy. Now, let me talk about our guidance, for '16, it's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared to the FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and again will be industry leading. Our range is based on the following assumptions : comp NOI for our portfolio malls, outlets, and mills, of at least 3.5%; and total NOI growth of more than 6% for the portfolio; no additional planned acquisition or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed; continued unfavorable impacts related to foreign currency devaluations which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015; and importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so an average diluted share count of $362 million. We are now looking forward to your questions. Operator, are you with us? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. David Simon : Hello, operator? Operator : Yes. Can you hear me? David Simon : We don't have any question ma'am. Let's go to the next. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum, UBS. Please proceed. Ross Nussbaum : David, you touched on the link between retailers having stores at your Malls and Internet sales in that local market. One of the questions I get recently from investors is the concept of occupancy cost being measured as a percentage of sales just at that Mall store. When you're talking to retailers now about the rent they should be paying, how is the conversation going such that you can capture some of those Internet sales in the rents that you're charging them at the physical Mall? Because to me that seems like an important shift in the business going on. David Simon : Well I don't -- again I -- let's separate media narrative to reality. But we're including anything, any sale that comes from their store and it could be driven by the Internet is in our sales that come from that store. So we're getting the benefit of that. And so I still think occupancy cost is still going to be very important to the overall negotiation of what the rent they're able to proceed. However, it is important to note that stores for these retailers are part of their distribution network. And when they look at whether or not they're going to keep a store open, they're also going to affect evaluate what their decrease in overall Internet sales might be in that market and that is a benefit to us -- not that we have a lot of stores that are risk for closures other than through bankruptcy. So at a 12.3% given our productivity and given where our rents are and what you've seen from the history, I mean we've got, we still have a very good run rate to continue increase our rents. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. And then a second question. Can you touch on your interest in Macy's real estate now that they are clear that they want to do something there? In particular, I guess in theory, it would be with your Hudson's Bay joint venture. But may be just touch on your interest level there. Thanks. David Simon : Well look they've been a very important partner of ours and obviously they have very good real estate. So I can say nothing really is happening that's material or meaningful other than our normal ongoing business and that's been very productive and we have a excellent relationship with Macy's both from a real estate and a corporate point of view. They've been very supportive in our efforts to enhance the quality of our real estate through our expansion and redevelopment activity and if they've got ideas on how they want to look at the real estate, we're happy to do it either as part of the HPC JV or on our own. But nothing really is happening other than day-to-day business. Rick Sokolov : And the only thing I would add in the course of that day-to-day business we acquired a Bloomingdale's store at Stanford demolished it creating small shop, they build a new Bloomingdale's store. We combined three Macy's stores into two at Del Amo to facilitate our expansion. So that day-to-day business does involve activities with respective of their existing stores. Ross Nussbaum : Thanks guys. David Simon : And, look, I think it's very interesting that the market needs to understand on these retailers Macy's and the Penney and down the list. I mean does that vast, vast, vast majority of their stores have four-wall profits. And Rick and I just did a tour in Texas this week and I'll let you guys figure out who the retailers are, a major note in Texas are, and we hear that repeatedly. So, Macy's, I'm sure that vast, vast, vast, vast majority of those stores that they have four-wall profits. So I don't anticipate there to be significant changes but we will see and I think it will give us the opportunity. I think Rick made a great point in that. We can pickoff a Bloomingdale's at the Stanford in the middle of the Mall and release it to high-end shops and they can build a new store that's a win-win for everybody involved. So I think there will be a few of those as well. Ross Nussbaum : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy, Citi. Please proceed. Michael Bilerman : Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. Just a question about the balance sheet and as you think about your very conservative balance sheet with exceptional cost of capital and access to capital. And I'm curious as you think about maintaining that really strong balance sheet, how much of it is thinking about opportunities down the road -- and I don't know how quickly those opportunities will come into view -- and how much of it is that your concern perhaps about the macro environment? And I recognize that use of capital you can buy back stock, which you haven't really done in the back half of the year, and you have a very large development and redevelopment pipeline which is funded by free cash flow. But your overall leverage metrics and access to capital are -- never been better in the Company's history. And I'm just trying to think about what's driving that in your mind as you run the Company? David Simon : Well I think it's a great point and it's ignored a lot in terms of how people look at our company. But I love the fact that our interest coverage is 4.5 times given the size of our, I should say fixed charge coverage, not just interest coverage. And I love the fact that we can fund our development and new development from our free cash flow, and yet at the same time have a compound annual growth rate, dividend increase of 18%. I mean you can't put those kind of metrics against anybody and they can't issue in a day paper at under 3% when the CMBS market is cracking and the life company market is cracking and the high yield market is cracking, and yet we're able to go whether it's in the Euro market or the U.S. fixed income market but to place that kind of paper in that kind of speed and it's undervalued by the equity markets. So me that is sacrosanct. And I have been very reluctant enter the big deal business, I continue to be. And where we are so busy, I mean, I -- as you know, I have a hard time speaking generally and I -- when they get -- when we write our script, I can barely get the words out because I didn't take elocution classes in high school. But the fact of the matter is we are extremely busy building and adding value to the portfolio using our external free cash flow that remains the focus. I think we'll be very conservative on buying our stock back in today's market and my view on the big deal business really hasn't changed. Christy McElroy : Hi David, it's Christy here. Just following up on some of the stats that you mentioned earlier, with traffic in the malls flat, but sales up 5.7% which is encouraging. I'm wondering if you have a sense for what's driving that differential, are people staying in the Mall longer, visiting fewer stores, are conversions higher, just several retailers out there commenting that Mall traffic is down and the impact that that perception is any share prices, just any information that we can get from your data, would be helpful. David Simon : Yes, I think it's a very important point to make the following distinction. So remember we get the overall traffic number and yet most of the folks that quote -- most of the folks that quote numbers are based on algorithms, so it's not real necessarily data like we have, and number two, is it is derived from certain stores. So it doesn't, it necessarily equate the mall traffic and it gives you store data but not mall traffic data and that's the distinction that I really important to make. And I will tell you the trend though with mobile technology is that the consumer today clearly is going to the physical environment more educated, they're doing less browsing and they're going to less stores. So we think that the store data that you get is in fact maybe it's a little bit not that far off but it doesn\u2019t represent mall traffic and I just think the consumers go and do a few less stores because they\u2019re doing less browsing because they\u2019re more informed prior to their visits. But overall the mall traffic is what we say it is, our comp sales are what they are, and its so operator driven, you could be in a category where one retailer is selling and another one is not and it's not tied with all boats but it's really retail and operator driven. And the good news is overall given the size of our portfolio, we have a pretty good handle on this -- overall we're having pretty good comp sales increases. Christy McElroy : So the bottom-line is the same number of people are coming to the mall, but sales are up 5.7% there are just spending more while they are there? David Simon : That's the bottom-line and they may be going to few less stores. I think, yes, you're probably right, I probably could have shortened the explanation but that's the bottom-line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt, Bank of America. Please proceed. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. It's Craig Schmidt. David Simon : I hope that's Craig. I hope that's Craig. Craig Schmidt : Yes it is Craig. David Simon : Right. Craig Schmidt : No transformation. My question is really on the future role of anchors at regional malls. How is your view changing of the anchors? I mean, there seems to be a lot of repurposing going on, such as the JVs and Seritage. And I'm also thinking about what you've done at Florida Mall and what you're going to be doing at Shops at Riverside : it seems like you're taking a somewhat different view of what the anchor's role is. David Simon : Well, look I think it's such as and I'll let Rick weigh in here. I mean it's such as real estate specific equation but in a lot of cases you know the vendors that go into a department store in certain cases would rather have mall stores. And when we feel as that's the case while we'd rather just have the mall, we just rather have the vendor as a retailer and we don't necessarily want to rely on the department store to bring those vendors. So again it's specific and it's all about creating the right environment and experience and in some cases having this department store as part of that is vital, I take Del Amo with Nordstrom. They built a fantastic store it is so complementary to what we've done. We couldn't be prouder of that redevelopment and that Nordstrom store and the environment is helping us create. In other cases, the vendor, we had a Saks store at Riverside. They don't do well in New Jersey all at all. And we feel like those vendors that were in that store actually would have a better experience in our redone environment than they would in the Saks box. So it's and Florida Mall is a great example of just taking underperforming Saks that was not attracting the consumer, we went from, I think at $10 million Saks to $50 million of revenue generated after repurposing that that box, and that's what it's all about. Rick? Rick Sokolov : Yes, the only thing I would add is that every mall has its own story. So for frankly at Roosevelt Field the addition of Neiman Marcus is going to be a fundamental expansion of the market area that's traditional fashion anchor. At Florida Mall, we added the Crayola Experience that in that market is just doing great business and expands the trade area of that property. What we're all about is trying to put in the appropriate retailers to maximize the importance of our properties in the markets that they serve. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And how is some of the progress on your JVs with Seritage? David Simon : Pretty good I just had breakfast with Dan. I think, hopefully we\u2019ll get four or five started this year Rick, right? That's the plan. Rick Sokolov : Yes, we literally we've got performance, plans done. That frankly the most interesting timeline is working with Sears is to how their store is going to be reconfigured and that just takes some time. But we've identified the replacement tenants, we've identified the performance, and as David said we anticipate having developments underway in at least half the properties we have in our joint venture this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. Just on the topic of occupancy cost, it has been steadily increasing over the past few years, as you've done a good job of really being able to push the rents despite slower sales growth. But I was just wondering : Is this something we should be concerned about? To what extent are retailers pushing back, or are the higher occupancy costs just a part of doing business in a strong mall now? David Simon : Well look I mean at 12.3%, I would not worry at all. And I think we have to put into perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. I mean we are in a, I mean, if you look at our results this year and what we did above and beyond our expectations to pick up the extraordinary gain and losses that I mentioned. But if you just look at our numbers and the fact that we overcame relatively softer retail environment, a lot of things going into that move towards durable goods and increase in healthcare cost and taxes and general economic malaise, we overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here and then obviously the strong dollar. If you look at our outlet business I mean traffic was up across the portfolio yet sales were down there because the international tourist spent less, it's not -- it's pretty good execution with some of the headwinds that we've done. The 12.3% the way I look at it is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy that we continue to well outperform GDP growth, and, if it were up 15%, 16% maybe that's when we would raise the alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got rate insurance to continue grow their cash flow. And if you look at our comp NOI which is a real number, okay, which is a real number of at least 3.5% and what's the Goldman -- tell me what the Goldman -- today's Goldman get the conservative economist to Goldman. Not the bullish one get the one that you've got in the closet. What's their GDP growth? What are they saying, 2%, 1.5%? Caitlin Burrows : Okay. David Simon : Well tell me what do they say, Caitlin. I want to say 1.5%; I mean we're 2.5% -- Caitlin Burrows : Sure. David Simon : We're 200 basis points above that and part of that is because we do have leases that are under market and we will be able to continue to push that. At the same time our business is all about repeat business. We've got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can meeting the expectations of our growth for us, for investors at the same time we want our retailers as strong as possible it's a very -- it's challenging to find that equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it and I\u2019m confident we can continue to do it not completely, sometimes we screw up, on -- it's all the various ends there. But at the end of the day we try to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors that's why I've been able to -- we've been able to grow our earnings 14% per annum, increase the dividend 18% per annum over a long period of time industry leading. We try to find that equilibrium we have an insurance policy. Caitlin Burrows : Got it, okay. So it sounds like we shouldn't be concerned yet there. And then just -- David Simon : I will let you know okay. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then just regarding your current share price, the market appears to be supporting other mall REITs that might have some take-out potential while perhaps punishing you as a potential buyer. So the stock's down today. Can you comment on basically turning this argument over and by buying yourself and repurchasing shares -- I know you mentioned before that you'd be very conservative with doing that in the future? David Simon : Well, look, I think what Bilerman said earlier, asked earlier, I mean we are out of the big deal business. So people can speculate all they want. And I do think the market should understand and as our plan that we will be conservative on buybacks. As some of the higher -- I understand Tom that some of the higher estimates out there on first call were due to the buyback number. So that's part of the issue there. We're going to be conservative there. I love having a great balance sheet. This is not a short-term game here. This is long-term. But I'm out of the big deal business, somebody wants to call me up and talk to me and show me how to make money, I'm all happy to have that conversation. But my opinion hasn't changed since really last Spring. So I don't really know what else I can tell you on that front. And we won't be afraid to buy back stock, it's just we're not planning right now. We have the authorization to do it. People are betting against that for whatever reason that's the markets but we have a growing dividend and growing earnings and that's usually a bad thing to bet against. Caitlin Burrows : I agree. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning, David. David Simon : How are you doing, Alex? Alexander Goldfarb : Doing well, doing well. So just quickly, I'll go to the second question first and then I'll go to my first question second, because you mentioned dividends. Last year you guys to raised the dividend quarterly. Obviously it was up almost 20% for the year. This year should the expectation -- you didn't raise it from fourth quarter. So should we think about just more normalized sort of annual increase? Or do you think that we'll see a steady state of increases throughout the year? And part of that is just trying to read into cash flow use. May be with what's going on you guys are trying to husband more cash; or maybe it was just how you raised it a lot last year and now you want to go back to an annual increase. David Simon : Yes, I think what we were, we've always -- we've been chasing our taxable income, as you know, and there is a lot that goes into that equation. If we kept it at $1.60 that would be 6% growth year-over-year, I would think that that would be at the bare minimum of what happens but I would start to like to get into a normalized once a year raise. So we don't do it sequentially, sequentially like we've been doing at quarter after quarter and I think that should be your expectation going forward. And we'll probably assess that at near the end of each year now as we had in the past. But that's subject to change obviously with the input of our taxable income calculation as well as obviously our boards input, but at the very, very least 6% growth, over 6% growth. I would like for it to be annualized and -- I'm sorry once a year when we evaluate it, which would probably most likely be in the back half, so we can position it for the proceeding or the subsequent year. But as you know with our NOI growth of least over 6-plus-percent, our taxable income is going to be increasing. And so that will be driving our dividend increase up as well. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, on -- I think it was in your response to Christy's question, if shoppers are getting more selective and visiting fewer stores : one, it sounds like a merchandising issue from retailers; and then, two, does that mean that we should expect higher retailer turnover? Like we should see more stores closing if they can't get their merchandising right? Or your view was the retailers that had trouble attracting shoppers last year are quickly addressing their merchandising issues? David Simon : Well, look, I think the retailers clearly are in that boat, and they're not as, what there is, we did experience in '15 a number of bankruptcies of kind of the really poor performing retailers. There was clearly a slowdown in retail sales in the back half of the year. And then when you couple that with the tourism issue, you couple that with the normal weather, I mean it was so to speak a perfect storm, and it took a lot of retailers out. I mean we've seen this movie and I don't know if it's Rocky 7 -- I'm ready for Creed. Okay. So we don't have to keep seeing this movie over again. I think our retailers are pretty sophisticated adapting very aggressive. And I think part of the responsibility of driving traffic for more stores is -- the onus is on us. I mean, we've got a great environment which does and is able to communicate to the consumer what's going on in the mall so that they can visit kind of more stores than they have and that they at least did in '15 and take advantage of them when they're in our store. And I think clearly as our retailers sneak up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fill out of the stores, return out of the stores, I mean all of that is going to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated that I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to visit more stores. So it's all the work-in-progress, we've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know we're doing a lot of that, we're at the forefront of lot of that activity to try and figure out how the best way to communicate to the consumer, so they go see eight or 10 stores as opposed to four, five, or six. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just for your -- I know how much you love your Crooked Stick suggestion box, but as you guys do a lot of the development and redevelopment, it would just be helpful from our end to have a table in the supp that just sort of quantifies the amount and quarter that developments and redevelopments will come online, just for a modeling perspective. David Simon : Yes, we're happy, well, I think I'm happy to do that, it doesn't -- now I will say this. I know there was a comment or two that said about our returns going down absolutely not, our mix changes every quarter which we probably, Tom, could do a better job of pointing that out. And I assure you that if we are doing to deliver; I mean we do have to have a materiality threshold for the size of our company. But I assure you and the market that if we have a major development or a major redevelopment where we're going to lay an egg, we'll let you know. That's not what happened in today's supplement. We had some things come off and we had some things come on, just like we do every quarter and Tom is happy to walk you through what went in and what went out. But I assure the market if we're going to lay an egg on anything that's new or whether it's new or redevelopment we'll let you know with some materiality threshold obviously. But that's not the case with the changes in our development pipeline and redevelopment pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore. Please proceed. Steve Sakwa : Just I guess two quick questions. You mentioned that, I guess, comp sales were up. I think you 5.7%. When I look in the supplemental and just looked at total sales it's basically flat December to December. And I realize that comp sales are only a piece of the overall sales. But as you replace weaker tenants with new ones I would think there's an uplift. I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the strong comp sales. David Simon : Remember our comp you got to be in place for 24 months. So that's not the case, that's number one. And number two, I mean we did have our -- that the -- we did have slippage in our tourist oriented centers not just the outlets but in a number of the malls that were I mean that we had to deal with. And again it wasn't a traffic issue and it's not anything other than and I know we've seen it from the retailers, but the tourism that is important to the economic growth of the United States of America may have come if they spent less and we have unbelievable great properties that in the long run are fantastic. And the sales have come out. I mean we have small shops and medium size shops that do $30 million, $40 million of volumes in some of these places. But the tourism affected that. And as you know we've got a lot going on in some of our major properties moving tenants in and out. So we put it all together and total sales were relatively flat. We don't view that as a big deal. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Any sense as to what -- of the overall sales, comp sales make up what percentage of that total sales number? Is that two-thirds of the bucket, three-quarters, a half? David Simon : 70%. Steve Sakwa : 70%? Okay. And then I guess as it comes to -- or in terms of bankruptcies this year, I realize you guys got hit pretty hard last year. You're working through. What is your expectation for bankruptcies this year? And how is that impacting that sort of 3.5% NOI number that you're giving us? David Simon : Well, look at, it is. I mean, we still have lease-up from last year, and we're -- we've budgeted in some of the weaker tenants whether they go bankrupt or we do, we renegotiate short-term deals while we replace them with strong tenants I mean that\u2019s all factored in there. So we have been conservative on overage rent. I mean these -- we're not a perfect science model I mean, nor is the U.S. economy. So we do the best that we can, budgeting the best that we can, being as conservative as we can. We clearly thought in '15, we would hit 4%; we didn't because of the overage rent thing that we did mention. And that was, as you know, overage rent you hit breakpoints or if you're over the breakpoints there is a lot of volatility the fourth quarter is important in total sales. And I mean that's hard to necessarily model. But we took a very conservative approach in how we look to the books at year-end. And we're taking a reasonably conservative approach; we still have work to do. But conservative sales, conservative lease-up, conservative restructuring at certain tenants whether in or out of bankruptcy is all factored into that number. But importantly Steve and this is the true distinction. I mean our number is -- our 3.5% is different than most people, okay. So you have to put that into perspective. Steve Sakwa : No, I do. I appreciate that. I'm just trying to get a sense. Do you think the 1.3 million will go up or down in '16? Is that -- do you think you have similar amounts? David Simon : I think it will go down, I think it will go down, '15 was a big year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan, Canaccord. Please proceed. Paul Morgan : Just in terms of the impact you mentioned, if I understand correctly, in terms of occupancy from the space that was added but wasn't -- and is leased but wasn't occupied at year-end. Was that, I mean was that sort of part of the budget that may be we just didn't fully understand going into the quarter? Or was there any openings that may be kind of slipped into the first quarter that were expected for the fourth quarter? David Simon : I think when you open a new project and you get the 90%, what was it 90.7% or whatever it was? I mean when you open a new project and you're at 90.7%, year one that's pretty good it\u2019s not just as 96% or 97% and that creates a little bit drag on the overall occupancy. So that's just real estate development. I mean I don\u2019t know of any project that opens a 100% occupied I mean may be a few do. And as I think we mentioned in the third quarter, we did put a lot in the system last year. So our resources were maxed out between all the redevelopments and all the new stuff, I again it's not like we're delivering these things at 60% occupied or 50%. I mean 90% after, 90.7% after at the end of year one is pretty good. So I think that's pretty good execution. Paul Morgan : Yes, okay. And then you've got a lot of your kind of A+ assets that are under construction right now with expansions and redevelopments. I mean is there any dislocation that takes place either in the numbers or just in terms of traffic? I mean if some of the malls are kind of getting torn up in pretty major ways as you're doing the expansions. I mean does that trickle through to sales in your expectation or CAM or anything that's material? David Simon : Well, I -- look, I mean I -- we don't want excuses, but, yes, I mean we ripped up Roosevelt Field, we ripped up King of Prussia, and we -- those were in -- we didn't take them out of our sales numbers and those things. You move tenants around. We had a number of that -- of those scenarios this year, which is investing in the future and it's not an immediate return. So I would tell you that all of those we had a setback in Copley, because we're ripping Copley to shreds, moving tenants around, making room for the potential of the apartments/condo tower. So that's clearly affecting us. But at the end of the day I mean that's just -- we're just not going to -- we're not going to use that as a basis to say, here is a little bit of a slippage, but yes it clearly is affecting -- it clearly affected '15 both from a NOI point of view and a sales point of view. And -- because a lot of these were moving traffic around, were closing entrances, and there is absolutely dislocation going on. Paul Morgan : Thanks. Then just lastly, I mean any update on your kind of current thoughts about mixed-use? You've got obviously some of it in your redevelopment pipeline. But is it -- as you think about your shadow pipeline, both with your own properties and then specifically with some of the Seritage opportunities, I mean, how big a piece of your portfolio is residential or other mixed-use? Sort of something we could see over the next decade? David Simon : I still think it's going to grow, but selectively. I mean, I kind of view this as the good news in that it's almost like our international investments. We've had such great results from our international investments. I mean, if you looked at what's on our books and what the value of this real estate is it's a homerun, a homerun. If you look at the yield on cash flow returns, a homerun. That gives us -- the only wrinkle on that is we lost $10 million in China. But if you look at Kle'pierre, McArthurGlen our own development in Japan, Korea, Canada, homerun. We've also had great experience. And I can't think of a problem we've had, Rick, in your mixed used development. So I -- as we gain more confidence in that business I think we'll continue to do it. But as you know that's so driven by supply and demand and it's so specific to the real estate. But we like it, we have had good success in it, we'll continue with it assuming we can continue to produce the results that we produced in that area. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. Paul Adornato : Hi, good morning. Was wondering if you could compare the performance of your top-tier properties, minus the noise of any redevelopments, versus the bottom tier. The market seems to dislike Class B properties. I was wondering if your lower tier is subject to some of those same risks. David Simon : Well, look, I think our portfolio is the -- our results and our averages kind of the indicate -- indicative of kind of what results were. So I don't think there is any unusual trend. I think market sometimes may be overreacts to the only game in town mall. We think that business is good and very viable. If that's the only game in town market, have too much retail, it's going to be heard, but that could be in an A market too. I don't think we had any real unpleasant surprises and the not exciting markets that we still own. The only thing that was a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tour of spend that we've mentioned. And obviously that happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean, we can't hide from that fact, not a long-term issue I hope. And -- but the tourist reined in a little bit, they rein in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in Miami, North and South of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. We have Mexican Nationals to shop at our -- some of our premier properties. We've got the Canadian snowbirds I mean, that's -- that happens. That's the only trend that I would say is a little bit different than what we've experienced, not the only game in town which is -- we are in some of those markets but they continue to perform very well. Paul Adornato : Thanks. And as a follow-up, could you talk about rent growth at the luxury side of the retail business? Which we expect, given the dollar. David Simon : I think it's good, because as you know a lot of that even with the growth, even with that the tourism spending down most of those leases are well below market and -- number one. And number two is, they are still unique enough properties that when the opportunity presents itself that the demand is still there for that real estate. So very few people -- I'd say very few retailers don't -- that are of that nature that we want in those properties don't look at the long-term opportunity. But if it -- if there is a difference it's on the margin. But we still -- we're still pretty insulated from that, demand is good and our leases are under market there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim, SunTrust. Please proceed. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. So, David, hypothetical question. Given that we know a little bit more about the market and what the equity markets are doing versus last spring, all else equal -- and I know Macerich has sold some assets -- but in your mindset today and what you know about the world, would you still be a buyer of Macerich, all else equal, if it was back in the market today? David Simon : I'm not going to comment on that. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. David Simon : All I can -- all I'm going to comment on is where we are today. And I've explained that a couple different places, okay. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Okay, and then the second question on your Outlet business, you've already talked about the traffic or tourists being down a little bit. But does that eventually translate into lease spreads? Where it's not just the overage rents that are taking a little bit of a hit, but if this continues are your lease spreads that the tenants are willing to pay eventually become more at risk? David Simon : Well, the reality is I wish they were at market, because then the volatility -- so just say, when we roll over a lease we try to get effective rent, which is base rent plus overage rent and the reason we have a little more volatility is because the lease hasn't expired. So the good news is as these leases expire we're going to be able to get them at market rent. I mean that's why we had a little exposure in the fourth quarter, because we're not at market rent, we're not at market rent. So even with today's decrease in tours and spend, the important point though also is that the traffic was up and so that's an important point. I mean the traffic was up, it was really just the spend was down. And I think that's just going to be an adjustment until we get where the currencies are a little more stable and anniversary these sales. But the -- it's our intention to make that overage volatility go away and that's marking the leases to market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Vincent Chao : Yes, good morning or good afternoon. Just curious, going back to the 1.3 million square feet of bankruptcy space that was taken back, I thought I heard earlier that 70% had been re-let as of the end of the year. And apologize if I'd missed this, but I guess how did that stack up relative to your expectations? I mean, would you have expected to have more of that re-leased by now? And just I'll leave it at that. Rick Sokolov : Hi. This is Rick. In fact, we were doing very well with that releasing. What we are going to do is we are not going to put our space on sale, we are holding margins. In fact, the rents for foot of the space that has to lease are above the rents of the tenants that left because of bankruptcy and we're making sure that we are getting in the right tenants at the right price, at the right space. So we're on track with that, and there you'll continue to see the benefit of that coming into this year as more of those leases open. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks. And on a slightly different topic, just going back to the -- sort of the changing profile of the mall and may be the decreasing importance of the anchors, particularly as a traffic driver, just curious if this -- or if you think about shortening lease terms from the traditional leased deals, five years or so, just so you have more control over how to control and create that experience, given that tastes change pretty quickly and things like that. Rick Sokolov : When we do our leasing every space and every tenant has their own situation and we are strategic about our terms. If we feel that it's a tenant that is underperforming the mall, may be we'll do a shorter-term, if it's a tenant that were higher desires of having in the mall, we want them to remodel, we may give them a longer-term. So there is no overarching strategy on term, it's really a lease specific strategic decision. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund, Jefferies. Please proceed. George Hoglund : I was wondering if you could give some additional color on the trends in asking rents. Because what we've been hearing is that asking rents are down year-over-year in the A malls as it's getting a little bit tougher to back-fill space, and the balance of power may be shifting a little bit towards the tenants. Just wondering if you could just give some color on that. David Simon : May I ask where do you hear that? George Hoglund : Hearing it from brokers out there. David Simon : And what cities are these brokers from? Are they talking about like city street space? Or they -- I mean is it mall space? George Hoglund : It's mall space. David Simon : Well, I think you could -- I would put more faith in what we would tell you and the answer is that we don't see that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Muller, JP Morgan. Please proceed. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. Just a couple quick ones here. I guess first, where do you see occupancy ending at year-end '16? David Simon : We are projecting an increase from where we are this year. Mike Mueller : Okay. Any shot at narrowing that down a little bit? David Simon : No, no, because look the end of the day -- we're -- listen, we made our FFO this year, was $3.6 billion, right? Andy Juster : Yes. David Simon : So we -- which happen to be more than certain technology companies, I won't name names, okay. And -- I mean I know everybody wants all these metrics, but you've got to look at what we're all about, which is growing earnings, growing dividends, investing for the future. And I do think there is this move on metrics that I just want to put it in overall perspective, that it's not how we -- we don't stress over metrics the way others might. We're just focused on increasing our cash flow, investing for the future, making our properties the best they can be in a particular market for the benefit of shareholders, communities, retailers. And we will just tell you that we -- as we model all this we are expecting an increase in occupancy, it takes a lot of work. How many leases did we sign this year my friend? Rick Sokolov : Over 10 million square feet. David Simon : 10 million square feet, right? So you know it's hard to model. But we've had a pretty good track record. But certain things were out of our control bankruptcies, tourism spend and so on. So again, it's a slight uptick and we hope to be able to achieve that. Mike Muller : Okay. And then may be a quick Andy question. It looks like interest income tripled in the fourth quarter relative to the third, just wondering what's driving that? Andy Juster : Now -- Mike Muller : I know it's not a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but still. Andy Juster : Yes. We can get back to you on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum, Boenning. Please proceed. Floris van Dijkum : David, Floris. Quick question on your NOI growth. You posted 7% this year. If you do that for 10 years you've basically almost doubled your NOI. Is it reasonable to expect that kind of growth going forward, sort of the 3% on top of your same-store numbers that you're expecting to post? David Simon : Well, it's a good question. I can't -- 10 years is a hard time for me to project. But look, I think the redevelopment and development pipeline that we've got I mean I think we've got a pretty decent shot of continuing that as we go forward. I mean, I think fact is of course, as you know a lot of people who have doubted our ability to grow our earnings because of the size of the company and obviously math does make it a little bit harder, but the fact is nobody in our industry -- and when I say industry, I -- I'm talking about retail real estate, nobody in our subsector of our industry, retail real estate has been able to do that over a, sure a quarter here or quarter there, a year there, or year there. But over the life of our company nobody has been able to do this. I mean we started out with I think, if I can remember the math $200 million of earnings, we're at $3.6 billion, okay. That's not too shabby. As I said in my annual report quoting Adam Sandler, but nobody liked but I kind of thought it was funny. But point is I don't know, I -- but we got a good runway for the next few years, Floris. Floris van Dijkum : One follow-up question may be, David, on Aventura. I noticed there it's not in your supplements, but there are potential plans for, I guess an expansion that Seritage is suing Turnberry over. Can you make any comments on that? David Simon : No, we're not named in that lawsuit, so we have no -- and we haven't seen the complaints, so we've got nothing more to add. And the one question on the other income was the cash flow that we got from our investment in Value Retail, which tends to happen year-after-year, but it -- we -- since we only -- we cost account for it. For those of you old like me, you know what that means? We don't equity account for it. So we only book the income upon receipt of cash and it happened to be in that quarter, but it tends to happen year-after-year. Operator? Operator : I would now like to turn the conference over to David Simon. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. Very, very good questions. Appreciate staying with us and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Okay. We had strong start to 2016 we completed several significant redevelopment projects started constructions on others, announced more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We completed the acquisition of the shops to crystal, extending our presence in Las Vegas marketplace and we continue to achieve strong operating financial results which were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which is an increase of 15.4% compared to prior year. Our -- we had strong key operating metrics. Mall and Premium outlet occupancy was 95.6%. Leasing activity remains healthy which we the Mall and Outlet business had re-leasing spreads of $10.24 per square foot, which is an increase of 17.5%. And our base minimum rent was $49.70 up more than 4% compared to last year. Total sales per square foot for our Mall and Outlet business was 6.13 compared to 6.21 in the prior year period. We measure our success through growth of operating income and cash flow. We have a unique ability to drive growth through not only increases in comparable property NOI, but also through disciplined capital allocation for new development, redevelopment acquisitions and investments and our press release and supplement this quarter we have provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. These new metrics provide further detail in the profitability generated by our portfolio and we have broken them out into four categories, comparable property NOI, NOI from new development, redevelopment, expansions and acquisitions that are not included in comp NOI, NOI from our international properties which is our premium outlets and designer outlets. And then our share of NOI from investments which includes Kl\u00e9pierre and HBS Global Properties and then below the property NOI line you have the corporate sources of NOI. And importantly, for the first quarter of 2016 our total portfolio NOI increased 7.8% out of which comp NOI increase was 5.1%. We see the supplement at the end of the first quarter redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing into 33 properties across all three of our platforms our share approximately 2 billion. We finished the two year transformation of Roosevelt Field, including comprehensive enhancement thought-out the malls, the addition of two level fashion specialty store expansion with being anchored by Long Islands first Neiman Marcus store. We also are nearing completion with Stanford Center, including the new Bloomingdale's as well as reclaiming that space for specialty stores. Transformations like these are examples of what\u2019s adding to our overall profitability. We started constriction on several new projects including the important expansion at the Outlets at Orange and construction continuous on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties and some of the best properties in the country. The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, King of Prussia were very common, The Galleria in Houston, most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months. Construction continues on two new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg, both are scheduled to open later this year as well as our designer outlet in Provence, France which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also started construction during the quarter with our partner, Ivanhoe Cambridge on our fourth outlet in Canada in Edmonton, Alberta, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2017. Construction continues on to new full new price developments, one in Miami at Brickell City Centre and the other in Fort Worth at The Shops of Clearfork, which is scheduled to open 2017. Brickell will open in the fall of this year. We also completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystal. Purchase price was $1.1 billion. We plan to place a $550 million mortgage on the property in the next two months, and we are a 50/50 partner with Invesco, and we look forward to building upon high quality asset with its successful foundation. We acquired a majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany, with our partner, McArthurGlen. And during the first quarter, we sold interest in two residential properties and one non-core retail property. As you know, gains and losses on our non-retail assets, including investments, are included in our FFO per share, which we believe is consistent with the white paper. This resulted in a quarter-over-quarter benefit of approximately $0.06. Capital markets, we completed a notes offering of $1.35 billion, weighted average interest rate of 2.97% and 8.2 years of duration. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion. We announced our dividend at $1.60, which is a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. We increased our guidance to $10.72 to $10.82 reflecting very good performance. And we are very pleased frankly with our overall performance given an overall lacklustre U.S. economy and we welcome your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions].Our first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citibank. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, David, it's Michael Bilerman for Christy. I just wanted to go first and then Christy will have one. And I was wondering, how the markets you think about Simon strategically going forward? And it\u2019s about two years to the day when you spun off WPG, all the assets under 10 million of NOI and arguably lower sales productivity and now you are left with this immensely high quality model portfolio, a global outlet portfolio, the mills portfolio and its taking -- here and some other sort of ventures around. Should we think about potential spins of any of those businesses going forward or do you think you are still going to own assets across the price spectrum of retail real estate? David Simon : Yes. We have no -- we have no intention to spin off any other assets. We think they are absolutely synergistic across with our retailer relationships. We have the lowest overhead, lowest cost of capital, given the portfolio. We have got historically the best comp NOI growth. So, as long as we can continue to do what we are doing, I don\u2019t see any reason why we would want to spin anything off. And they all fit nicely together. They are all in major metro markets. All the assets are producing great cash flow. And we are -- I mean our results speak for themselves. I think the WP spin-off was really a focus on we were -- we were a little -- we weren\u2019t focusing as much on the smaller properties as probably we should have and we thought that was in the best interest of the shareholders, but we don\u2019t see any other reason to take any other corporate restructuring beyond that. Christy McElroy : Hi good morning, it\u2019s Christy here. Just wondering if -- and tax fund stops paying you rent at anytime during the first quarter and if reserving for that might have impacted your bad debt at all in Q1? And maybe you could give us an update on sort of your overall outlook for retailer bankruptcies and stock closing for the balance of the year and whether or not you are more or less cautious versus the quarter ago? David Simon : Well I -- look I think a quarter ago we were cautious, we continue to be cautious. I don\u2019t want to mention specific retailers whether they paid rent or not paid rent. The only one that\u2019s filed bankruptcy thus far is Paxton [ph]. I am sure there were some pre-petition amounts that we wrote-off in the quarter. I mean it\u2019s not overly material and that\u2019s part of what we have dealt with for 60 years retail bankruptcies. So we remain cautious, our biggest reason we were cautious, is that the U.S. economy continues to flatten out, I mean there is not a lot of growth I suggest you look at a lot of industries in our beyond real estate to see what\u2019s going on in the U.S. economy and it is what it is. Christy McElroy : Thank you. David Simon : You know but we have been cautious on those couple of retailers but you know we will deal with it. Christy McElroy : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Your line is open Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I notice other income and consolidated properties were up significantly, was that related to one specific area? David Simon : Well I would suggest you look to page 21 on our supplemental. Our corporate, this is after our property portfolio NOI corporate and other sources were up roughly $20 million and that was a function of the residential interest that we had that through that flowed through our corporate NOI number. Craig Schmidt : Okay and you have been doing a great job touching on some really big redevelopments. I just wonder actually you start to touch more and more of your top properties, will the shadow of pipeline start to consider and include maybe a second tranche of redevelopments to continue that path of growth. David Simon : Well I mean, if you look at our 8-K, you can see all the stuff that we have been working on. I just spend an hour and a half with my guy that does residential, which other way just has made 20 million bucks which ain\u2019t bad. We sold those at a lower cap rate than what we bought crystals [ph] which I thought was a pretty good interesting dynamic in our industry. He\u2019s got; the other meaning was longer that I wanted it to be because my attention span is decreasing. But as I get older, but the fact is he\u2019s got plenty of things going on across the portfolio. If you look at our 8-K all the stuff they are doing, I think we touching a lot. We just opened Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods at Independence Mall. Just to give you one small example of kind of a solid middle market mall that produces a lot of cash flow year after year, but continue. We think continue to get better and I mean -- so the answer is we are touching everything. Craig Schmidt : And just bringing up crystals, is there an expansion opportunity I guess with the Harmon [ph] powers at that property? David Simon : Yes. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jeff Spector : Great, thank you. Just wanted to ask about the retail landscape I feel like all the years Craig and I have covering the sector this past year we\u2019ve seen some real dramatic changes. I guess how have things changed in your view just from a year ago and your planning whether with the lease contracts or your approach with retailers, you know what your latest thoughts? David Simon : Well honestly, I think maybe you are getting caught up in a lot of the media discussions. I mean our business is as solid as it\u2019s even been. We\u2019ve have top NOI increases, 5.1%. Our earnings grew 15.4% per year. We are projecting to have $10.72 to $10.82. So I think our simplistic view is it\u2019s not as bad people want to write about, and I think the biggest issue out there frankly is that we have a U.S. economy, and we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll never use excuses but I think you have to look at our performance in conjunction with what\u2019s going on in the U.S. economy. And the fact of the matter is the U.S. economy is flat line, and yet we are holding our old and gaining market share with a lot of our properties and obviously we\u2019ve got great tourist oriented centers that have had a tough year. I think that we after this first quarter we\u2019ll probably anniversary the stronger dollar here coming up, but we\u2019ve seen the tourism sales decreased unnecessarily the traffic. But the media about the death we don\u2019t see it, demand is fine. Properties are getting better, we got supply and demand in our favour, no one\u2019s building Class A Outlets or Malls to any degreeable issue, certainly there will be retail space that gets re-focussed which will help us obviously in supply and demand equations and I just -- I don\u2019t view it beyond that. The Internet is not the panacea. A lot of CapEx have been spent there. It\u2019s not showing the returns for retailers, so I think they are going to -- their biggest and best opportunity continues to be bricks and mortar and you know we\u2019ll keep plugging along. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. But that\u2019s how we view it from here. Jeff Spector : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, hi good morning, David. First thanks for page 21, the NOI breakout it\u2019s helpful. A quick question, maybe you commented on the resi upfront, but can you just give a little bit more color which projects they were and then as we go through the rest of the pipeline, I mean you know obviously you got the tower that you announced down in Houston but how much sort of embedded potential is there in the portfolio and is each project that you guys undertake something that you are going to harvest itself, so we should expect over the next several years more of these $20 million quarterly benefits? David Simon : Yes, I think we tend not be long term. We look at these things more as investments than we do operating properties, that\u2019s been our point of view just like in Q1, 2015 we had a gain from a development side, we decided the flip in Europe as opposed to staying involved. And so the good news is that we are able to create -- you know we\u2019ve had a few mistakes. So we are not perfect, but we are able to generate additional income in this company through all of our activity. And I mean that\u2019s been proven in Q2 of last year as you know we had a big sizeable gain in sale of marketable securities. So please remember that when we report Q2. So we are able to do that, and we do look at investments in whether its hotels, residential we do look at them as investments and we do tend to look at those as ones that we are not going to own for 30, 40, 50 years like we do the vast majority of our retail holdings. And that will flow through the P&L as rightly so. That\u2019s GAAP accounting by the way, which happy to explain to anybody that its good GAAP accounting. And I do think with the list of all the activity you are going to see that episodically, but certainly consistent with how we are going to drive our cash flow growth. Now, specifically we sold fire wheel residential and we also sold SouthPark which additionally which goes to show you how things can change. We actually did SouthPark as the Condo development. The market crash we actually rode off our investment in that, and that went through FFO. And then now our investment in that was not big. So I think it was like 3, 4 million bucks of equity. But and then we just turned into a residential not a condo but just a multi-family projects and we just sold it. The two of them as I said you, I mean, we though the cap rates were very aggressive. Our partners wanted to sell. We view those like I said as investment. So we decided to sell them. The results flow through this quarter. And I do think we will have a pipeline of other investments that we don\u2019t consider core outside of retail always flow through our P&L and hopefully as I said we embedded a thousand, but hopefully there will be a lot more incoming game. Just like our Simon Venture group. We\u2019ve -- anything that is profitable will flow through FFO. Anything that\u2019s a loss will wash out and in fact we had don\u2019t get panicky, but we\u2019ve actually written off a couple of investments that have that just we don\u2019t see the value the other still maybe plugging along. But we took a conservative approach to go ahead and flush those through and those are through FFO. So that\u2019s how we do it. But I\u2019m hopeful that we will continue to create value and also it\u2019s a different way including building and selling residential. When we do properly [ph] and part of that project will be condos I mean, those will flow through the P&L. As you would expect those would happen and they would flow through FFO, because that\u2019s how we view the definition of the FFO white paper which is you know we adhere to stringently Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. You guys have been quite vocal on that point. On crystals, I mean you guys obviously have basically unlimited capital, so can you just talk about your decision to JV that especially if there\u2019s development upside and how especially in that market given how it book cases, the strip, your decision to JV and then other investments how you figure out if you want to do it wholly versus bringing in a partner? David Simon : Well in this case was relatively simple. We approached a partner and we like to approach those, and we fell it would be beneficial to do a joint venture. We the assets have a great foundation. It\u2019s been well leased, it does high sales productivity and it we are hopeful that we could add value to it overtime and we have a great partner to do that and may be some other things. So in this case, the opportunity really came from them and so it was natural to just partner in it. You know that doesn\u2019t mean each deal is a little bit separately, we may or may not partnered it depends on the circumstances but in this case they really approached us and we like to who approached us and it\u2019s a very good asset that\u2019s been well leased and managed and operated by the owners and their manager ahead of time and we hope that we will able to do add value to it overtime. And now look, I mean it\u2019s not cheap, but given where A quality assets are being priced in all sectors, I think it\u2019s going to be a good deal for us in the not too distant future. I think it\u2019s good to start and it will get better overtime. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Are you guys able to hear me okay, cause we are getting comments that you can\u2019t hear me. But it sounds like you can hear me fine. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. You are coming through clearly. David Simon : All right. Appreciate it. Alexander Goldfarb : Happy -- it. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. I was just wondering again on those non-retail gains that were included in the first quarter results, was that $0.06 gain that you referenced included in your prior guidance. David Simon : Yes. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then if you look ex that $0.06 impact, the growth is still over 10%, but it doesn't look like your full year guidance is quite that high? So I was just wondering is there anything else driving the first quarter to be especially strong or just trying to see to what extent you might be being conservative for the rest of year versus actually expecting a slowdown, albeit from a pretty high level. David Simon : Good question. First of all I believe our growth would have been 12%. Caitlin Burrows : Yes. David Simon : 12% if you wanted to, it\u2019s upto you and I understand why you would want to. You know just say okay the $0.06 is a success. But it\u2019s actually 12% and look, I think you know we are as we started, I think it\u2019s consistent with what we described when we get our year-end call, is that we are still being conservative and how we are looking at the business because primarily not because of the internet, not because of department stores, not because of I don\u2019t know. But there -- we do have exposure to tourism, that\u2019s obviously affecting our average rent you can see that when I was explained a day on the P&L. And the U.S. economy even though it feels like it should be growing is more or less flat lining. I mean, I don\u2019t what does Goldman think, the first quarter GDP is going to be this year. What is your guide\u2026 Caitlin Burrows : You asked me last quarter, so I looked it up. 1.8%. David Simon : All right, well I take the under -- so -- is that\u2019s not costing? Is it? Caitlin Burrows : I am not sure who exactly it is from. David Simon : Well, we know you have like 10 of them, so you will get a right no matter what. But, so we are just being, I\u2019d say we are being overly conservative and just because there are -- you know you\u2019ve got the election year; by the way I hear it\u2019s very interesting. I -- we have essentially no exposure to the U.K. But the U.K. is softening. It just -- there is a general softening worldwide in the worldwide economy and we as much as I would love to be immune to that, we can\u2019t be. We are not. We are consumer oriented company, and I mean we are the basically the worldwide economy is flattening. There is a lot of stuff out there. And we are just being a lit bit of cautious. And obviously I mean, we all know there is a few tenants out there that may or may not go bankrupt may or may not close the bunch of stores. We\u2019ve got to be -- we have got to be judicious on how we model their future. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then also just if you could -- I know you mentioned as we all know, tourist sales are not so great. If there is any comment you could make just on the malls versus outlets versus mills, either in numbers or just a general feeling? David Simon : I am happy to say that our comp sales were up nicely in the mall business and down in the outlet business. And down in the outlet business 100% due to high producing tourist centers and the fact that the consumer the traffic is not down. The traffic is up in the outlet business. But the fact of the matter is, their spend is less because of the stronger dollar in. We are going to anniversary that at some point this year, but we didn\u2019t anniversary yet in the first quarter. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open. Ross Nussbaum : Good morning I am here with Jeremy Metz. Hey David, I thought the fact that you guys put up nearly 4.5% base rent growth in the quarter was pretty impressive, despite the sluggish sales environment. But I guess at least it leads to the question of realistically how long can that continue. The occupancy cost is up year over year from 11.7% up to 12.5%. So I guess realistically, if in fact mall sales are at the similar levels for the next year, do you think we're going to be looking at occupancy costs for your portfolio that is pushing 13.5% a year from now? David Simon : Well again, we could argue ad nauseam [ph] and I\u2019ve lost the argument, so I will admit defeat, okay. I will admit defeat publicly. We have lost the argument on the correlation or lack thereof between retail sales and our ability to drive rents, which happens I believe that are more toward supply and demand and then retail sales, because as you know if retailer is not producing results and there are lease happens to come up, we have the ability certainly to replace them with a retailer that\u2019s going to be more productive. Now as I also said in the mall business, our comp sales are actually up. It\u2019s in the outlet business where we are seeing the reduction in comp sales and that is absolutely unequivocally tied to what\u2019s going along with the tourism picture. And as I said, hopefully that will anniversary and then that base will move. Now the comp NOI growth was outstanding in for the whole portfolio, but it was particularly good in the outlet business, so that it is a very profitable category for our retailers and we have the ability to drive rents and drive NOI. So, at this point we can argue ad nauseam [ph] about the correlation, I\u2019d rather not, we\u2019ll do the best we can and like I said, we are going to grow, we are going to grow our comp NOI better maybe one day or we will revert to the main and I am not guaranteeing that we won\u2019t, but we have grown couple of 100 basis points comp NOI above and beyond the GDP growth because of what that I think is our portfolio skews towards the better customer. And I am hopeful that that trend will continue, and I actually think it\u2019s more tied to what\u2019s going to go on in tourism and what\u2019s going to go on in the general economy that it is one particular retailer sales. And well that does not necessarily mean anything about the property. But I have lost the argument, I admit defeat, we\u2019ll do the best we can. Ross Nussbaum : All right. My follow-up question is on your guidance. If I focus in on the comment you made which was, I think $0.03 of the beat this quarter was not related to the asset sales, you only raised guidance for the full year by $0.02. So I guess the question is, if I annualized the non-asset sale beat during the quarter it\u2019s obviously a bigger number than what you raised guidance by. Are you being conservative, or was there anything else going on in the quarter that\u2019s not necessarily recurring? David Simon : There is absolutely nothing going on in there. I mean, the disclosure you see the comp NOI you see all of that. I -- we\u2019re you know Ross we continue to just be relatively conservative given what\u2019s going on to the general U.S. economy. And I\u2019m not again, I am not using that as excuse but there is a level of -- there is just level around the world about consumer spending growth in wages, election year we still have certain retailers that may or may not impact us maybe we\u2019ve got -- maybe we budgeted them right, maybe we didn\u2019t -- all of that none of that really is all that material for us, thankfully. We\u2019ve built this company to sustain ins and outs of certain retailers; all of this affects us on the margin. As you know, I mean whether you slice is by products type, by geography, by retailer, you cut slice bake Europe whatever. I just think generally, we are operating appropriately given the growth in the economy and again our year-over-year, if you didn\u2019t hear our delta and quarter-over-quarter Q1 '15, Q1 '16 was really $0.06 because of the opportunity that we sold in Q1 of '15 of last year. Okay, so if you are going to look at the delta, don\u2019t look at $0.08 really look at $0.06 if that\u2019s important to you. Ross Nussbaum : Appreciate it. Thanks Dave. David Simon : Yes, no worry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] from Mizuho. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A first one for you, David. I guess on the acquisition market. I'm curious on what you are hearing and seeing these days in your conversations with potential sellers. Are you getting approached a bit more? Are you getting a sense that more people are willing to engage in conversations than maybe a year or two ago, given some of the concerns about the broader macro that you laid out earlier? David Simon : You know that\u2019s interesting. I would have thought -- maybe but not really, not really. I mean as you know we are not actively scouring the world for new deals and as I have stated to you before the big deal business is not something on our drawing board at this time and you know there is a selective thing here there but it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not as if and maybe it\u2019s my personality, but it\u2019s not a -- I\u2019m not getting a lot of phone calls. Rick, are you getting any phone calls? Rick Sokolov : I\u2019m not, you know I am a better person now. David Simon : Rick certainly has the better personality but -- so the answer is not really, but you know our business is --it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. It is when we have a slow economy it really requires a lot of patience, lot of grinding, a lot of focus on the details. Sometimes that creates opportunity in itself. But at this point nothing really jumps out of me. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. And I appreciate that. And then, one more if I might ask, might be redundant but I\u2019m having a bit of trouble hearing you earlier. But, did I hear you say that you would be putting a $500 million mortgage on Crystal Shops? And if so just curious on thoughts for the use of capital. Is it effectively earmarked for maybe the redev, or how should we think about any excess proceeds from that? David Simon : Well, simplistically it was $1.1 billion deal. We\u2019re going to put 550 thereabouts mortgage on it, which will have positive leverage which we think it\u2019s very important, just using good old real estate 101 fundamentals. And the balance of the equity required will be split between us and our partner, Invesco. Simple as that, so there is no access financing proceeds. The financing is really part of the purchase price financing sources and uses. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then one last one, more of an accounting one. The other day, obviously there is the big block floated by you guys on behalf of the DeBartolo of 4.4 million shares. Just curious if Simon bought any of those shares, certainly again maybe not as an attractive a price a few months back, but just curious if the company at all participated in buying down any of those shares? David Simon : Well just to be technically accurate, we didn\u2019t float it, was part of the DeBartolo family estate and we did not -- Simon property group did not buy any stock. And as you know the shares were placed relatively quick and straight forward manner. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, got it. David Simon : We had nothing to do with the sale of those shares. That was all between DeBartolo and the DeBartolo family, the state holdings and their advisor. And they have been a great limited partner, very supportive, they are still a very, very significant owner and it -- those are the facts. Unidentified Analyst : Wonderful. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning guys. Actually first question is for Rick. I was curious as we are headed into ICS, if broadly speaking there was any themes maybe you're thinking about as we head out to Vegas? And maybe more specifically any projects that are more mission critical for your team? Rick Sokolov : Well it\u2019s interesting, because as David has said, our portfolio has never been stronger and we still have significant demand for our properties. And where we are totally focused is maximizing the rent and productivity of our properties and so our themes going after is making sure we get the right retailers in the right spaces in the right sizes so we can maximize our revenue. And we obviously are spending time doing that, but frankly for us ICSE is relevant but we have retailers coming in here all the time. We have a major retail in here coming in tonight and here for the next three days going over the whole portfolio. So we are going out there optimistically. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of good reversed enquiries as to our space, and we\u2019ve got a great portfolio across all of our platforms to try and market. Jeff Donnelly : And maybe just a follow up or two. I guess maybe David, somewhat related to that. How do you think about the pursuit of omnichannel ultimately plays out for retailers down the road? Because while bricks and mortar as you said, is the biggest and best channel today for retailers, consumers do like to buy online, irrespective of whether or not it is weighing on retailer margins. So I guess, I'm curious. I mean if you think forward a few years, do you think lower margins are just the new normal for omnichannel retailers and that's all she wrote, or do you think retailers ultimately have to effectively price in the convenience aspect of buying online, or take it to the extreme, do you think there is going to be a time when retailers need to restructure and that gives them an opportunity to sort of reset their cost basis and their online business and shed the weaker stores? David Simon : Well, again, I think the fallacy [ph] in what is talked about is the fact that even if the stores are don\u2019t have high -- high sales per square foot they could generate a lot of operating cash flow for them. So I don\u2019t look at the stores losing money they are going to close the stores that\u2019s for sure. The issue is if the store -- the sales metrics that we all expect us, but many let say -- let me restate it many focus on does not necessarily tied to profitability because a lot of these stores could very low rent, could be fully depreciated, could be you know when markets that aren\u2019t great, exciting markets that are growing but they produce a lot of operating cash flow. They need that operating cash flow to make investments and whatever they want to make investments, whether that\u2019s omnichannel or you know technology or new stores or whatever. So the statement they are less productive, therefore they are going to close stores is not how I think they look at it. I think they look at whether the store has a four wall profit. And whether or not if they close it, what does it really do for the organization. So, you know what is this all going to mean? I think at the end of the day the all retailers have to be profitable. All e-commerce player have to be profitable, unless you know Wall Street and other investors are going to fund those investments. And I don\u2019t have a crystal ball as to how it\u2019s all going to shake out. Could it put pressure on bricks and mortar, certainly it could but I think you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that a lot of these are cash cows that they are using, maybe they are not investing in them like the way they should or we as owners of the real estate would like to see him do it, but that I don\u2019t think that equates to store closures necessarily. Now if they become unprofitable, they are going to close the store, simple as that. You have to weigh that against what they charge the store in terms of corporate allocations and overhead and all that and all that. And I think certainly investments in technology is putting pressure on the retailer. And we have to be sensitive to that, but you know I think they are going to look at carefully what services they are going to need to provide to the consumer, because at the end of the day they chase that and they can\u2019t create profitability out of it, you know that\u2019s not doing anybody any good. Jeff Donnelly : Helpful. And just one last question. There has been a lot of ink spilled in the folks in our seeds estimating the implication of the spinout of REITs in the S&P under the new sector classification. I am just curious as the largest REIT, how are you guys thinking about that prospect and anything you intend to do differently going forward, that maybe positioning yourself maybe differently in the eyes of that newer larger pocket of capital. David Simon : Well you know I think we\u2019re going to be explaining the company in what we do and how they all look at us. The good news of that group is they look at cash flow growth. They look at earnings growth. They look at balance sheet metrics, you know they will compare us to other industries as opposed to just within our sector they won\u2019t\u2019 be thoroughly focused on NAV, which again I you know we can argue about. They won\u2019t worry about a quarter here or there of our retail sales. They are going to look at what kind of growth we have in our cash flow, in our earnings and I think that plays perfectly well with us given the kind of earnings growth that we\u2019ve had over many many many years and many different cycles. So we are very focussed on trying to solicit them, whether or not they are going to be interested and whether or not that\u2019s going to be whole new category, I mean we have no particular crystal ball on that front. But if they do look at us, I think we\u2019ve got a great story to tell and they are going to look at earnings and cash flow growth and they know that we have hard assets which never hurt in any cycle. They have hard physical assets. Jeff Donnelly : Thanks guys. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Paul Morgan : Hi good morning. David I guess maybe in light of kind of all your caution on the macro and the consumer I\u2019d see if might Rick could offer a little sunshine [ph] and give some of the concepts where we are seeing expansion and maybe kind of particularly in the kind of the mall expansions and redevelopments that you are doing, number one. And then kind of the number two, for anchor spaces where you might be looking to replace a department store. Rick Sokolov : Well first on the department store side, it is important to note we have one vacant department store in the entire portfolio and we have like 441 of them. So again, the narrative out there would have you believe something very different and when David implied earlier just as to what we think is going to happen with these department stores that was a very informed opinion because we meet with these guys all the time, and that\u2019s what they are telling us. If you look at the activity that we put in the K we have significant number of anchors that are coming into the portfolio, David always makes fun of me when I list them, so I won't. David Simon : No, please do. Rick Sokolov : Fine. There is a lot going in and there are across the portfolio quality wise in terms of the smaller properties the more productive, the slightly less productive and they are all getting better. And if you just follow our momentum we had 19 added in 2015, we are now up to 35 in 2016. And it's across the gammit of restaurants, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales. Brand new Saks is opening this week at Houston Galleria and what is spectacular state of the art store. And as we had new space, that enables us to accommodate the new cutting edge retailers that otherwise we would not be able to accommodate and they are still looking to expand at productive properties. And so that is ongoing, and there\u2019s basically if you step back, we are seeing demand from international retailers come to this market, from new retail concepts like suite supply and [indiscernible] from retailers opening stores that\u2019s been talked about a lot. Brand extension of our existing retailers that white barn candle is growing aggressively. Victoria\u2019s Secret is growing 4% this year. We have, we are adding restaurants as David said throughout the portfolio and all of this is just making the portfolio stronger and stronger. David Simon : And again, we put in page 21 to show you what the fruits of our efforts produce. And I believe the portfolio NOI which doesn\u2019t include our corporate activity increased 7.8% for the quarter you know as my favourite guy that I love to quote Adam Sandler would say that ain\u2019t too shabby. So you know we are conservative but it\u2019s not getting in the way of producing results we want to produce. Paul Morgan : And then, just on the -- the kind of the team segment, if we do get a ramp up in closings I mean, obviously closings are a lot of these chains have been going on for a lot of years. But let's say it ramps up. A lot of the chains themselves don't seem to be producing kind of sales at the volume of on a square foot basis that kind of your portfolio average is. Is there a pretty strong positive mark-to-market on that space? I mean would we expect spreads to be consistent if you get hundreds of closings that can bring in more productive retailers, or is that not the way to look at it? David Simon : Well I think if you look at our activity generated last year where we have Wet feel and Cache [ph] and body shop go out, we have been able to release a very significant amount of space at positive rents and positive productivity contributions because there are more productive retailers coming in. So there are going to be downtimes certainly. Will that have an impact on short term results, of course but at the end we certainly demonstrated an ability to replace those retailers that go out with better retailers and frankly that hasn\u2019t changed for decades, that\u2019s the business. Paul Morgan : Great. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning everyone. Just two questions from us. First of all on the development and the redevelopment side of the business, just noticed a couple of yield change. The yields for the new development and the premium outlets went down a little bit, and also expected yields on the mills redevelopment went down a little bit. Is that purely due to mix? David Simon : Yes, yes. So in the outlets we added our Canadian deal which changed the mix and then there were a couple of changes in the mills mix. But no budget below, there is no income below, it\u2019s all just mix changes. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. That's helpful. And then second of all in regards to Sears, Kmart, some announcements this week or last week that they are accelerating closures, just wondering what you think the implication of that would be going forward either for your portfolio or also in regards to your JV with Sears? David Simon : Well as far as we know and I think it\u2019s pretty safe statement, none of those closing are in any of our assets, so that has no impact and you know if it makes Sears a healthier retailer we are all for that. I mean it really doesn\u2019t impact our Sears card [ph] JV or our relationship with Sears. I mean, I think it\u2019s -- you know we are still doing business as usual there. Tayo Okusanya : So it doesn't [Indiscernible] accelerate the ability for you to make a couple of changes in regards to Sears moving out of some of the -- type space and you are redeveloping and leasing that space? David Simon : No its not been changed given that recent announcements. We have no K marts in our portfolio. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty much business as usual there. We still obviously spend in a lot of time going through our JVs to redevelop some of those boxes. So that\u2019s not -- no different sense of pace or not given the recent Sears announcement. Rick Sokolov : And I would like to point out the vast majority of those stores that Sears announced as closing were K marts and free standing stores. I believe there is only one or two mall based stores in that entire list, none of which were ours. Tayo Okusanya : Great. Thank you. David Simon : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open. Carol Kemple : Good morning. Earlier in the call you all mentioned that you think some of the best opportunities for many of the online retailers are opening in physical stores. What kind of feedback have you received from the online retailers who have already opened stores at your malls? David Simon : Positive. Very positive, the cost of customer acquisition we would encourage you to read the L2 study that we produced the cost of customer acquisition for pure online retailer at a certain level if they don\u2019t have physical stores is so high that they all view physical stores as a way to really reduce their customer acquisition cost, extend the branding, extend the reach. And so far its seems to be producing what they -- what they are looking to get out of that. So far, so good there. Carol Kemple : Are you starting to see some of them that maybe you signed 10 leases with in the beginning looking to enter into more of your malls, or are they kind of content with the space they have right now? David Simon : No they are all; they are all looking to expand. Carol Kemple : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. So I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions on occupancy cost. For new leases that you are signing, what do the occupancy costs look like, and I think when I asked this question last time you said around 14% to 15%. I was curious if that needle is moving closer to 15% or 14% lately? David Simon : You know it\u2019s so specific retailer space specific, but I think the important think if we look at our base \u2013 our average base land we are its still under 10% well under 10% what the sales are, our averages means a lot because you know we have the vast portfolio. You can see the role over schedule, there is no one -- there is just no way I can really answer that question. It\u2019s so specific on location, mall, retailer use someone and so forth, but we are increasing our average base rents and our spreads are spreads and comp NOI or comp NOI. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. I guess I was asking if there were any more general trends you were noticing if things were changing at all. But, I guess my second question is how will you treat Tesla sales in your report stats if they are going to be in there at all? David Simon : Well if they report sales, they are in. If they don\u2019t they are not. I mean we have that policy with every retailer. The Good, the bad the indifferent. Ki Bin Kim : I mean so with that, does that mean that their sales would eventually be included? David Simon : I just said, if they report sales, they are in. If they don\u2019t they are not and just as every retailer under 10,000 fee again I mean and I think they report in a couple, I think they don\u2019t report and the most of them. And so again given the size of our portfolio it\u2019s immaterial Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : We -- as you know we have hundred and -- how many together. How many Tom, how many malls do we have? Tom Ward : 107. David Simon : And how many outlets that we\u2026 Tom Ward : Seven. David Simon : So you know none of this one particular retailer is going to change it all that much. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao : Hey, just a couple of cleanup questions here. In terms of the other income, which I know we talked about inclusive of the resi gains if we take out that impact, it seems like it is about $52 million or so for the quarter, which is similar to fourth quarter but up quite a bit year-over-year. Just curious if that\u2019s a decent run rate going forward or if there was some other -- there is a bunch of things in that line item? Just wondering if there is other one time? David Simon : I just think you know you\u2019re going to have to get used to the fact that it\u2019s going to have ups and downs in that number over the year it kind of balances this out. You know we generated a lot of additional income from our portfolio and we are hoping that that will grow. I\u2019d say overall that number is around $200 million but it could be you know -- but it could be higher one quarter, lower in the next. It could be higher over the whole year or a little lower over one year and it\u2019s just a number that\u2019s going to be volatile. Again, we\u2019re -- our total revenue base is, Steve, when you had included our share the JV $8 billion of revenue. You know we a big company, so it\u2019s not you know it -- these things are going to go in and out a little bit. But the good news is its income, it\u2019s not losses. Okay. Vincent Chao : Right. Okay. And just, maybe not a question -- if I missed it from earlier. On the 5.1% same-store NOI comp in the quarter it was quite a bit stronger than last sort of couple of quarters that you reported. Again, obviously we just talked about the ins and outs on a quarterly basis. Just curious, though, if there was anything surprising here in the first quarter for you guys relative to your initial outlook on the quarter\u2026 David Simon : Not really. We don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t update our comp NOI quarter-over-quarter. We told you what we felt we would do. We are always trying to achieve better than that. Last year we didn\u2019t. We came in a little bit under what we had wanted to see in comp NOI, that was all related to the unanticipated to at least to the degree in our overage rent due to the decrease in tourism spending, yet we produced our good earnings despite that headwind. All of that\u2019s explained in my shareholder letter. But we don\u2019t update it, we are hopeful to do better than that. Then we guided to early in the year and you know we\u2019ll see. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one last question on the anchor openings. I think there was about four backstages that opened this quarter. Just curious if you could provide some color on what you were seeing from that particular concept. Rick Sokolov : While those backstages that open were done in existing Macy stores and if you look at how they are integrated into the store, they were basically taking one for side and one parking field and branding it, Macy\u2019s backstage and it\u2019s I think too early to say what kind of sales impact it has, but it is another reason for consumers to come to that store and hopefully it will contribute the kind of positive sales impact that they are looking for. But the physical presentation of it is basically a dedicated entrance and a dedicated portion of one floor of an existing Macy store. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you. Rick Sokolov : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Hi. Just have one quick one last, what was the dollar volume of dispositions that you announced including the residential? David Simon : The total, not to gain the total amount -- can do quick add 65 million somewhere in that including the outlet that we sold. Michael Mueller : Okay. That was it. Thank you. David Simon : No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. I appreciate hearing some additional comments helped answers my first questions how things have changed in the last year. I guess thinking about it David, would you consider disclosing the latest occupancy cost of sales for the outlets just to demonstrate the ability to continue to push rents further, or at this point you are just combining it with the malls? David Simon : We\u2019ve always we\u2019ve combined them for the last several years. I mean, any -- look I think all of this metrics manifest itself in the cash flow and comp NOI. And we are not as obsessed with metrics as maybe the analytic community that could be good or that could be bad, but that just a way we look at things. We also take a longer term view of the real estate that we do on a quarter-by-quarter and even year-by-year view. So I don\u2019t think that data is going to do you any good, frankly it\u2019s not something we are like obsessed with what\u2019s the occupancy cost going to be you know on this particular deal with this particular tenant on how we run the business. We are looking at retail mix with a primary purpose that the retailer does well and the consumer likes it and then if that works together then hopefully it will create the environment that we are trying to do which by the way we are not -- you know we are decent at, good at. We are not great at, we can always do better. So another metric it\u2019s just you know we just -- it\u2019s just not where we want you to think about us. We want you to think about our cash flow growth, our investment and our assets over the long term and so on. But all I can tell you is the outlet business comp NOI growth is doing very well and we don\u2019t see a change in that even with the tourism slowdown that we are currently experiencing. Now we are -- our portfolio NOI grew 7.8% with top tourism spend and a slow growth economy. That\u2019s pretty good work. I can\u2019t guarantee we are going to do it every quarter, but I think that\u2019s pretty good work. That\u2019s what I like you to focus on. Jeff Spector : Okay. Sounds good. And then my last question is just on retailer CapEx tenant allowance. Any change there as we think about whether -- how you are signing deals or some of your competitors? Is that increasing for some, decreasing? Is it similar to what we have seen in the past? Rick Sokolov : Now if you look in the Q [ph] our allowance has been flat year-over-year and frankly all that allowance is just for new tenants. We have minimal allowance for our renewal. Jeff Spector : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Rick Sokolov : No worries. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citibank. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Yes, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. David, I am curious, as you think about all the investments you are making in the mall of the future, how do you think effectively the return on that capital will come? Do you think it is going to come direct from the consumer to you, or do you think it is going to come in the form of better sales, better productivity, better margins of your tenants and therefore higher rents that are able to be paid to you. And maybe just talk about where we are in sort of your view about how close we are to this mall of the future that you envision? David Simon : Well I think we are still in the very early stages. I mean, I wish we were more along that curve, but it\u2019s you know it\u2019s not easy. I would say to you first, but there\u2019s lots of things we are experimenting with and you know I continue to think that as we do those investments that the consumer will appreciate them and it will lead to more traffic and more visits and more browsing which is very important. I would say to you that the -- I don\u2019t necessarily see, I see it more as creating a better environment which will lead to all the benefits of that as opposed to the consumer is going to pay us for it. The consumer, frankly as we all know is getting a lot of stuff subsidized right now because of what\u2019s going on in the broader world, you know delivery returns just to name a couple. So I see it more as creating an environment that\u2019s going to drive traffic and lead to you know more demand from retailers wanting to be in those places where traffic is. And more demand I think relates to for us hopefully we\u2019ll be able to generate more cash because you know supply and demand is important in every industry and obviously very important in the real estate industry. So, I think it\u2019s more of that. But I wouldn\u2019t rule out that the consumer but I think it\u2019s more creating the appropriate environment if -- to give you a simple answer to that. And I\u2019d say, we are early days in that but you know we are hopeful, we are hopeful to continue to improve the environment. Michael Bilerman : I am curious how much buying you have from the retailers to sort of experimenting and bringing more experience based things to their stores and, clearly doing all this stuff in terms of parking and direct on the consumer side to get them to come to the mall. But is there some retailers that are being better partners in terms of just trying to drive that increased traffic? Rick Sokolov : Yes I think they are all very focused on it. I think the relationship on that front is excellent. We are getting a lot of cooperation buy end. It obviously depends on the sophistication of the retailer and you know frankly they are very busy too. But the good news is when we describe to them what we are trying to achieve and how they can play a role in, you know they are all very receptive. But they are also all very busy as well. So it\u2019s for us it\u2019s prioritizing the biggest thing for the buck making it easy as possible in terms of plug and play almost to use a technology, terminology we can deliver that to the retailer that\u2019s a lot easier. I mean it gets a little gruesome with the details which I\u2019ll spare you and me and everybody else on the call to go into that level but I think they are being excellent. They have been very cooperative and we all want to drive traffic to the physical world and we all see the benefit of that and you know we\u2019ll continue to experiment plug along here. Michael Bilerman : Great. And thanks for the NOI disclosure. Rick Sokolov : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum : Thank you. Could you --your gross international NOI exposure is 8% today. What is your net exposure, and would you consider expanding your international NOI based on low interest rates that offer in both Europe and in Japan? And in particular, when you look at your European outlets platform, do you think you can expand that by another 3 million square feet over the next five years? David Simon : Well, look I think we do want to expand our Asian premium outlet portfolio, but we only want to do it when there is a supply and demand and that we don\u2019t want to do it because of low interest rates. And I we feel strongly about our McArthurGlen relationship as well and the good news is having been back and forth to see the MGE folks twice in the last I don\u2019t know four or five weeks. They have a very good pipe. So the answer there is yes, we want to build out their pipe in Continental Europe and the U.K. and we certainly wanted, we certainly got a handful of opportunities in Asia as well and listen, the low interest rate certainly make it easier in a sense but it\u2019s always supply and demand, can we lease the building? That\u2019s -- can we lease the building and at what rent? On your net question, you are asking from a hedging point of view, I wasn\u2019t really sure what you meant by the gross versus the net, so maybe if I could ask you again that? Floris van Dijkum : Sure. It is both on an asset and obviously you are partly hedged through local debt, but also on an epical contribution in terms of your interest expense in local currencies. What\u2019s your interest -- what is your currency risk in that income on both the asset as well as the income side? David Simon : Well we certainly hedged; we are in the high 90s in terms of our investment. And so that\u2019s hedged. But you know given you can see the NOI contribution, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s real dollars once converted obviously. So there is risk there. And we were not overly leveraged, so you know we\u2019ll make some of it on the interest expense as we mark that to dollars you know on a weighted average quarterly basis, but we have got, they are extremely profitable our debt service ratios are extremely high. So we\u2019ll never be able to hedge the profitability of that and never be able to-- you know we don\u2019t want to hedge over our investment because then you will have that run through the P&L every quarter and I don\u2019t want to do that. We will have the earnings run through the P&L but I don\u2019t want to go outside of currency hedges that would have to be mark to market if we were overhedged. And so we\u2019ve always, we\u2019ve always hedged upto our investment and I think we are in the 90 some odd percent up. I hope I answered your question. Floris van Dijkum : Yes. Partly. The other question I had was regarding your Seritage JV and in particular maybe, Rick, you can talk about, do you and your partner have similar views on the capital required to redevelop those boxes? Rick Sokolov : Certainly we have identical vision as to the potential for those boxes. Each of us are going to have to deal with the funding of that when the time through their own sources, but they fully recognize that and we do not perceive that as an issue. Floris van Dijkum : And when do you expect you are going to start your first project there? Rick Sokolov : We are working with Seritage but also working with Sears because we need to go through the pretty complicated process of downsizing these stores and that\u2019s not a straightforward enterprise. Floris van Dijkum : Okay, thanks. Rick Sokolov : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions for today. So I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to David Simon for closing remarks. David Simon : Thank you for your questions and your interest, we really appreciate it. And we look forward to talking to you in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today\u2019s conference call. This now concludes the program and you may all disconnect your telephone lines at this time. Everyone have a great day.",

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals, and we continue to achieve strong operating and financial results and raised our dividend yet again. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share on a comparable basis excluding a gain on the sale of marketable securities. In the prior year period, FFO per diluted share increased 9.1% or $0.22 year-over-year for the quarter. And for the first six months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up 12.1% compared to the prior year period. Our operating metrics were strong as well as our cash flow. Our mall and premium outlet occupancy was 95.9%. The 20-basis point decrease in occupancy from the prior year period is a direct result due to the new developments and expansions we opened recently. Leasing activity remains healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded releasing spreads of $8.88 per square foot, an increase of 14.8%, and our base minimum rent was $50.43 which was up 4.9% compared to last year, reflecting the strong retail demand for our location. And as a reminder, we provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. Please see this in the supplemental and the release. And for the second quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.4% and has increased 7.6% year-to-date. Our comp NOI increased 3.2% for the quarter and is up 4.1% year-to-date. Total reported retail sales per square foot at our mall and outlets were $6.07 compared to $6.20 in the prior year period. Let me put a couple things in perspective. Reported retail sales continue to be negatively impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Reported sales per square foot for the malls was down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to a retailer and a state with no sales tax, implementing sales restrictions. We mentioned this previously and is important to reiterate and excluding this anomaly, our mall sales per square foot increased for the period. Lower tourism spending continues to impact retail sales at some of our premium outlets. Excluding the negative impact of these high performing tourist-oriented centers, retail reported sales per square foot for the premium outlets was flat. In fact, our traffic in our outlet business thus far is up 2.65% for the year. And finally, the second quarter I'd like to point out that retail sales trends improved progressively with June, recording the strongest monthly sales performance with total sales volume at comparable properties increasing across all of our property types. At the end of the quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across the platforms. Our share is $1.4 billion. We continue to expand, transform, enhance our properties. We completed Stanford Shopping Center. And over the next several weeks, we'll complete a number of other transformative and redevelopments including the completion of the connector at King of Prussia that will link the court and the plaza, creating 50 new specialty stores, a comprehensive redevelopment expansion to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, a densification of Phipps Plaza with the completion of AC Hotel by Marriott and multi-family residential units. We're also underway with the transformation of La Plaza in McAllen, Texas where we demolished the former Sears box, are under construction on an expansion wing that will accommodate up to 50 specialty stores, four junior anchors and exciting new dining plaza, all of these are accretive returns. We'll continue to flow and fuel our profitability and construction includes among others, but not an exhaustive list, Woodbury Common, Sawgrass Mills, The Galleria in Houston and on. Our new development is focused on important markets where demand is there. During the quarter, we opened a new Tanger Outlet in Columbus. It's off to a great start. It's been a partnership with Steve. Our construction continues on our new outlet in Clarksburg, Maryland which will open in the fourth quarter of this year. We also recently broke ground on a new outlet Norfolk, Virginia which will open in mid-2017. We've got exciting projects in \u2013 outside the U.S. We have an outlet under construction in Provence, France, South Korea and Canada, all will open in 2017, also fueling our growth. We also recently started construction in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with Genting who is our partner in our other Malaysia asset. And construction is nearing completion at Brickell Centre in Miami. The center is almost entirely leased with 80 retailers and restaurants coming to projects. And we're also continuing construction with our high end retail projects in Fort Worth, anchored by Neiman The Shops at Clearfork. Acquisitions beyond Crystals, we also bought our partner out in our Naples and Venice outlets. So we now effectively own 90% of these two great assets. We completed \u2013 turning to capital markets. We completed a successful euro senior offering, \u20ac500 million at 1.25% for nine years. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion, and we have an industry leading balance sheet as we hope you know. We increased our dividend 6.5% year-over-year, 3% from the second quarter and we'll pay at least $6.50 which will be 7% over last year. We've also increased our guidance from $10.77 to $10.85. This reflects solid performance in the first half. In our current view, the remainder of the year, we are very pleased with our performance. Questions are available. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, thank you. David, you referenced that there was a pickup in June relative to some of the other months. Do you think that we will start to see the annualization of the international shopper pullback? And will that have less of an impact in the numbers going forward? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look I think it's hard to predict, Craig. It's good to see the June sales for our retailers were up. We're starting to see the stronger dollar anniversary, so it'll have less impact on the metrics, but I think more importantly, we're seeing other than the anomaly I talked about in the one \u2013 with the one state, our sales were fine and the portfolio outside the tour centers, sales are fine. And we're operating pretty effectively in a very slow growth U.S. economy. So the anniversary impact is coming up in the next few months. We're starting to see it stabilize, but it's very hard to predict. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then you've expanded your presence obviously in Las Vegas with Crystals, I just wondered if there would be differing strategies going forward, where you might take Forum Shops one direction and Crystals in another? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think they're \u2013 as you know, Vegas, there's so much tourism there, I mean 50 million visitors a year. Each has its own distinct separate marketplace. They, obviously Forum Shops is bigger. It caters to not only a high end consumer, but also a broader consumer. Crystals is more luxury oriented. So I think they both have distinct markets. We'll continue to take advantage of those great assets, and continue to drive the income up in both. So I don't think there'll be a huge change in strategy, but a continuation of improving operations in both assets. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, David. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Hi. Look, I know a lot of the metrics were fairly positive. I guess the one that just sort of jumped out was sort of the rolling 12 month leasing spread which had a noticeable drop from 17.5% to just under 15%. Is there anything that sort of happened in this quarter that would have pulled that number down, and what do you think is a reasonable expectation going forward? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, again, I respect that everyone loves to focus on operating metrics, as you \u2013 you know me pretty well, Steve. What's the one operating metric that I focus on? Is this the question? Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : I know you \u2013 total NOI growth and total sales? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I look at cash flow growth, my friend, okay. So the other thing that I'd like to point out on that is that we put our entire bucket of activity in that number. I don't know what others do but \u2013 so, if we have as an example lease amendments, let's say we have a retailer that we have to restructure because we figure, well, let's keep him in, and operating while we'll ultimately release the space. That amendment goes into that spread. And, if there's anything \u2013 again, I'm pleased with the spread. I think we've so much outperformed on our spread that that number of 15% is pretty damn good, $8.88 over ending rent for new rent is pretty damn good. But put that aside, if you are looking to grasp on anything, I would say it's somewhat affected by the fact that we have amendments due to some of the retailer situations that we've been dealing with over the last 12 months. I'm very pleased with the spread. $9 is a good number in a flat economy. I also \u2013 you look at our comp NOI which is where I'm focused on cash flow growth. You look at our comp NOI, we haven't just had a couple of years of good numbers, we've had a decade of outperformance versus our peer group. And as you know, when you comp over a comp over a comp over a comp, that's pretty damn good. So we're very pleased with the number. If you want to point out something which I know is your job to do, I would say it's more the amendments which we view is something that we're doing in a very slow economic growth environment in the U.S. And we're dealing with that effectively and yet we're still producing very healthy spreads. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess, just secondly, in terms of sort of recapturing some of the department stores and the JVs that you got with Seritage, can you just sort of provide an update on sort of where you stand and the opportunities that you see over the next couple of years to maybe recapture some more boxes? Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Steve, Rick Sokolov. We have continued to work with Seritage and Sears. We've got users identified for our properties in Seritage. As we mentioned last quarter, we're working with Sears just on how to downsize their stores, and that process is ongoing. I will tell you, if you look over the years, we recaptured 93 department stores and we've done a very effective job of deploying them. If you look at our anchor schedule, we have been going on right now, it's an ongoing process. We have a whole team dedicated to it. And the good news is we have substantial demand identified in each of our properties, so we know how we're going to deal with any of these stores that we do get the opportunity to recapture. David talked about La Plaza which was a Sears store. We got a Sears store back at College Mall. Now demolished and we're adding 365 Whole Foods, Ulta, small shops and restaurants. We're making money and making the properties better. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, good morning. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: As you look at the development and redevelopment pipeline, you've got $2.1 billion your share of cost for the projects that are going now and almost that in CIP (17:33), how should we think about kind of beyond the projects that are kind of in place right now, what the shadow pipeline looks like? I mean you talked about it is a tougher environment. I mean do think that this could be a peak that would slow going forward as some of these project completions roll off looking into next year or do you think you've got a shadow pipeline that's going to keep it going at around this level? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me answer it this way. We actually had a meeting yesterday on Sawgrass Mills and Jersey Gardens is just two examples that together would be $500 million to $600 million of redevelopment. So we're very comfortable and confident, Paul, that even the retail \u2013 the retail sales have been anemic this year that when you have properties like that that can't be expanded. We have the appropriate amount of demand to make financial \u2013 make the financial consequences very positive for the company in addition to making those properties even more important. So I don't think we're backing off at all or redevelopment and expansion of portfolio. The good news is we have such a good number of high quality assets that we'll continue to find opportunities to expand them. And I like I said, I mean Jersey Gardens and Sawgrass are just two simple examples that pope to mind, but that's going to be $500 million to $600 million spread and will be hopefully delivered in 2019-ish, maybe 2020-ish. And we'll continue to enhance their marketplace position. So we haven't really changed. I think if we've changed anything is \u2013 and I mentioned, I think the last call or call before that, we put a lot in the system and that's kind of a little bit about \u2013 you saw the 20-basis point getting out. You might react to 20 basis points decrease in occupancy, I assure you I do not, okay. I assure you I do not. But let's \u2013 but we put a lot in the system over the last whatever six months, primarily in the outlet that we've decided to spread some of those new ground up developments out a little bit so that we don't stress the system. And we get the lease-up that we want in those. But our strategy really hasn't changed. And I think we've got plenty of opportunities continue to enhance our portfolio. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then my other question, you've talked about and you provided a list of, pretty long list of e-retailers who are looking to open stores in your malls. And I wonder if you have an update on kind of how those rollouts are being received, whether some of these retailers might be initially opening three or four, these could become 20 or 30 or 40 or kind of how it's been playing out so far? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well. I'll let Rick do his list, and I appreciate you giving him the opportunity because he loves to read his list. I will say this though, there's so much creative stuff going on with new ideas, new concepts that as a simple example, we did a pop-up store with Woodbury Commons with Rent the Runway, where they actually sold some of their existing inventory. And it had unbelievable success. I'm not going to tell you how much they sold because I don't frankly know if I'm allowed to or whatever. But there's a lot of creativity and a lot e-tailers that want access to the physical world, and that's just a small example of a unique idea. I actually happen to meet with the CEO and said, do a pop-up store at Woodbury, okay. They did it, they had a great success. But now I'll turn it over to Rick to give you the list. Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: The other thing I would tell you is there have been a number of them and we listed them. Obviously, you've \u2013 we talked about Fabletics, Birchbox, Yogasmoga. Everyone understands what the dynamic is going with Amazon. We just made a deal with UNTUCKit. The most important aspect of this is that all of these retailers that have Internet presence understand that a bricks-and-mortar presence in an essential part of their strategy. They get much higher conversion in their store. Their customer acquisition is frankly cheaper, and it's something that we're seeing more and more. We're working with frankly scores of them to come to our properties. It's certainly going to be a source of growth for us going forward in the out years. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And the condition on doing that deal was that Rick could not wear the UNTUCKit shirt, okay. Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: All brand negative (23:33) David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. And so it's in the lease. Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open. Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. David, earlier you mentioned lease amendments having a bit of an impact on releasing spreads. Obviously, you're taking a selective approach here. But I was just wondering if \u2013 more generally are you seeing an increased level of tenants coming to you, looking for lease amendments or would it more or less be consistent with the prior couple years? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's really \u2013 I mean obviously there's some high level news out there with certain retailers. And it's really more of that category than just the person here and a person there. So it's kind of what you've seen. We have less year-to-date bankruptcies than we did last year, but so some of that's just rolling through the numbers that we had to deal with last year. Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just sticking with leasing here, obviously, more sales moving online and not maybe getting captured in your sales or occupancy cost figures. I'm just wondering, are you exploring any changes to your lease structures at all at this point to better capture and monitor those sales? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, again, our view is to get the market rent that's appropriate for that space. And retail reported and I underscore reported retail sales does not necessarily, as we've had this discussion, correlate to what the market rent for that space is. It's more of a function of location, property, location in the mall, property type, position in the marketplace and so on. So our focus is getting market rent for each and every space and doing it in a way that does not put us at risk with their sales and what we get paid for that space. And that's not changing. Now there's a lot of things going on in the lease in terms of getting credit if they \u2013 the sale \u2013 again this is only a case when you have overage rent and we're hopefully marking at the market where overage rent, they've got to really outperform to pay us overage rent. But in order to \u2013 in their reported sales number, we're negotiating including if it's something fulfilled from the POS system and so on, that it be included in their reported sales number. But again, our focus is more on what the market rent for that space is as opposed to necessarily what the tenants' sales are going to be out of that space. Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC : Good. Appreciate the color. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning. You kind of touched on it earlier, but you guys have two ground-up outlets in process now for being developed in Virginia and Maryland and a number of full-price mall expansions going on. So how would you describe the demand for that space either outlet versus full-price or either one versus itself a year or two ago? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would say to you that the only \u2013 first of all, Clarksburg is going to \u2013 I mean Columbus, where we partnered with Tanger was 100% leased I think, maybe there's a couple of vacancies. So that was not impacted at all. We've got Clarksburg, where I think, it's going to be a great development, opens up in Q4. We've got \u2013 in that case, we are bringing in a very, what I'd call a high end mix, because we really kind of want that to be ultimately kind of the Woodbury \u2013 this is an over exaggeration, so don't hold me to it, but we wanted to kind of be the high end fashion outlet for the mid-Atlantic more or less. And so there's \u2013 those retailers sometimes getting them to commit to a new outlet is a little longer process, because in a lot of cases, they don't manufacture for it and it's a function of their full-price strategy. I won't bore you with all the ins and outs of that, but that's going to deliver \u2013 we're going to deliver a great mix, and I think the demand has been excellent and we're going to hold a couple of spaces just to fill out the kind of the unique mix there and I'd say that the \u2013 I'd say the outlet demand for new product is good. It's not \u2013 it really hasn't changed. The only thing that I would say for new projects is the luxury-oriented folks are taking a little bit of a more \u2013 a little bit of a breather \u2013 a lot of that because of what's going on with tourism. So that's a little bit what I'd call softer than it might have been a year plus ago. But not material as evidenced by the mix that we're producing at Brickell which is going to be a great project that the three partners have worked very hard to produce. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then it seems like over the past couple years, some kind of bright spots at the mall in terms of who's been opening and who's been doing well that you and your peers have talked about includes fast-fashion and restaurants. So was just wondering if those types of mall tenants are still generally looking to have larger stores or more stores or just generally doing maybe better than the other apparel type guys? Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Hi, this is Rick. We are continuing to very much focus on the addition of restaurants and food throughout the portfolios. There is still a considerable amount of demand. Just to let you know, last five years, we've added almost 200 restaurants across our portfolio. We had 25 last year. We have another 53 scheduled to open this year and next year. And so they're also finding substantially increased productivity when they are associated with our projects as opposed to a freestanding pad and that has certainly helped that demand. In terms of the other tenants you alluded to. Certainly, the international tenants are continuing to grow. We've got and we've already talked about e-tailers, we've got brand extensions. There is still considerable demand for our space, and we're doing okay. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, as Rick said, the restaurant demand is great. Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Yes. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning out there. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. We are out here. We are out here in the Great Midwest. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Increasingly important part of the country this year. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You bet, you. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : So just a few questions here, David. First, you guys obviously disclosed your rent spreads, and those sort of stats, and stay up (31:55), but can you give a little bit more color on sort of same-center ancillary income growth. As you guys have rolled out that program, is it still growing, is the growth really coming from rolling out more and more ancillary at each mall, or is it more or that maybe you've maxed out individual malls, so that more of the growth is coming as you roll out different programs to new malls and outlets too? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would \u2013 let me give you just a big picture view. I would say, it's actually in the \u2013 when you ancillary a lot of \u2013 put kind of our SPV effort to a side, we've actually reduced it pretty significantly in our high end portfolio. So we've cleaned out what I'll call a lot of stuff. And again, we think that's the right thing to do. It's maybe, it's clearly costing us some income, but at the end of the day, we think it's the right thing to do. So, if you look at kind of our high end portfolio, we've cleaned a lot of stuff out. And we're very sensitive to creating the environment where those retailers can do the most business. So, if anything, we've suffered dilution, and you know how I love cash flow but I've got to do \u2013 I've got to balance that. So we've actually reduced that and that's hurt us over the last few quarters. In the outlet business, it's probably picked up a little bit. So there again \u2013 there is an answer for everything, but I think we've done a \u2013 we put in some, what I'd call, veteran mall people to kind of run that business over the last couple years, and they've actually done a pretty nice job, increasing those ancillary. So, up in outlet, down in the high end malls, pretty significantly, and I think the rest of it's kind of commensurate with the marketplace. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Can you \u2013 but as far as the reduction at the high end malls, can you just give sort of a magnitude like a percentage like if you had a \u2013 was it a 5% reduction to overall ancillary income, 10% when you look in the aggregate what you guys do? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's enough for me to notice, but we put it all in our numbers and our numbers are our numbers, so I don't want to get into what amount, but it's been \u2013 it could be \u2013 let me frame it this way a little bit. It could be, at a big mall, $1 million bucks, how's that? How's that if you really want to pinpoint the \u2013 on something. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : $1 million...? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, at a big mall. At a big mall, it could be $1 million. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : So $1 million going away? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, no. At a big mall \u2013 at one big mall. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So we've done it at a handful of malls, but at a big mall, it can be $1 million. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. That's helpful. Second question is, just looking at your European portfolio, obviously, a lot of unfortunate tragic events that have occurred, what has been the impact at the retail level? Have \u2013 is it people are going forward and life goes on or have you seen any impact to either tenant openings or sales or anything like that or maybe just increased expenses from things that have to be done? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, in our ownership interest again, we have basically two ways we operate in, in Europe. We own properties through \u2013 primarily through McArthurGlen. And then we have our ownership interest in Kl\u00e9pierre. Kl\u00e9pierre is a public company. I think they reported today. And their numbers have been pretty good, look at retail sales. The only country that I'd say which is not insignificant here that's a little bit underperforming, but still up, is in France. And I don't know that I'd necessarily equate that to the \u2013 what's happened terrorist-wise, but just France general economy is a little bit behind, say Italy, Spain and the Netherlands and Scandinavia and so on. So but that's \u2013 all that data is out there for you. I think their business is actually pretty decent and they chug along. We see no impact whatsoever in our McArthurGlen portfolio. Look, they have \u2013 their assets are in a lot of cases tourist-oriented. And so if tourism changes they'll have that you'll see that impact a little bit. But we haven't seen it so far. Their numbers have been pretty impressive year-to-date. Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Thanks a lot, David. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning, Michael Bilerman as well. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just a follow-up on the department store recapture. To what extent do you think we'll continue to see department store closings? And how do you think about sort of the economics of redeveloping a box like that in terms of the cost per square foot of the redevelopment and then looking at sort of the rent that you can get on new tenants versus the increased rents of the department stores currently there? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Christy, first off, all of our recapture activity has been included in all of our development yield tables. And I think we've said that we work it out and we get comparable yield that we can get in the rest of our development projects. There's a range from the high single-digit, low double-digit. We've identified the boxes and every deal is unique as to what the costs would be for redeveloping the box. Is it a full box user, are we splitting the box? How the box is configured? But all of those yields are in and the most important thing is that we've been able to produce our results and we've had a great deal of activity in that sector as witnessed by all the anchors that we continue to add across the company. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And are you closer to executing on some of the Seritage deal? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry, could you repeat that? Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Are you closer to executing on some of the Seritage projects that you've discussed... David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're again working with Sears on the economics and configuration of their downsizes. As soon as we have that in place, we'll be able to proceed. We have identified and have firmed up commitments for the vast majority of those boxes. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, David, it's Michael Bilerman. I had a quick question on the balance sheet. Back at our conference in March, you talked about wanting to sort of hoard more capital at this stage, rather than spending a lot of capital. And if you look at the balance sheet today, it's the best it's ever been in your entire history. You talk about $6 billion of liquidity and significant amount of balance sheet capacity and unbelievable cost of capital. How should we interpret that position? And is it gearing up to be able to be opportunistic in the next cycle or still within this cycle? And how should we think about the capital that you have? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, I love being in the spot that we're in. We have no plans. As you know, we said it publicly, we're out of the big deal business. I mean I reserve the right to change my mind I guess. But if you ask me today, I'm out of the big deal business. Eventually, as we all know, there's going to be cycles in our \u2013 in economic world that we live in. And Rick and I are grizzled veterans, when it comes to real estate, recessions and stuff. I mean so it's always good to be in that spot. Obviously, Andy is here. We've worked very hard to be in that spot. It allows us to grow our dividend. It allows us to put capital back into the business that feeds on itself. So I think pretty much nothing's changed, Michael, it's business as usual. We have no intention of really doing anything with that other than continuing to build that. And I don't if there'll be a cycle. I have no idea, but we are out of the big deal business and we're going to maintain that kind of liquidity and capital, primarily to \u2013 that's the balance sheet we want. We think that should be valued by the market. I'll let you decide whether it is or isn't. I don't know and it allows us to reinvest in our portfolio. I think the one thing that that we all talk about physical retail and we talk about physical real estate and I don't care of what, whether it's an office, a hotel, a mall or strip center, if you don't have a good looking product and you're not, your customer's not going to show up. And if you're \u2013 if you got an apartment building, you got an office building, you got a mall, you got a strip center, you got a physical retail store, if it doesn't look good and then it's not, doesn't have the right services, and it doesn't have the right tenant mix or clientele, you're going somewhere down the road, that's the competitive society that we live in. And I think our capital allows us to try. We don't execute this the way, I think we can continue to be better, much better in this. But our balance sheet allows us to have a really, really, really good looking physical product and we've got a lot of work to continue to make it even better, better, better. And I would encourage anybody that owns physical real estate or leases physical real estate, that's our goal, that's our job. You got to have \u2013 I mean, just like if you're Boeing, and you're manufacturing airplanes, you go to their manufacturing facility, I guarantee it's state-of-the-art beautiful, and that's what they do with their capital. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Right. And you're still earning very good returns on that incremental investment so it's creating a lot of underlying value as well? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And that's why we have the balance sheet that we've got today. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Right. Well, then the question is whether you think there's going to be something bigger from an investment perspective at your assets that you want to position for, right. So being able \u2013 Christy asked about the department stores, whether you'd become much more aggressive at putting a lot of capital and being very aggressive in the near-term to sort of attack that, right, having to \u2013 it's not being out of the big deal business buying someone else, but you can certainly produce something internally with your own space that may require above average capital spend for a period of time? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, look, I think with all the activity there, I think we see that kind of continuing at the pace that it's been. I mean we've been obviously very active the last few years doing that, and lot of this good stuff is coming online. So I think, if outlet new development slows, I mean that's more capital that we can dedicate to getting the box money back. So I kind of see that as a steady state frankly. So, but I don't \u2013 we're not warehousing capital to do some big transaction. It's basically to continue to be a appropriately rated company and continuing to have the capital to invest in our products. That's the goal. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Good morning. Was wondering if you could provide an update on what you're seeing in terms of traffic at your properties, appreciate your comments on the tourist visits, but what else are you seeing in terms of traffic? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you may have missed this. In the outlet business, our traffic is up 2.65% year-to-date, even though spend is down in some of the tourist-oriented centers. Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: On the malls, what we're finding is that the traffic is stable, and interestingly, I know a lot of retailers have reported decreased traffic. What we're seeing is that the consumers are still in our properties, but they are visiting less stores on each visit, and it gets back to David's point about the physical presentation. Our retailers need to have stores that present compelling reasons for these consumers to visit them as they're walking our properties. So there will be less traffic because they're stopping in less stores, but the measures that we look at, the traffic in our properties overall is stable. Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And so, as a follow-up, whose problem is that when it comes to leasing? Does that fall back on the retailer or ultimately you need to attract that retailer as well? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think, listen, we're going to take responsibility as well. The retailer needs too. I think we're all in this together kind of deal. So we've got to have the right retail mix. We've also got to be able to introduce technology in the mall that gets people to visit. I think what Rick was really saying is that with all of the research that's done by consumers and when they go to the mall, they're not probably doing as much window shopping as they probably have done historically. They're more kind of on a mission to \u2013 they know they want to go to these three stores. It's our goal, and obviously the retailers' goal, but it's our goal to get them to spend more time, more time means more spend and visit more stores. We have to take some of that responsibility as well. We're certainly not shirking that. And I think that's where technology can help us do that. Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. And so what specifically are you rolling out and how is that going in terms of... David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we got \u2013 we have much too long of a conversation to do that, but there's a lot of communication that we're doing directly to the consumer that we will hope, we'll hope that it will get the consumer to stay longer as well as visit more stores. The communication helps visit more stores. Staying longer I think is on ambience, a diverse \u2013 more mix, restaurants, entertainment, et cetera, that will help in that cause. Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I know we've talked about the rent spreads earlier, but just curious in the context of the commentary about the overall economy being soft, that's been your commentary for quite some time as well as... David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : By the way, have I been accurate in that? I just want to know. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, you have been accurate. No question there. I guess the question is just around sort of pricing power with your tenants, I mean however you want to define it if rent spread's not necessarily the best metric. Just curious if there's been any change there? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I said rent spreads, somebody asked me a question, I explained to you that we put amendments in our rent spreads, okay. And if I had to isolate \u2013 again, I think the $8.88 is pretty damn good, but if you had to isolate, why wasn't it 17%, it's because of certain amendments where we're taking the decision either to work with the retailer or do it more of on a temporary fashion while we re-lease the space which makes economic sense. And again I would also point out that year-to-date our comp NOI is up 4%, 4.1%. The economy is growing at 1%. I don't know, you tell me what it is. You got a bunch of people on your payroll that will tell you what the economy is growing. Maybe not on your payroll, but on the bank's payroll. And we're outperforming 300 basis points which is not \u2013 You got to put it in perspective, so what's your question? Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I guess the question was regardless of the spread, I mean how are you thinking about pricing power with your tenants today versus maybe six months ago or a year ago? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think every \u2013 we don't have a cookie cutter commodity product. So every deal is different. In some cases, we have pricing power. And frankly, in some cases, we don't because of whatever, competitive situation, bad space, mediocre asset. In some cases, we have great space, great asset, high demand. We put it all in the blender, we produce the results that we produced. And I don't \u2013 I can't answer \u2013 I don't have a cookie cutter answer for you. I mean it is deal-by-deal. We are driven deal-by-deal, space-by-space, lease-by-lease. We've been doing it for a lot of years and that's what we continue to do. And there's just no easy answer I can give to you. Other than all of that dynamics of what I just described, funnel into our numbers, that funnel into the results, and then we declare our results. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's fair enough. Another question just \u2013 in terms of the investment side of things, I know you're out of the big deal business here, and you also said that, you're not really seeing any real impacts in Europe as of yet. But I was just curious if you \u2013 do you expect to see some opportunities open up over there particularly in the UK, obviously, the dollar is strong right now, so it would help the investment case, although I know that's not your focus, but just curious how you're thinking about the investment opportunity over there? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, I think all of those transactions are very difficult. I mean I \u2013 here is my short answer on the UK, so I offered a company who bought an asset, diluted the company's shareholders down by 25%, I offered \u00a34.25, they told me the company was worth \u00a36.50, and the stock today is trading at \u00a32.70, okay. So I'm not enthralled with \u2013 I think the UK \u2013 it's impossible to make deals happen unless somebody wants something to happen. So I'm out of the big deal business. The UK, I've no interest in the UK where \u2013 other than I have a affinity to a football club there that I really love, okay. But, beyond that, I doubt that there'll be any great opportunities in those markets... Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Hi, good morning, guys. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Go back (53:55) if I could to the Seritage stuff that a couple of people have asked about. The first thing, Rick, I'm curious, I thought when these were all set up originally, each of the boxes, there was a specific plan laid out for which part Sears would get and which part Seritage would get. And so are you guys negotiating to try to change that or try to take more of the space, I guess from the Sears... (54:23)? Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: The primary discussion is just on the cost of implementing the agreed upon downsizes. In a couple of instances, the way that we've been able to procure users would make it more efficient for both Sears and us if there were slight reconfigurations, but that's not the issue. It's just a process of, you talk about loading docks and separating air conditioning systems and vertical escalation systems and entrances, it's just a complicated process that we're going through. Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Then I find also then on that, you hint at some point the landlord has to provide Sears with a six-month notice to vacate and then they have six months to actually leave the property, have you guys given or I guess has Seritage given or the joint venture given notice to Sears yet to vacate those various assets? Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: We have not and we will not until we have a firm understanding of what our capital requirements are and what our returns are going to be, and we can't do that until we finalize these discussions. Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. So none of the stores have been given that six-month notice? Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: No. Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then the last thing guys is, do you still own the Seritage stock that you got as part of this whole transaction? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And you plan to keep that I guess, is that the idea? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I mean the plan, plan is a funny word, right. Hard to say, Rich. No real \u2013 just hard to say. Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. All right. Good. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. So just a broader question about market rents for A malls, if look back at a couple two years of leasing activity, you roughly signed rents at $68 of square foot to $70 a square foot, I would think over a two-year period or more, the noise of good spaces versus bad spaces probably gets out of your away with law of large numbers. So just curious, do you think market rents on average for your product has grown recently and what do you think will happen going forward? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we don't \u2013 we give you every year our earnings estimates, our comp NOI estimates, and that's made up of a lot of things, and including our view of what certain spaces are worth and what we think there'll be \u2013 the rents are. So I mean I don't know what else \u2013 I mean, that what else I can tell you that other than what I've already said earlier. We haven't backed off or \u2013 if anything, we've increased our guidance. We haven't backed off our comp or portfolio NOI. We've actually outperformed so far. All that kind of ultimately shows itself kind of our view. And, again, we don't have \u2013 it's not like we can \u2013 it's \u2013 we're not a hotel, so even if we \u2013 our market rent view changed up or down, I don't control the \u2013 they have a lease there. So, again, it's only going to impact, what, 8% of portfolio per year. So we always \u2013 take an example, let's say we got nervous and we cut all these bad deals, wouldn't really impact us at the end of the day because it's only 8% of the portfolio per annum. Now, if you did it several years in a row, we catch up with this. So, again, market rents, it's not \u2013 I don't mark my portfolio up or down every day like I do a hotel business. That's why we have stability of cash flow. That's why we can withstand cycles. That's why we've had this history of comp NOI increases, and I don't know what else I can do other than answer it in that fashion. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. I mean the reason I ask is just trying to gauge the difference between the NOI growth from \u2013 stemming from favorable vintage releasing which is any real estate company versus market rent growth. That's why I asked that question. But my second question is more on leverage. You've always done a little mix of European denominated debt or euro denominated debt versus U.S. I'm assuming that spread has gotten more favorable towards the euro. Any change in larger plans of how to refinance from debt coming due, maybe more geared towards Europe versus here? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I mean we're pretty much hedged on the margin, and so we're not going to get over allocated to euro. We're only going to finance kind of what our investment base there is and we are pretty much hedged. So, if we \u2013 even though there may be a rate differential, we'd have to swap it back to the U.S. dollars because otherwise we would be over allocated and we are, as I said, we're hedged. And that could be something we would look at. But we \u2013 to me, it's a little too cute. I'd rather finance my U.S. assets in U.S. dollars, and my European assets in European dollars, and my Japanese assets in yen, and the currency fluctuations are the currency fluctuations and we have the natural hedge with our investment base. And that's been the strategy. I don't think it'll change. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, just have a couple quick numbers question. One, are there any material Crystal acquisition costs in the quarter? And then, secondly, your occupancy cost was $12.7 million in the quarter. How does that compare to the combined levels that you had in say 2007, 2008? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean I don't have \u2013 the answer is no, and the first one, and then Tom will get back to you on what our occupancy costs in 2007, 2008 is. I don't recall, frankly. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Two quick questions from me. I'm sorry if I missed this previously, but you mentioned about the anomaly with some sort of sales restrictions in a particular state, and again, I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you elaborate on that? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you. And then, secondly, I know you've said you're out of the big deal business, and you said that there's not necessarily opportunities in Europe. But I look at Kl\u00e9pierre and it does look like it's performing well as you mentioned. Would you consider increasing your stake there? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think we're very pleased with the position that we're in. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No more questions from me. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No worries. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Good morning. Just a quick question around the lease amendments that you talked about earlier on that has some impact on releasing spreads. Is there any other detail you can kind of share about those amendments, kind of how they come up, why the decision was made to actually do them? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's a lease-by-lease, store-by-store, mall-by-mall analysis. And I mean we make judgment call, that's what we do every day, judge. Do we want to re-lease it, how, what's the downtime, is \u2013 does it give us time to re-lease it, on and on and on. So it's 50 years of experience that goes into that. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And there is a mix of tenants like large national guys and local guys, and it's like a whole mix of people, that are kind of impacted by that? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's just the nature of our business for many, many years about what the right thing to do is with that retailer in that specific space. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. I'll keep it very short because I know there are some other calls coming up, but David and Rick, quick question. Your vision of the mall in five years, how is the tenant composition today going to change in your view in terms of the percentage of, for example, entertainment as a percentage of the overall mall tenant base? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, the simple answer is there's no cookie cutter answer, and it's all going to be \u2013 the mall business and the retail business, you can have these big overwriting things, but the reality is how it gets executed really focuses on trade area-by-trade area, layout-by-layout, physical configuration-by-physical configuration. And so therefore, there's no overall answer to that, other than simplistically, I think the mix will be more diverse. There will be more entertainment, more food services, more other services, and there'll be technology in it to enhance the shopping experiences. There'll be more services, but how that all gets computed into one particular scenario will depend differently on the North side of Indianapolis versus the South side of Indianapolis. So that's just the nature of our projects, and the good news is we've got an organization that can figure out, I hope the North side of Indianapolis versus the South side of Indianapolis and what's right for that trade area. That's simple answer. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Just curious, what's your favorite football team? David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Crystal Palace. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, worries. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks. David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you and have a good rest of the summer. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

David Simon : Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed opened several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. And we continue to achieve strong financial results. Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our full-year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87 which was higher than our original guidance of $10.70 to $10.80. Our increased range also reflects the potential charge of $0.08 per share with respect to our likely decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower, due to the rapidly rising construction cost and our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market. Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center as well as the development of the Southwest Corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping experience for our guests and retailers and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston and will be completed by summer of \u201817. Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the tower in the future as market conditions warrant. Now let me turn to the quarter. FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year, for the first nine months our comparable FFO per diluted share is at 10.1% compared to the prior year period. We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our mall and premium outlets, ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Leasing activity remained solid. The mall and premium outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share per foot, an increase of 10.9%. Given our high occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing, while not as well located, continues to produce healthy re-leasing spreads. And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases, where we choose to work with retailers in certain situations pre or post-bankruptcy such as PacSun. Base minimum rent was $50.76 up 4.5% compared to last year reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of 13% as well. Now, just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth and I believe this is the most important metric for the investment community focused on. Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the quarter, third quarter. To put our growth rate in perspective, the 7.3% year-to-date growth is more than $300 million. Our results to date keep us on track for our full-year guidance of total NOI growth of more than 6% for our portfolio. On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of growth that contribute to our portfolio of NOI. The diversity of sources, fueling our NOI growth is unique to Simon. Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter, our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our tourists spending at our centers are active in extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences at our properties and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of our highly, of our very high-end portfolio. Total retail sales per square-foot at our malls and premium outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period. Reported retailer centers continued to be impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and premium outlets, reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist oriented centers. Our stable reported sales also include initial dilution from newly opened space and importantly we\u2019re beginning to anniversary some of this decline as you can see, recent sequential quarters Q2 to Q3 of our sales productivity is basically flat. The end of the third quarter redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our platforms. Our share approximately 1.1, we opened as you know, King of Prussia, which connected to the Plaza and the Court. We finished Fashion Center at Pentagon City. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of 120,000 square feet in North Texas. And in the next several weeks we open 60,000 square-foot expansions at the Outlets at Orange. And we also are opening our expansion in Venice Italy with our partner McArthurGlen of 67,000 square feet. So we continue to add value across the portfolio. Now, on new developments, just so happens tomorrow, we\u2019re opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets. The center will offer great retail line-up. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington DC metro area. We currently have five, that\u2019s right, five outlets under construction, one in North Virginia, four in the international markets including France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada, all of these will open in \u201817. And even though we\u2019re opening a new outlet next week, the week after we\u2019re actually opening Brickell City Center in Miami, its anchored Saks. It\u2019s got a great retail line-up with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family and it\u2019s part of a landmark mixed-use development. We look forward to managing the retail and as a reminder we\u2019re only investing in the retail. Construction continues on the full price development at Fort Worth, the Shops at Clearfork, anchored by Neiman Marcus, opening in the fall of \u201817. And these eight new projects represent around $765 million of spend our share. And let me turn to Aeropostale, we\u2019re pleased to have partnered with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco and Gordon Brothers to acquire Aeropostale in addition to the existing management team, the ABG Group will add significant operating experience to Aero. We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions. And after reviewing this opportunity with our partners, we believe this investment will prove to be yet another opportunity for our company. It\u2019s also important to keep this investment in perspective. You\u2019ve all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers and not by our buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group of which, our share is $33 million including working capital. And the only reason we decided to make this investment is because we believe we can make money. If our model is right, we think we\u2019re buying this company at one to two times EBITDA with future growth opportunities ahead of it. And we continue to believe that this will be an astute investment. And for some of you who don\u2019t know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout the years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, just to name a handful. Also during the quarter, we acquired our partners\u2019 interest with McArthurGlen in our two outlets in Naples and Venice. We continue to focus on our industry-leading balance sheet. We completed a number of secured financings during the quarter. We continue to lower our borrowing costs, increase our debt maturity, a term or current liquidity of $6.5 billion. And finally, on our dividend, in 2016 we will have paid $6.50, that\u2019s an increase of 7.4% compared to 6.05% that we paid last year, that\u2019s a lot. I\u2019m ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask on the leasing spread topic. I know you touched on it and it\u2019s been a popular point of conversation here. Since it\u2019s a trailing 12-month number, are the results we\u2019re seeing now in terms of lease spread just a pull forward and extension of something that happened to slow down in Q2 or did the third quarter slow too, realizing that it does include lease amendments? David Simon : Well, we have had, look, let\u2019s just put this number in perspective number one. We do include lease amendments and that\u2019s having the biggest impact of the growth slowing. Yet if you look at our average base rent, you can see we\u2019re doing new initial terms where we\u2019re doing very well. And some of the expiring leases also are a little bit expiring at a little bit higher level. Now, our investors know that over a long period of time, we\u2019ve always felt like the $5 to $6 spread was kind of always part of our model. The fact is we\u2019ve done a tremendous job of outperforming that. But the long-term we\u2019ve always kind of felt that $5 to $6 spread it\u2019s kind of where we think the market is. We had a couple of years of significant outperformance. But we\u2019re not backing off our inherent value that we have in our leases as they roll-over. And we\u2019re just getting back to kind of more of a normalized environment. But for us, I don\u2019t know about our peers but for us, we include lease amendments. And the bottom line is that it\u2019s having some impact on leasing spreads. But that $6 to $7 is maintaining itself and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve told investors year after year after year. And we feel very good about that. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then just also you mentioned that right now as you lease space, given the high occupancy, the remaining space might not be as well located. So I guess my question is since you have that high occupancy, what are kind of the thoughts behind making these, lease amendments and working with companies such as you pointed out PacSun? David Simon : Well, it\u2019s literally a case-by-case analysis. I think we\u2019re as sophisticated as anybody. I think when Aeropostale is a great example of our ability to analyze what the right trade is in these deals. And in some cases, we\u2019re going to take the space back, in other cases we\u2019re going to help the retailer go through the hard time. And it\u2019s really a case-by-case - it\u2019s a case-by-case analysis. But there is nobody I think in our industry that\u2019s more sophisticated in our ability to kind of maneuver through those situations. So, its case-by-case, anything can happen. Well, sometimes we work sometimes we get the space back. And certain in the Aero case, we thought the opportunity was even more exciting to just buy the retailer and make a vertical investment that the entire S&P community is doing. Amazon makes vertical investments the cable industry makes vertical investments. And again I would encourage, we decided to make vertical investments, when we decided to franchise Starbuck locations two or three years ago, that\u2019s the nature of our company is that we\u2019re going to be nimble, we have the right judgment win to make a deal with its retailer, when not, when to make a vertical investments, when not, when to go to Europe, when not; when to pull the plug on Copley, and when not. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the position we\u2019re already in today. And each and every case will be one-by-one. Now, I do appreciate and I hope I\u2019m right with you, Caitlin. I do appreciate you waiting to write until we have our call. And I do think that\u2019s important because the reason we have these calls is for not every - there is not every scenario where you can understand the nuances about what\u2019s going on in our business. So I do appreciate the patience, to hear our story. And then obviously you write whatever you want to write. Caitlin Burrows : Great, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning, David. David Simon : Good morning. Steve Sakwa : I guess is there a way for you to try and help separate out for us the impact of these amendments on the numbers? Meaning if PacSun and Aero were having as big an impact as they are, is there a way to sort of strip them out and give us a sense for kind of what the remaining lease spreads look like? Because obviously this is kind of the biggest number that people are focusing on, and if these two leases or tenants are having a disproportionate impact, it might help to separate out those figures for us. David Simon : Well, I don\u2019t, look, our business Steve, I hear you. If we need to, we might. But the fact is you got to look at our business in totality. You can\u2019t look at it on one operating metric or not. Because what I would ask you to look at is, let\u2019s talk about the - we have grown our portfolio NOI $300 million year-to-date. Let\u2019s talk about that. Do you want to talk about that? That to me is more material than any one operating statistic quarter-by-quarter. So, yes, we can slice and dice this any way but if we can spend more time talking about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI, there are many REITs that don\u2019t have $300 million of NOI yet we grew that in nine months. So, I would rather talk about that that\u2019s more material than the fluctuations that have, that are occurring with operating metrics. We could talk about sales - sales are impacted by the fact that we have great properties in tourist markets and the strong dollar. That doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s going to last forever. And but again, there is this high desire to make that the be-all of all these metrics. And again, our number is clean, the results we can\u2019t speak to anybody else how they do it. But I, as I said to you, if you want my opinion on what\u2019s important, it\u2019s the $300 million NOI growth. If you don\u2019t want that I got it. But that\u2019s what I focus on. Steve Sakwa : No, I get it and I don\u2019t think people are dismissing your ability to deploy capital, whether it\u2019s through developments or expansions. But clearly there has been more pressure on the mall business, so I just think anything that you can do to assuage the fears about the internal growth prospects going forward. And perhaps it\u2019s just that a $6 to $7 spread on a roughly $60 or $61 expiring rent means that normalized leasing spreads should be 10%. And maybe that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to head to. There\u2019s a new normal in the business. That\u2019s okay; I think people are just trying to get comfort with that. David Simon : Well, look, I think that\u2019s a good point, so let\u2019s talk about that. And I mentioned that a little bit in the first question. I think if you asked our investor group, we would have told them for 15 to 20 years that our re-leasing spreads are $5 or $6 a foot, okay. We have had a long period of outperformance on that. We\u2019ve gotten better at what we\u2019ve done all sorts of reasons that we don\u2019t have to bore you. And you are right we may be going back to kind of what we have promised our investor base for a long period of time. And the outperformance, I don\u2019t think from our standpoint we ever guaranteed outperformance from how we looked at re-leasing spreads. We always said look, it\u2019s $5 or $6, one year it might be $8, one year it might be $4 but that\u2019s kind of what we see the long-term trend. And I still feel comfortable but that\u2019s the basis. Now, it\u2019s no surprise that retail generally has come under pressure, lots of different reasons which we could go into but let\u2019s - unless you want to let\u2019s not. But the fact is, and we are impacted as I said to you before by our general GDP growth. And to date, our retail generally is there is no inflation and our nominal GDP growth is 1.5%, yet we\u2019re growing our comps timing. And if nominal GDP, there is some inflation. So maybe real GDP growth is I don\u2019t know 50 basis points. We\u2019re still growing our business with no inflation in our particular business at 3.5% comp NOI that\u2019s not that. It\u2019s not 4% plus that we did last year or the year before, but it\u2019s still in the scheme of being able to grow our business, that\u2019s not bad. And I\u2019m not defensive about it. I mean, that\u2019s kind of what I think we should expect when we have essentially a real GDP growth of 1%, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more. And I think that\u2019s what you got to put in perspective. Steve Sakwa : Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks for the time. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Thanks, Michael Bilerman here with Christy. How are you? David Simon : Good, thanks. Michael Bilerman : So, David, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about putting capital into your stock. Last year you had bought I think it was like $350 million at about 180. Obviously the stock, with some of the sell-off as well as some of the retail headlines, has come off 20%. We spent a lot of time talking about something you spent $30 million on. I was wondering you got a $2 billion share repurchase program, how you feel about putting money into your stock? David Simon : Well, look, I think at the end of the day the best thing we can do is invest in our product, okay because the stock will go up and it\u2019ll go down by investing in our product. And I think what unfortunately what I think a number of retailers, they\u2019ve not invested in their product, okay. Or they\u2019ve chased the holy-grail of internet sales to the determent of what they should be doing with the physical product, as still people want to go physical shopping. And when they go physical shopping, you\u2019ve got to have a nice physical environment. So we have spent a lot of years wanting to invest in our physical product. And I think that\u2019s our number one focus continues to be we\u2019re well through that. The good news is we have been contrary in that and we started that in \u201810. And as you know we\u2019re finishing projects, that\u2019s not just talking about projects but finishing a lot of projects. So, I think if that wind down then the opportunity to buy stock back is always there. And I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a high priority but that could change depending upon kind of where the world is and what the stock does. But I think my job is, the number one job I should be doing is, invest in making my product better. And that\u2019s my number one focus. Michael Bilerman : And you talked in your opening comments about your deal-making over the years and always taking a proper risk-reward and thinking about the capital committed to whether it\u2019s a project or whether it\u2019s a venture investment. As you think about investing in Aero, putting $30 million in, is there sort of a house limit that you would want to have in those sorts of investments relative to the whole? And where would it sit within the Simon organization? Is it more within the venture side or is there another sort of area? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the David Simon bucket. Where does it sit within the organization? David Simon : Well, look, even though I\u2019m older I can always learn new things. And I\u2019ve learned a lot actually going through the Aero-deal. We\u2019re going to act as an investor we\u2019re going to give strategic direction as a board member. Authentic brands, I\u2019d encourage you to look at the brands in the history of that company, they\u2019ve done a great job of, they are brand builders. They are entrepreneurs. So, we\u2019re not going to be running the business, we\u2019re going to help strategically like we did. It will be, but we\u2019re - so I\u2019ve got my IT guys helping with their IT Systems. We\u2019ve got our lawyers helping with their license agreements. So we have a lot we can bring to the table. And that\u2019s what makes us unique. And but it\u2019s not going to overwhelm anybody\u2019s particular time, they\u2019ve got a good management team that with our strategic help I think will continue to make that profitable. And look, based on the numbers, I think it\u2019s going to be a compelling investment. But it\u2019s not without risk. I mean, it is, there is risk out there whenever you make a venture like investment but I can\u2019t think of a better team between Gordon Brothers, Hilco, ABG, General Growth to all put a collective judgment to bear to make this a profitable investment. I don\u2019t think going back to your first question I don\u2019t think this is going to be the wave of the future. I mean, AT&T, I mentioned vertical because I just try to put certain things outside of real-estate in perspective, okay. So, AT&T was buying, going vertical. They\u2019re spending a $100 billion, okay. I go vertical, I spend $33 million, okay, million not billion, $33 million. And again I\u2019m not comparing, I\u2019ll just try to put these things in perspective, I\u2019m not comparing our business to AT&T or anybody else. Amazon, what\u2019s made Amazon great is they\u2019ve had the latitude to go vertical. They\u2019ve gone vertical, they\u2019ve gone content, they\u2019ve gone distribution, they\u2019ve gone retail, and that may be the future of corporate America is that you\u2019re not going to pigeon-hole these comps. If we want to just talk about leasing a Sears-box that we get back, I mean, that\u2019s okay for some companies but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. So, again, there is no, we have no bucket, it\u2019s not going to take away from what we\u2019re doing, my number one priority is to make our product better any way that we can, technology digital investments look and feel, better retailers, different mix, redevelopment, however that transpires. And making a vertical investment here or there, not going to overwhelm us. But I want the latitude to, and I think the investment community should want us to. By the end of the day, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we\u2019re buying a business that ought to be valued at six times EBITDA and we\u2019re buying at a 1 to 2. And I think that\u2019s a pretty good trend. But we\u2019re not there yet and that\u2019s the goal, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. Christy McElroy : Hi David, it\u2019s Christy, sorry about the three questions. Just bigger picture, the consortium has talked about 300 to 400 store-based count for Aeropostale, there has been a lot of talk about store-count rationalization among national retailers generally in how many stores do they actually need to serve their customers in their market today. Why is that the right number of stores for a retailer like Aeropostale? And what does that imply for your view of the need for other retailers to close stores, especially now that you\u2019re looking at this issue through that Aeropostale lens? David Simon : Well, look, and it\u2019s very - I think you\u2019ve pointed out something is very unique, is that we\u2019re getting a lens at a much granular level on retail. So it\u2019s very interesting. Sourcing, look, there are five or six things that really make a retailer click, sourcing, obviously rent expense, store expense, the merchandize all of it, packaging, all the stuff that I think at the end of the day we\u2019re going to make us better real-estate owners. But that remains to be seen. Aero, look, I\u2019m probably going to get in trouble for this but since I like you, I\u2019m going to tell you. Right now, we\u2019re looking at around 500 stores in the U.S., as kind of a model. And based upon we expect every one of those stores to be profitable. So, it\u2019s a much bigger business than we initially went in, in the investment. We were thinking we could justify our investment at a much lower store-base the fact of the matter is we found out there is a lot more store profitability out there than we thought. So, it\u2019s going to be around 500 give or take. But I think store closings, it is - the pressure for that retailers\u2019 to invest in the internet to close stores from their investment community is great. I would question whether that\u2019s the right strategy because some of these stores are very profitable. Yet, they feel like the headline closing stores, is the answer and then all of this investment into the internet is going to pay all these dividends. The fact of the matter is there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think all of us can\u2019t lose sight of that. And that\u2019s where we should be investing. So, I do think there will be more pressure on store closings. Unfortunately over our history, we\u2019re pro to that I don\u2019t need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we went public with in \u201893 no longer exist in 2016. And we will be able to deal with it, it\u2019s much easier to deal with it when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all the retail platforms that we have. But it\u2019s the soup of the day. And so, I don\u2019t think it needs to be 300 or 400 or 500, I think there are lots of profitable stores that retailers are feeling the pressure they\u2019ve got to do something. And I would like them to invest in their stores it\u2019s something I would like them to do. But I don\u2019t always win that argument. So, we\u2019re equipped to handle that, that\u2019s what we do. And but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now what we did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. Firstly it is up, so put that in perspective. We also said our bankruptcy store closings would be down in \u201816, it is down. We had much greater in \u201815, and we\u2019ve basically more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in \u201815 in a flat-to-tough retail environment. And I think everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay. So, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re doing cartwheels here. It is, we\u2019re grinding, word is good as it gets when it comes to grinding. And that\u2019s the environment that is presented to us. And we\u2019ll have to deal with it. Christy McElroy : Thanks so much for the color. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Your line is open. Jeff Spector : Great, thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m also here with Craig Schmidt. I guess, David, if we could just talk a little bit more about the current environment. Let\u2019s say it continues; it persists through \u201817, even \u201818. How should we think about these rent amendments? How are you thinking about it when you\u2019re laying out your budget for next year? Is this just something that we should get used to as we transition here as the retailers invest more money in their stores, we see more store closings? How should we think about that? David Simon : Well, look, I think again, it\u2019s a retail-by-retail perspective. We\u2019re seeing stabilization in our sales business, if you want to go focus on retail sales Q2-over-Q3 is basically flat. And if you take out tourism, you take out one retailer that\u2019s had decreases in sales, that\u2019s actually up. So, we\u2019re not like - there is no huge concern here. But we just, we\u2019re a product of the overall U.S. economy. Jeff, what\u2019s the real GDP growth, you tell me. So, in that environment what do you think it is the real one? Real GDP growth, what would, Merrill\u2019s got a bunch of smart people, what would they say of this? Jeff Spector : I think we\u2019re saying around that 1%, 1.5%. David Simon : So, I mean, we\u2019re good, I\u2019m not that good but I got a lot of people around me that are good. That\u2019s a constraint. So but it is what it is. We\u2019ll sort it through and I do think in that kind of environment, we\u2019re going to have certain deals where we will go back and then we\u2019re going to have a lot of other deals, frankly, we\u2019re going to take the space back. And my moods changing a little bit that maybe we\u2019re better off taking the space back. I think we did play ball a little bit more with the bankruptcies in \u201815 and the early \u201816. And that\u2019s showing up in the lease spreads. And I\u2019m thinking sales are okay, stabilizing, maybe the world gets over all of this stuff that\u2019s going on out there maybe we stabilize. A lot of people feel like we\u2019re headed for growth. So maybe we take more space back. But we\u2019ve kept the buildings full, as evidenced by the occupancy, there is a trade-off. We\u2019re on our target for top-of-the-line increase. So, it\u2019s not all that bad. So, just put in perspective, \u201817 will transpire and will do a combination, sometimes will play ball, other times we\u2019re going to take the space back. And it\u2019s all a function of retail-by-retail decisions, space-by-space, retailer-by-retailer. Jeff Spector : Okay, thanks. And I think Craig has one question. Craig Schmidt : Great, thanks. Maybe I could do a little bit of a pivot here. Looking at your new developments for the outlets, four of the five projects are international. Can we expect to see continued good growth in new projects on international scale? And then maybe more specifically with your longer-term plans are with McArthurGlen? David Simon : Well, we just had a meeting with - I had a meeting with our partner last Friday. Their business is very good, very solid. Provence is opening in spring of next year which will be fantastic. We\u2019re very close on getting the potential to build Normandie, which we think will be a great, which will basically cover the Western Parisian market. That could be fantastic. We\u2019ve got a couple of acquisitions that we\u2019re working on, extensions that we\u2019re working on. So it\u2019s all good there, it\u2019s been, the team are working well together. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the investment. And I think it\u2019s Craig it\u2019s just kind of business as usual. We\u2019re still seeing new development growth, very pleased just that we\u2019ve been able to create that partnership and create that relationship going forward. In Asia, the team is working in a couple of other markets that I\u2019m hopeful over time that we\u2019ll be able to build the premium outlet product there. We\u2019ve got couple of big expansions in the works Gotemba is an example that could be a landmark extension. So that business is, we\u2019re not slowing by any stretch of imagination internationally in our outlet business either with McArthurGlen or with our Asian partners. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning, David. David Simon : How are you doing? Alexander Goldfarb : Just fabulous; it\u2019s earnings season, life is great. So, just a few questions here, let me start with an easier one before I ask one on the favorite same-store topic. Here in New York, obviously, a lot of - sorry, the demand for street retail has gone down a lot, so a lot of vacant spaces; articles about global brands rethinking their street retail needs, especially with where rents are and store profitability. Have you seen as those brands have dialed back, have you seen them, I don\u2019t want to say shift back, but have you seen more interest in going in malls where they are profitable? Or from your perspective, they\u2019ve always been running street retail, their investment there, separate from their decision to open up in malls? David Simon : I don\u2019t think there is a generic answer to that, I think its brand-by-brand. And generally on the luxury side of those brands, their business is actually, they\u2019re starting to anniversary some of the strong dollar stuff. And obviously we are as well. And I meet with a lot of the folks, I mean, there are certainly some brands here and there that are pulling back but I\u2019d say generally and you\u2019re starting to see the numbers like from LVMH and Kering that have posted recently. Their business is good, pretty good. I think New York is - this is a novice because we have no street retail. But New York is a little confusing to them because you got 5th, you\u2019ve got Madison, you\u2019ve got Downtown, you\u2019ve got different - you\u2019ve got new developments, you got West 57th Street, so they\u2019re all trying to sort that out. I think in our business, it hasn\u2019t changed. And if anything I\u2019d say the mood is generally better than it was six months ago, if you want a generic statement. And I think New York City itself is just different because they\u2019re all trying to figure out where they need to be given what\u2019s going on in New York. But we don\u2019t have a dog in that hunt. And I think Brickell is going to be I mean, we have a little delay with the hurricane and I guess it really, technically wasn\u2019t a hurricane or not, I\u2019m not really sure. But Brickell I think is going to be lot of the retailers rope-in in the first quarter of next year. But I think that mix there is really going to be great, cool. I think the stack-store is going to be great. And the demand on that just continued to pick up, right Rick, over, month after month. And I think that\u2019s a good indication that if you have a good product or you have a good scheme, retailers are coming. Rick, you want to comment on Brickell? Rick Sokolov : I think Brickell is certainly going to show that there is going to be a great mix of designers, food, international retailers and right now we\u2019re 91% leased. And as David said, the opening is going to take place over. We\u2019re going to have a big slug over the next few weeks and another big slug over the first quarter of next year. The only other thing I would say to you is that we are seeing the international retailers like Zara, like H&M accelerating their focus on our properties in the United States because there is demand to grow in this market. And we are seeing that. David Simon : And I would just say, we\u2019ve got just to finish the whole thought and then you can ask me, if it\u2019s on comp NOI, it\u2019s not a tough question, it\u2019s going to tell you exactly what I\u2019m thinking. Alexander Goldfarb : You don\u2019t know the question yet, David. David Simon : All right, all right, bring it on. Alexander Goldfarb : We don\u2019t give our questions in advance. David Simon : All right, okay, good. Thank you. That\u2019s what I like about you Alex. So, but just to finish the luxury, people that would populate street retail in New York, we say luxury, not that it\u2019s easy but we\u2019re making progress with Clearfork and that\u2019s in Fort Worth, Texas. We\u2019re going to have those kinds of brands, not a lot of them but the right ones. We opened King of Prussia with the connection and again, a lot of those are opening. But the results from those high-end brands have been fantastic. So, that part of our business is different, I think it\u2019s interesting it\u2019s actually starting to do better than maybe what you\u2019re seeing and whatever is being talked about in New York street retail. But I really, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really have a dog in that hunt. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Then the second question is it sounded like you said that bankruptcies and the issues really peaked last year and that you guys were more accommodative with retailers trying to restructure. And, therefore, it seems like this year we\u2019re seeing the impact in the same-store metrics. At the same time, I think you said that the tourism impact strong dollar is also anniversarying. So it almost sounds like next year we should expect same-store metrics to get a positive bump as these trends sort of anniversary. Is that fair? Or as you guys look into your leasing for next year, we still should see some of this impact, whether it\u2019s on re-leasing spreads or same-store NOI etcetera? Should we still see that in \u201817 or is \u201817 going to be a little better because this stuff anniversaries? David Simon : Look, I think the big unknown is just what\u2019s going on, all you have to do and you\u2019re smart financial guy, look at our P&L right. You could see, put the leasing spreads aside, put all those other stuff aside, I mean, the reality is, the comp NOI is really a function of our overage rent which is right there on the financial statement, okay, it\u2019s down. Can\u2019t help it, I mean, and it\u2019s really a function of the fact that we got these great tourist centers we\u2019re having, we\u2019re suffering from that impact. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long-term impact. But it\u2019s starting to anniversary and it shouldn\u2019t continue to get worse, okay. But Alex, it could get worse because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen with the dollar. The international tourist market is volatile. At best, we live in an uncertain time. But I think we\u2019re doing, to deliver this 3.5% and deliver over 6% portfolio growth is I think is reasonably good, it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s reasonably good given some of the constraints that we\u2019re dealing with that are a little bit out of our control, a little bit. We\u2019re going to take responsibility for a lot of that stuff, but a little bit out of control. So, I think it\u2019s too early to tell you on \u201817. Unfortunately I say this because it starts not next week, the week after, Rick, property budgets? Rick Sokolov : Yes, week after. David Simon : Week after where we go one-by-one, space-by-space and we\u2019ll report back early next year what our view of that is. And it\u2019s a little, there is a little more volatility in being able, the standard deviations probably little bit higher than it used to be just because of the environment that we have that we\u2019re operating in. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And just confirming you\u2019re taking an, $0.08-charge, that\u2019s in guidance for Copley? David Simon : I\u2019m glad you asked that. And the answer is yes. That is in guidance. So if we had not taken that charge, our guidance would be up another $0.08. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thanks, David. David Simon : No worries. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is open. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. Just to follow-on on that, so that would be $0.13. I mean is there anything you could point to as a driver of that kind of guidance increase in late October? David Simon : Well, generally we\u2019re producing the results we want to produce. So I know the operating metrics on that, perfect, we\u2019re not going to deny that. I mean, but we told at the beginning of the year, this is the plan, 3.5%, 6%, and we\u2019re producing a little bit better on that front overall. And that\u2019s where it rolls up to. And so, we\u2019re being very cautious on Copley, we have made the final decision on that. But I think it\u2019s likely that we\u2019re going to do that. But we\u2019ve got, I\u2019ve got to run it through the board and - but I want the market to know that that maybe off the table going forward at least for the time being. And we could - look we could have kept it on our books and waited but you know what, I think the right thing to do if we in fact decide to do it will be to pick that hit. Paul Morgan : Okay. And then you mentioned in terms of the same-store number not just PacSun, but then also I think you said intentionally kind of reducing the specialty leasing program in the common area at some of your high-end malls. Is that a material impact? And kind of what\u2019s sort of the thought process behind that? And kind of maybe - if you have a number, you\u2019ve given us in the past kind of what that program is as a percent of NOI? David Simon : Well, I think it\u2019s material and that it does affect the comp number. The comps would be higher had we not chosen. But look, part of what we have to do is, listen to our clients. Our clients to some degree especially in certain areas of the mall very concerned about that. So, we want to be receptive, we\u2019ve got competition in some of these markets that we\u2019ve got to be responsive to. And we just think it\u2019s the right thing to do. We did a lot of research on the consumer. Consumer really doesn\u2019t care but on the other hand, we have two - when it comes to the property business, we\u2019ve got to listen to our clients i.e. the retailers, etcetera. And we obviously have to be listened to the consumers, they diverge here but in this case we want to be as sensitive to the clients as we can. And some are very sensitive to us and we don\u2019t want to keep that from bringing the right mix into some of these centers. And that has hurt us over the years. We\u2019ve thinned out in the very high-end properties. Yes, go ahead. Paul Morgan : I was just going to say, has this strategy been kind of accelerating recently is why you mentioned it in terms of the same-store number this quarter or has it kind of been ongoing over the past period of time? David Simon : I think it\u2019s been, look, we didn\u2019t really do it last year because a lot of these projects were in the state of development. But it\u2019s clearly been - it\u2019s clearly been throughout \u201817. Paul Morgan : Okay. David Simon : And remember, this stuff builds, it has more of a... Rick Sokolov : As you go later in the year it has more of a back-end impact, okay. So it kind of builds, it\u2019s less important in Q1 and Q2 just because seasonality of our business. Paul Morgan : Great. Then just last question; I appreciate all the color on the Aero-economics. And just wanted to ask, there\u2019ve been dozens of similar bankruptcies over the years and you probably could\u2019ve had opportunities to do something similar then. Maybe could you point to anything outside just the economics of it that makes you think differently about this? And then just going forward, I know you had the macro view about vertical integration, but anything more, kind of your narrow business driven where you didn\u2019t do this for years and now it looks interesting? David Simon : Well, I think that\u2019s a very good question. And I would say this, I think as we\u2019ve gotten to know authentic brand group we now have, for us to have done this without their involvement on how to stabilize and then grow the brand, I mean, that would, I might have that expertise a couple of years from now, maybe, I mean, I\u2019d say, we, I doubt it, but maybe, you never know. And I think having and we have talked, it\u2019s very interesting. I\u2019ve been talking to authentic brands over - for a year about another, brands that might fit into this model that we are creating. But they didn\u2019t come to fruition for whatever reason. But I think we finally, we have, over this last year been able to develop kind of an operating model and platform. They\u2019re great at brand building, having general growth as part of that. And their ability to bring their real-estate and their thoughtfulness to the table in terms of how you operate the business was very helpful. So having the liquidation angle solved with Hilco and Gordon Brothers was critical. So it was really the long - in a nutshell it was really, because the partners were able to do it. The partners brought so much to the table that this was the right deal. If it were just us on our own, I\u2019d be the first to tell you I don\u2019t know that we would do it, we\u2019ve done Starbuck franchises but that\u2019s we did by the way. And I encourage everybody that goes Del Amo, goes to Pink\u2019s Hotdogs, that\u2019s owned by your company, Simon Property Group. I\u2019m so, excited about that franchise as we own. It\u2019s great hotdogs. It\u2019s an institution. That\u2019s - we\u2019ve got a small group that kind of runs that business, this is a little bit out of the ordinary. And I would say simply put, the fact that we had this partnership that was able to navigate all of the complexities of this. And so, I think that\u2019s the important determinant of why we did this versus not doing others. Paul Morgan : And the partners see it as not necessarily just a one-off, but something that could be replicated? David Simon : Yes, but we\u2019ve got to walk, crawl before we run. Paul Morgan : Great, thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Rich Hill : Hi guys. Thanks for the time this morning; and I always appreciate the transparency. I wanted to just ask a quick question about the lease amendments, maybe in the context of your broader portfolio of malls. You have obviously the luxury of seeing across the productivity spectrum. So when we\u2019re thinking about lease amendments in maybe your higher-quality malls, is it may be the case that some of these tenants are paying above-market rents to get into the best-quality malls and, therefore, you might still be incentivized to make a lease amendment? Maybe reduce their rent, but recognizing it\u2019s still a pretty attractive rent overall? Is that the right way to think about it? Then maybe if you could provide some color, if any, about how you\u2019re seeing lease amendments on malls doing $700 a square-foot versus maybe those doing $350. But I do appreciate that it\u2019s mall-to-mall. David Simon : Well, I mean, that\u2019s the bottom line. Certainly we have some of those cases. But it really is mall-by-mall, space-by-space. And what the retailer relationship is and what we think the retailer future is. I wish there were simple straightforward answer but there is not. We try to use our business judgment in figuring out what the right is. It\u2019s also we want to be conservative or do we want to be aggressive what\u2019s our mood of the future. As you know last year, we had a lot of bankruptcies. And we gave direction to like okay, we\u2019re starting to change our attitude a little bit, I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s going to be a complete reversal. And we try the right we make the right judgment call. Now I will tell you lease amendments are like anything else. Once you do it for one retailer, don\u2019t kid yourself, you hear about it, and it goes everywhere else. Part of our job is to contain that. And but we\u2019ve experienced this before, we did do is in other economic times. And again, our business is fine but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s - we\u2019re trying to be accommodating but we could shift our strategy pretty quickly. And we try to evaluate it one-by-one. Rick, do you want to add anything to it? Rick Sokolov : I would say to you the most important consideration to realize this - these are lease amendments that are not forever. One of our considerations is do we have a better replacement tenant but that tenant won\u2019t be ready to open for a year or where it is in the project and what is the project. So all of those factors come into play as to how we want to deal with this specific room and how we price the room and how we interface with that tenant. And the only other point I would make is that, and it gets lost some times. But today our portfolio has never been stronger, never been better physical condition, never had a better mix of small-shot tenants, better mix of boxes, better mix of restaurants better set of amenities. So, we are on a continual basis taking share and that\u2019s our focus to make our properties as compelling as they can be. And that helps us in dealing with all the things you\u2019ve been talking about. David Simon : And again, the business we are 96.3% occupied. And as an example, Macy\u2019s announced 100 store closing. Their closing, Macy\u2019s is leaving one of our malls, they\u2019re leaving one of our malls, we think. And a very small mall that has basically no financial impact to us at the end of the day. So, there is this narrative and the mood. But the fact of the matter is, go back to 7.3% NOI growth that\u2019s $300 million. Let\u2019s put it all in perspective, okay. Rich Hill : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum : Great, thanks. Could you give a brief update on what\u2019s happening with your Seritage JV? Rick Sokolov : We are basically in the same position that we articulated in our last earnings call. We have identified users for our boxes. We have plans for our boxes. We are not going to proceed with that redevelopment. And so we have a firm understanding of our returns and the costs of downsize from the Sear stores. There are conversations going on right now regarding those costs. And as soon as we have a clear understanding of that we\u2019re in a position to proceed to try next year on some of those redevelopments. Floris van Dijkum : And that would include the Primark at Burlington Mall? Rick Sokolov : That is independent. That is proceeding as is the addition of Primark at South Shore in a portion Sears which is not in Seritage. The Primark lease at Burlington was, existing at the time we did our joint venture. And that is proceeding. Floris van Dijkum : Great. Thanks, Rick. David, a question for you in terms of how sustainable do you - I mean, you\u2019re talking about the 6.6% to 7% NOI growth, but if you put that in perspective, you do that for a decade you\u2019ve doubled NOI. I mean is that realistic for a $100 billion company? David Simon : We\u2019re working to achieve that, okay. I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not that clairvoyant to look out that far. Floris van Dijkum : But do you see anything near term that\u2019s going to break that streak? David Simon : Well, I think we\u2019re going to lead our industry and portfolio NOI growth as we\u2019ve done it for so long, I don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t continue. Floris van Dijkum : Great. Thanks, guys. David Simon : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Hi, I guess going back to Aero for a second; you discussed this as being more of an opportunistic investment. But out of curiosity, when you first thought about it and got into it was it more a defensive play to control store closings? How did you look at it initially? David Simon : Not at all, as I said in my opening comments, I mean, no one would put new money into a business that we didn\u2019t think would have exciting future. And that\u2019s evidenced by kind of the group that we have bought the companies. So we certainly get the benefit of Aero paying rent. But that\u2019s not a reason to invest in a business. We could re-lease those spaces. And that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not a factor in putting new money into investment. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. On the outlet side, you talked about international expansion. Can you just talk about the U.S. and what the opportunities are that you see over the next 5 years, 10 years, just what does that pipeline look like? David Simon : In our outlet business? Michael Mueller : Yes, outlets. David Simon : I think, the pace may not be as hectic as we\u2019ve done over the last three or four years. But Norfolk we open next year, we\u2019re going to actually start another outlet in the spring of this year, spring \u201817 in a very good growing market. We\u2019ve got another one under serious examination. So I don\u2019t think it will be as maybe as active as we\u2019ve had over the last two or three years, but we\u2019ll selectively do some stuff one, at least one a year on average, maybe two. We\u2019ve got some I think some unique opportunities. We\u2019re also very focused on expanding with the Allen deal. Adding 120,000-square-foot to a center that does, I don\u2019t know $600 plus a foot, and the outlet business is very attractive. So there is a lot to do with domestic portfolio as well. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay, that was it. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. So David, I just wanted to go back to something you just said just a minute ago. As you deal with retailers like Aeropostale and PacSun and go through your lease negotiations, how do you really contain the risk that somehow leverage doesn\u2019t move more towards retailers that might be in trouble, that might come back to you and try to do similar deals going forward? David Simon : Well, as I said when this happens, you get, you do get a - it does tend to spread. On the other hand it\u2019s very simple, so we\u2019re not going to do it. So that changes the dynamics pretty quickly. So, look, again, we don\u2019t, this is a space-by-space, retail-by-retailer decision. It\u2019s not pervasive throughout. But this and again I explained to you our rationale as to why we kind of did it \u201815, \u201816. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll reevaluate every day with every retailer. And my instinct is that we could be changing how we dealt with kind of the \u201815,\u201916 stuff already. But it will be a case-by-case basis. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just going back to your development pipeline, you have about $3.5 billion worth of projects. Just given that some of those projects or a lot of them were probably started at time where maybe the view of the health of the retail environment might be a little bit different, how should we think about the overall arc of capital deployment? Is it reasonable to expect that number to come down going forward? David Simon : Look, there is nothing in our redevelopment that we\u2019re not doing other than potentially Copley. And Copley was I mean I would encourage everybody to study what\u2019s going in construction cost and what\u2019s going on in supply and demand there. We did not want to be, unfortunately the build there is longer than it should be because of the nature of how we have to reinforce the structure. And we spent a lot on it because to get approvals and to make sure we had the engineering to do it. But the reality is, when we started seeing the construction cost, it just not the right time to do it with all the supply and the cost there. We don\u2019t see that anywhere else in the portfolio. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of very interesting stuff to do beyond what we\u2019re doing now. And like I said we\u2019ve done some really good work in the field and King of Prussia, being part of Brickell, Clearfork, we\u2019ve got plans to expand Fashion Valley and I could go through the whole list. But that part of the business is unabated because we think investing in our great real-estate is what we should do for a living and that\u2019s not changing. But we do have to worry about supply and demand. And I\u2019m not worried about supply and demand in our retail portfolio. In the case of Copley I got nervous about it. Be the first to admit. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. This ends the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks. David Simon : All right, thank you for your questions. And we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a very good year. We completed and opened several new developments and redevelopments. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, further increasing our liquidity, extending our average term, and reducing our average weighted \u2013 average interest cost, and we continued to achieve strong financial results. Our full year 2016 FFO per diluted share was $10.49, which includes a $0.38 charge for the early redemption of our 10.35% notes. On a comparable basis, full-year FFO per share was $10.87, and increased 9% year-over-year. We once again delivered compelling FFO growth and we have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 11% over the last three years and 13% over the last five years. The $10.87 exceeded our initial guidance range of $10.70 to $10.80, even after the impact to our FFO of the $0.08 charge we recorded in the fourth quarter due to our decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower. We are excellent project managers and had obtained 14 out of the 15 required approvals needed to proceed with the tower and expected to get the last one, but unfortunately, the goalpost kept moving. The change in the project approval dynamics and the uncertainty of receiving the last approval, combined with the rapidly rising construction cost and our heightened concern about supply in the Boston residential market, prompted us to postpone the project and take the charge. While write-offs of development costs can occur in the real estate business, it is rare for us to experience a charge of this size and we're not pleased about it. For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.53 per share includes the $0.38 per share loss on the extinguishment of debt. On a comparable basis, excluding the debt charge, but including the $0.08 charge of the Copley Residential write-off, FFO per diluted share increased 6.6% year-over-year and comparable FFO per share growth would have been 9.5% without the Copley charge. Moving on from our results, now could be the time on the call where I could go into a lengthy philosophical discussion on the popular misconceptions about the mall business, created by the never-ending current public narrative. And I could counter that by pointing that we have 434 department stores in our portfolio, and only one is vacant, and how in the recently announced department store closing, we have only one closure in our portfolio, or how we have added more than 275 sit-down or quick-service restaurants, more than 20 entertainment concepts, and more than 80 big box tenants across our portfolio over the last four, five years, or how we've added mixed use components to our centers in the last several years, we have built 10 hotels and residents representing nearly 3,000 units, or how according to a recent survey a Generation Z members, a group that outsizes Millennials, 70% of those surveyed visit the mall at least once a month and visit more than four stores during the visit, or how the consumers still like to shop in stores, because they want to touch and feel the products before they make a final decision, or how online retail sales have grown to less than 10% of total retail sales, and that the retailers who occupy our centers represent approximately two-thirds of those total online sales, or how leading e-commerce retailers, like Warby Parker, Blue Nile, UNTUCKit, Shinola, among others, are opening physical stores, because the inherent advantage a physical location provides as well as being a natural extension to the digital world, or how basket sizes are higher, return rates are lower in stores compared to online purchases, and margins are much higher in the store than they are in the Internet, or how emerging brands like GUIDEBOAT, NIC+ZOE, Peloton, to name a few, continue to see the mall as the launch pad to build their brand awareness, as a result of the significant traffic they experience being at the mall, much like Apple or Microsoft did several years ago, or how we are making all these changes and enhancements to our center, even though Congress has tilted the scale towards e-commerce by not implementing the Marketplace Fairness Act, which not requiring the sales and use tax to be paid by consumers who buy products online, even though they are required to do so under existing laws. But I could do that, but I won't, because we've talked about that all before, so I'd rather focus on what we do and how we do it, and that is we reinvest in our properties, making them the best centers in the respective markets. We grow our earnings, we generate excess cash flow, we pay higher dividends, and we achieve all of this while maintaining the industry's strongest balance sheet. That's our model and that's what we do for the benefit of our shareholders, our communities, and our retailers. We continue to record solid key operating metrics and grow our cash flow. Over the last six years, we have doubled our dividend from $3.50 in 2011 to an expected payout of at least $7 this year and increased our annual cash flow after distribution by more than 20% from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion even after having taken into the account the loss of cash flow from the spin-off of WPG. We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio. Our malls and premium outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.8%, 70 basis points higher than year-end 2005 and near historic high levels. Leasing activity remains solid, the malls and premium outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.82 per square foot, an increase of 12.7%. In our supplement this morning, we have provided new information regarding our leasing spreads. Our new disclosure is based upon an open and closed methodology, excluding less than one year terms and captures a higher percentage of our leasing activities than our previous calculation with over 8 million square feet of annual leasing activity included. Our base minimum rent was up to $51.59, which was up 5.4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations. Total portfolio NOI increased 6.7% or more than $380 million for the year. Comp NOI increased 3.8% for the quarter and 3.6% for the year. Comp NOI growth was impacted by more than $30 million decline in overage rent for the year due to the lower sales volume at our tourist-oriented centers. This lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI growth by approximately 60 basis points for the year and to put this all in perspective, which we think is important. Over the last five years, our comp NOI has increased an average of 4.4% per year and our annual comp NOI has increased by $1.2 billion since 2012. Now let's talk about reported retailer sales at our malls and outlets, were $614 per foot compared to $620 per foot in 2015. Sales per square foot for our combined malls and outlets increased in each successive months during the fourth quarter, reflecting consumers' strong interest in holiday shopping at our centers. Reported retailer sales continued to be impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Excluding the impact on those centers, sales per square foot was flat for the year. We are the industry leader in gift card offerings and productivity. In 2016, we achieved record gift card sales with a 14% year-over-year comp growth. Consumer interest in our gift card program is a really good indicator of traffic to our centers. And these sales support our view that traffic was up in our centers for 2016. Quickly on redevelopment, at the end of the fourth quarter redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all three platforms, with our share of the net cost at approximately $1.1 billion. We completed a number of strategic developments in the fourth quarter and we'll complete a number of transformations throughout 2017, including The Galleria and La Plaza Mall, College Mall and a new development we opened two new projects in the fourth quarter, which promise to be great additions to our portfolio. First of all, Clarksburg Premium Outlets had the strongest open of any premium outlet in a long time, shoppers swarmed the D.C. area's new premier home for outlet shopping and Brickell City Centre in Miami opened in the fourth quarter. We believe it's a landmark mixed-use development offering unparalleled shopping, dining and entertainment experience. Construction continues on another full price development in Fort Worth at Shops at Clearfork, which is anchored by Neiman. We also have five new outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia; four in the international markets, France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada, all scheduled to open this year. At the end of the fourth quarter, our share of investment at these six new development projects was $506 million. Now let's talk about our fortress balance sheet, which continues to differentiate us compared to our peer group. 2016 was the first year that our annual fixed charge coverage was over 5 times. We completed three senior note offerings during the year totaling $3.8 billion, with an average weighted coupon rate of 2.86% and weighted average term of 11.4 years. The $3.8 billion is a record amount of notes we have ever issued in a single year. We also retired five series of senior notes comprising $1.9 billion at a weighted average coupon of 6.5%. We completed 27 mortgage loans with a weighted average interest of 3.67% and 9.4 years respectively. Our share of these mortgages was $3 billion, another record amount in a single year for us and contrary to media reports about the inability or ability to finance malls. Our current liquidity stands at $7 billion. We also repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $255 million in the fourth quarter. Dividend, we have paid a record dividend in 2016 of $6.50 per share and have achieved the compound annual growth rate of 12% over the last three years. Today we announced a dividend of $1.75 per share for this quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9.4%. As I mentioned previously, we expect to pay at least $7 per share in 2017, which will be an increase of 7.7% compared to 2016. Finally, guidance, our 2017 guidance range is $11.45 to $11.55. This range represents approximately 9% to 10% growth compared to our reported FFO per share of $10.49 in 2016 or 5.3% to 6.3% compared to our comparable FFO per share of $10.87, which, without question, will be the high end of our peer group. Once again, our range is based on the following assumptions, comparable NOI growth for our combined mall, premium outlet and mills platform of (16:31) 3%, no plans or disposition activity, a rising interest rate environment, the impact from a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to 2016 levels, including the translation impact of our international operations and the impact on domestic spending by international tourist and a diluted share count of approximately 361 million shares. And we're now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. I was wondering, your redevelopments, you have previously said, you think you can spend $1 billion through 2018? Does it look like if you go past that 2018 and still continue to spend that $1 billion a year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Craig, I think the answer is most likely. Obviously, we do expect to redevelop a lot of the Seritage joint venture projects over time. And there may be other department stores. But I think, we feel reasonably good about that kind of number but we're going to also \u2013 look, I think, the most important thing that we've done for ourselves and probably I could say for the industry is we've invested in our product. We are in the physical real estate business. And by having a good product, well tenanted that looks and feels good, we think drives traffic and we think helps our retailers and our consumers. So we'll continue to invest in our projects because we know it does pay dividends literally and figuratively. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then you touched on the international shopper, I mean, is that shopper plateauing \u2013 not plateauing but leveling out, stabilizing? And should we think of 2017 increase in percentage rent relative to the amount collected in 2016? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we're being relatively conservative. I mean it's impossible to project what's going to happen with tourism and the dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the yen or the euro or the real in terms of \u2013 down in South America, so we're taking our best estimate. Obviously, we've experienced a lot of volatility in that area. These are great assets that we want to own for the long run. But we are suffering a little bit of extra volatility. I think we did see a plateau in the fourth quarter, Craig, on that as evidenced by our sales increase in each and every month. It was below the 2015 levels, primarily because of that tourism spend, but it is starting to get a little bit better. I think you've seen a number of the luxury players announcing better results, but it's just a volatile world, volatile market and we do our very best at projecting what we think it is. And that's our number and we're kind of more cautious than anything at this point. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question is from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Just on the lease spreads, you changed the reporting and I get your reason in terms of it being a bigger chunk of the activity. I mean, it still kind of shows a drop year-over-year. And I'm wondering, I mean, if you were to have reported it on a kind of the same basis, would it kind of have been comparable to the 10.9% you had last quarter and how should we think about next year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I figured it would \u2013 you would ask that and it would be a 11.7%. But let me take a step back, because I think this is really \u2013 so Paul, it would be a 11.7% spread, okay. That's the question to your first \u2013 that's the answer to your first question. But let me take a \u2013 let me explain to you how we think about our business. We run our business for cash flow growth, NOI growth. Okay. And the metrics spit out but we don't manage our business for metrics. So, when the market reacted to our leasing spreads, we said, well, we kind of have a feel for them, but that's not how we run the business, we run the business for cash flow growth. Obviously, that's been a pretty good strategy because we've grown our comp NOI by $1.2 billion over the last four years, five years, guys. So, that strategy that I've had about growing our cash flow and focusing on comp NOI has been pretty damn good because $1.2 billion is bigger than most REITs. I don't even know how many REITs have $1.2 billion of NOI. So, put that aside. So, we were looking \u2013 boy, the market react to these spreads, what is it? So we did some research. And I'll give you a small example. So, we have a \u2013 because it's same space to same space is how we historically calculated our spreads. So, we're picking up, as an example, a \u2013 taking back a Forever 21 box in St. Johns mall, okay, which was, I don't know, 15,000 square feet thereabouts. We split it up into three rooms, Tesla, Apple, what was the third? Unknown Speaker : Tory Burch. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Tory Burch. We had huge rent spreads, but because it wasn't same space to same space, for whatever strange reason, it wasn't in our numbers, okay. So we said, look, one of the goals that we're going to do to run our comp NOI is try to downsize as many of the retailers to increase their productivity and to put in as many tenants as we can and in these great malls because we'll get \u2013 we'll actually get more productivity, which could lead to higher rents. But because it wasn't same space to same space, it wasn't in our numbers. So we said, well, timeout. We've got to do this on a basis that gives you a better perspective of our strategy. Again, we are not overwhelmed about lease spreads, and it's all about getting the best retailer in the best space at an appropriate rent. And we're going to be downsizing tenants where we can, upsizing them where we can. And if they're not that same space, it's not going to be in the spread. So we went back to 2015 and did it based on the new calculation. We're going to be doing \u2013 we did it for 2016 in total. And I gave you the number for what it's been under the old methodology, but we think, this is better. And it will pick up the ability for us to do what we do best, which is grow our comp NOI. As I mentioned to you, that's what I focus on, that's what we \u2013 when we sit and go through the mall, we don't talk lease spreads, we talk about how we're growing the cash flow. And we've had this discussion, we had this discussion on tenant sales one year, we had the discussion on occupancy one year, now, it's lease spreads. My friend, we focus on cash flow growth. Now that's allowed us to increase our comp NOI by $1.2 billion and increased our dividend from $3.50 to $7. I don't know, what else I can tell you. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That was very helpful. And just a quick \u2013 a follow-up on Sears. You mentioned how you have almost no anchor vacancies in the portfolio and a little exposure to the closings that have taken place. Obviously, there is kind of speculation about maybe a larger volume at a faster pace coming back. Maybe you could just give a little bit of color on kind of how something like that might play out in terms of your portfolio even if it's maybe a longer-term positive, what would kind of be the short-term dislocation and kind of what do you think it would look like in terms of backfilling space? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, let me just \u2013 without \u2013 let me tell you why we've been able to grow our comp NOI is because we believe in our product and we invest in our product. And I think what we have seen from some in the retail world is, they're not investing in their physical stores and they're investing more online and the margins online are not what they are in the physical environment. And so, if they're not keeping up with our \u2013 the bargain that we're doing, we have \u2013 we'd love to get the space back and redevelop it. And so, we're prepared for any and all scenarios. Hopefully, they will invest in their stores, but if they don't we'd rather take them back and redevelop it. But Rick \u2013 I'll let Rick add to that as well. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: One of the things that we are doing, have been doing and will continue to do is we have a constantly updated grid on all the boxes that are interested in each of our properties and we know exactly where we can accommodate them based on the opportunities that present themselves. David mentioned in his comments, we've replaced over 80 of them in the last five years. We're ready, we've done it on a disciplined basis. All you have to do is look in our 8-K in every quarter, you're going to see all that activity, it's continuing and we are ready to do it. And in virtually every instance, where we have replaced an anchor, we've increased our sales, increased the number of reasons that people come to shop our properties and we've made good returns on our capital. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great, thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: David, just related to your comments regarding managing the business for cash flow, in terms of your approach to the leasing environment today. On one of the last calls you talked about your experience with A\u00e9ro and PacSun and maybe not offering as much rent relief going forward as you did in 2016 and just letting stores closed. And so with a lot of retailers out there today talking about store closures, just wondering what your thoughts are on managing that process today and are you seeing more request for rent relief than you did a year and two years ago. Just trying to piece together the noise and versus what you're actually hearing. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. I think that it's \u2013 Christy, I think it's safe to say we're seeing more request for rent relief. And I wish there were like \u2013 we're certainly prepared to look at it as leases expire. However, we're not going to go into 2018s, 2019s and 2020s for retailer who wants to do that. And the fact of the matter is, our view of it is, a lot of times they ask and you certainly don't lose anything by asking. So we do \u2013 we deal with it at, at least expiration and it really is a case-by-case basis. But I'll tell you a fascinating thing that I've learned at A\u00e9ro \u2013 with the A\u00e9ro investment. So and it's just the dynamic of Wall Street, retailers, chasing Internet sales, there is a whole philosophical discussion that will take too long on this call to do. But one thing at A\u00e9ro that I learned is that that management team could produce higher level of profitability, higher gross margins if they didn't have the Wall Street constraint on worrying about comp NOI or comp sales growth i.e. they could generate more cash flow because they're not worried about posting a comp sales number that's below market expectations. Well, I'm a business guy, okay. And I kind of like cash flows. So we've got this A\u00e9ro and we're still in a turnaround and I don't really know, how it's all going to work out. But it's like the management team has been unleashed in terms of how to run their business for profitability because they have no concern about posting a comp sales number that Wall Street wants to see. I'm not damning Wall Street, but the reality is sometimes it's okay, just to think about cash flow. And obviously, there is other metrics that people are more interested in. But we sat down and we focused on return on equity, cash flow growth, I mean, I think we'd see different dynamics from the retail community than what we have. But getting back to you, so the point is, if there is a lease action, i.e. a expiration, it's a case by case or more people are asking about it than in \u2013 than they were maybe a couple of years ago, the answer is yes. We did experience less store closures last year than we did in 2015, the way we had suggested we would, that's why our occupancy went up, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it, retail environment is not \u2013 it's not robust, it's doggy dog right now. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, with percentage rent still trending down a lot year-over-year, I'm just wondering is that decline still only being driven by sort of the pressure from international tourist spend or is there another point of weakness there? And as you think about 2017 and your 3% store NOI growth, what impact are you expecting from any further decline in percentage rent, should we start to see that impact to be? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I'm hoping it would stabilize. The reality, it's only because of this \u2013 the strong dollar and the tourism spend. It's \u2013 we've studied it. Look, there could have been \u2013 we have \u2013 I think the other thing to keep \u2013 I mean, we have energy oriented assets, Oklahoma, Texas, we have the peso, so I mentioned the euro, I mentioned the yen, but you throw in the peso, you throw in the Canadian dollar, I love that all, again, the energy market, that all had an impact on overage. I'm hoping the energy market is a little more stable. Obviously, the dollar, the currency is going to be a volatile year. We did our best guess by \u2013 we estimate every tenant and whatever, we have a formula that does it. But I mean, it's more of an art, not a science, we'll see but that's the sole impact, it's only because of the dollar and tourism. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just one final point of clarification on the re-leasing spreads just because we get asked about it a lot. With the change in methodology, is the rent relief that you granted last year still in the calculation or no? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning out there. Just a few questions here, David. First, obviously, we all read Internet, newspaper, whatever median it is and you hear all the retailers making noise. But in practicality, in your experience, you mentioned fewer store closings last year than 2015, how much sabre-rattling is there among the retailer to say hey, we're closing stores versus when you guys get in there, their talk is different? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well I think, it all depends upon what point are they in their financial equation. Look, I think \u2013 and again, this is more philosophical, but what we'd like to see from the retail community is a dedication back to improving the store environment. We think a lot of the capital that has been put forward has been to chase Internet sales, a lot of that has been done through promotional efforts. And between that and the promotions required to get them to buy online between the cost of shipping and the returns, it's not a great model for them. And we think it would be and we've done so much to drive traffic in our centers, we've got decks that all these retailers, we've sent out to them. We did a couple of tests in middle market malls about what we can do, we put an ice skating rink, we did concerts, we've done so much to drive traffic to the mall, to the store. We think, if they could pivot somewhat, it would do everybody a world of good. And at the end of the day, it is more profitable for them by and large, I'm sure there is a retailer here or there that would argue this. But it is much more profitable for them to have that transaction happen at the store, okay. And I just think there needs to be a pivot back towards that. And then I think it would be better for everybody's business. With that said, I mean there is a lot of noise, we're going to have to kind of go through the noise, I won't tell you though, Alex. I mean, the business is \u2013 we're growing now, we're pros at grinding, nobody does it better, nobody has ended up at the end of that grinding in a better spot than we have. We've done some of our best work in those grinding moments. We've got the group and the management team and the personnel. We don't have turnover, where Midwestern roll up your sleeves folks and it's not as much fun but we get the job done. I mean look at our balance sheet, $7 billion of liquidity, a 5.0% no floating rate debt, we did the most financing ever last year, so we got to deal with it. Don't really know how it will all shake out while we've been relatively conservative on our comp NOI, but that's not to say we don't have work to do to achieve that. Because I don't want to sugarcoat anything here, I mean we're in a \u2013 the retailer have to pivot in my humble opinion, what do I know, but in my humble opinion, they need to pivot a little bit and we're trying to encourage them to do that, but we'll see if we have any success in that. You know what I'm saying, Alex? Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. No, absolutely, I don't think anyone would ever say that you sugarcoat stuff. So, no I think it's clear. More to that point, though, the department stores seem to get a lot of headlines when they announced \u2013 Macy's announced (38:45) et cetera. You guys mentioned 80 boxes backfilled and that you have plans for basically all of them. Do you think that there is an ability to see just acceleration of conversion of department stores or based on supply and demand you actually don't want that many back at any one time, the pace that we're seeing right now, whether it be a Seritage or Macy's or whoever the department store chain is, the current pace that we're all seeing is actually the right pace to maximize supply and demand or do you think that you can increase that to get at more? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Alex, this is Rick. First, let me underline one point, which is we've analyzed all of our department stores. We know their sales, we know their occupancy cost, we know their market position. And these stores have \u2013 witness the fact that of all the closures that have taken place, virtually none have been in our portfolio and that's because the productivity of these stores in our portfolio and the profitability of these stores is in the higher quartiles of all of these operating fleets. That said, we are ready to take them back should the opportunity present itself, where we can make money and do it on a cost effective basis. We know what we will do with these stores if we get the opportunity. We are, in fact, marketing them now and going ahead with redevelopment plan. So we know we've got tenants lined up and what we would to do stores if they become available. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay, Rick. Thank you. Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thanks, Alex. Operator : And our next question is from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz - UBS: Hey. Good morning out there. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's out here. We are out here. Jeremy Metz - UBS: As you've got more of these anchor boxes back, F&B has played an increasing role (40:53) in terms of some of the re-tenanting of those spaces. I was wondering can you talk strategically about your desire to add more F&B. How do you weigh the credit risk versus doing more traditional in line, maybe just framing out how much of the portfolio is F&B today versus where you see it growing? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well I would say \u2013 yeah, one of the best things that we've done, we \u2013 the industry has done is add a lot better restaurants over the last five years. And I think, we've added, what, 275 was the number over the last five years. So we think, that's a trend to continue. We think one of the best things that we've seen in terms of our entrepreneurial focus has been on the F&B side and not only that, but also on the entertainment side. Like what we're doing at Clearfork, what we've done with some of the mills boxes. I think, that's a trend, I don't have the exact percent that we've increased it from X to Y. We can get that for you, I don't have in front of me. But it's clearly been a meaningful increase. And we do think, as some of these like Seritage joint ventures and even if we get some of the other department store boxes back, part of that will be to add F&B, to add entertainment. But also and I said a lot in my remarks and I'm not very eloquent, so I stumble over most of my words, but I mean we did add 3,000 units. I actually had us double-check that because I said, let's add that in our text, between apartments and hotels keys, we added three units over the last few years. So we do think, it's also, we know we failed at Copley and I'm not happy about that, is a mea culpa there. But the fact is we've added 3,000 units, which is not all profitable other than the Copley experience. And we think, a lot of that, that this stuff will be mixed use, as well. So it will be probably generally away from just pure apparel. If you see what we're doing in McAllen, when we took the Sears box down, we are adding like traditional retail, but the front of that will be five \u2013 is it four or five restaurants? Unknown Speaker : Five restaurants. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Five restaurants kind of front of the mall there. So I think that's going to be an absolute \u2013 continue a trend and we're seeing more and more exciting concepts like \u2013 look, Shake Shack came out of nowhere four, five years ago, great operator, great company, great people to do business with. But we're seeing more and more of that creativity coming in that whole category. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And, Jeremy, let me just say, it's not only just adding restaurants, but I encourage you to go out and visit the Westchester and Roosevelt Field and King of Prussia, and look how we are transforming the environment in which these food operators are conducting business in our properties; greatly enhanced seating areas, entertainment areas, play areas, you name it. So with a much more sophisticated environment, which we know will extend the stay of our shopper and attract a more affluent shopper, because they are more inclined to spend time in the environments we're creating. Jeremy Metz - UBS: Appreciate it. And would that include adding grocery stores at any point? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. I mean, we added Wegmans recently. We're under construction with 365, which is a Whole Foods product, and there is a bunch of other activities in that whole area. So we think that's a nice mix to add to. Jeremy Metz - UBS: Appreciate that. And if I could ask one more. I mean, in the opening remarks you mentioned no dispositions in 2017. Just given some of the commentary about the increased pressure in retailers, there is a secular change we are seeing in shopping online. Does this alter your view at all on the appropriate size of the portfolio long-term and strategically make you think about possibly considering for any more assets from you? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Look, I think we've always shown that we've \u2013 we'll prune. So, it is very likely that we'll sell additional assets throughout the year. But we're not \u2013 I do not believe in selling. You have to understand, I'm maybe a little bit different. But I look at the present value of the cash flow stream first when I decide whether we should sell or not. Obviously, we think the mall or the asset's going away, then that present value, you can get a \u2013 if you can get it for \u2013 you can get a little premium to the present value of that stream, it can go away. But we don't sell assets, because of my help or sales per square foot go up or down. I look at cash flow. That's worked for us, because \u2013 I mean, look at our balance sheet, look at our NOI growth, look at any metric you want to compare us against, nobody in this industry has done that. So that kind of strategy has worked, but we still have assets that probably don't fit in our long-term view point and if we can make a decent trade, we will. But we're not going to be \u2013 we're not going to give away stuff just because we think it might help our metrics. Jeremy Metz - UBS: I appreciate the color. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Just, David, I guess, I'm curious to build on your earlier remarks. What's the catalyst that you think is needed to allow retailers to make that pivot? Does it require more privatization of retailers, like you've done with A\u00e9ro? Is it we need e-commerce sales to slow, so that refocuses Wall Street maybe on profits? I'm just curious how that never-ending narrative converges maybe with the perspective of the mall owners, because it is a wide chasm and it \u2013 I'm curious what your perspective is. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think it takes leadership and courage. And I think they have to believe in the product that they are selling, and if you believe in the product, then you should invest in the product. And if you are a physical retailer, then your product is stores. And if you believe in the store model, you should invest in the stores. Just like we're in the mall business, we believe in the malls, we're going to invest in the malls, and it takes leadership. It's contrary to what Wall Street wants, because they want Internet sales and, I don't know, maybe Wall Street is right. But I think it is very easy to shop on the Internet. So, if you don't have a good looking physical store and good looking service, quality service, and if you don't have inventory in the store and you're promoting more online than going to the store, in my humble opinion \u2013 I don't know a lot, but in my humble opinion, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I would like a little bit more conviction in what they do. Let's talk about the casino business. You could say the gaming could all go online. But if you're Steve Wynn, you build the best product, you have the best service, and lo and behold, people show up, they gain, they participate, they stay there, and he gets great returns on equity. He has got unbelievable conviction and he puts his money where his mouth is. We need that in our business. What's hurt our business in retail, frankly, is that there has been too many leverage buyouts with too much debt, and we all know no matter how good a retailer you are, you're going to run into ebbs and flows. And lo and behold, when you run into that scenario, you've got a balance sheet that can't withstand it. I can't tell you how much pressure is because of that as opposed to because of the Internet. We can go chapter and verse, and what that also does means they don't invest in the stores. So there needs to be a complete shift. I don't have any influence with how they think and how they operate, but we have conviction in our business. We're going to invest in our product and we're going to drive traffic to our malls. And that's everything that we do. So you're going to see that from our stand. We're not going to starve our malls. We're not going to starve our marketing. We're not going to starve our personnel. We're going to try to be as efficient. We're going to look for return on investment to be as high as possible. But at the end of the day, we believe in our product, we have conviction in it, and we're going to invest in. And that's not to say the internet doesn't play a very important role. And we've all talked about the omni-channel and the seamless and this, that and the other, but my friends, it's more profitable to get the consumer to shop in your store. That's what we'd like to see a little bit more of. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And when you talked to the leaders at other retailers and your tenants, I mean, do you find that there is broad conviction of what the end game looks like for them, that mix they want between online and store based or is that still being felt out and that's really kind of the root of this uncertainty, the never-ending narrative? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think it's a lot more uncertainty than it should be. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And I'm just curious because you mentioned... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: In a sense, we're at their mercy, but we've been at their mercy before, but we'll figure a way to deal with it. I mean, that's what we do. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Has the way you asses tenant risk changed at all? Because like you kind of referenced is that transition to maybe more of an e-commerce or omni-channel platform is putting a lot of stress on these guys. So you could have a great experience for the retailers in your properties, but chain-wide they could be having issues, because of debt or other issues. Have you guys changed how you assess tenant health for people you sort of select for your properties? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we haven't \u2013 I mean, we're very \u2013 we're probably as conservative about tenant improvement or tenant allowance, given the balance sheet and for long-term than anybody. But I don't think that's changed. I mean, we have a great credit department. They do an analysis and we listen to them. That's not to say we won't experiment here or there, throw some spaghetti against the wall. But, no, I don't think that \u2013 I don't think, Jeff, that's changed at all in terms of how we'll underwrite that. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And I'm curious just on the share repurchase. Off-hand, do you know how much capacity you have remaining under your authorization? And, I guess, how are you thinking about future repurchases? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: $1.4 billion \u2013 look, I think we'll continue to do that, given kind of where the world is. Obviously, until you do our earnings, we -- there are some restrictions on that, I won't bore you with that. Look, we believe in that, but on the other hand, I think you've just got to be thoughtful about how you do this. I do think \u2013 I've seen retailers run into problems, because they brought stock back, because that's what they thought Wall Street wanted. And, again they did it. They did it because \u2013 and they did it \u2013 they didn't invest in their stores, because of that in some cases. And again, I'm not trying to be overly critical. I'm just \u2013 we've got to \u2013 our industry has to invest in its product, just like Amazon. What a great company. But, are they making investments? You betcha, in more ways than I can even keep track of. If we don't have that same conviction, or any industry, -- look at the drug companies. They invest in R&D for this drug. It's not that complicated. We don't invest in the physical product. We got no shot, and so you got to be careful. You can't buy so much stock back, and we've seen a little bit on the retail side that at the end of the day take the capital away from investing in your product. And so, we'll do it kind of like \u2013 I think we -- what did I say, we had $1.4 billion left. So we'll continue to take advantage of market imperfections. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's great. Thanks, guys. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Yes, good morning, everyone. David, you guys have a track record of kind of consistently beating your initial guidance, and I was looking for signs in your commentary about if guidance could be conservative in any way. You did mention that you might possibly have conservative same store NOI guidance for 2017. And I was just kind of curious why the conservatism and where could the potential upside come from. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think I outlined it in my talk, which was basically, first of all, Tayo, as you know, our FFO per share is higher than anybody in our peer group that I know of. If there is somebody in the retail that's \u2013 real estate that's got a better per share FFO growth, I would like to know it, but I've looked at all, everybody's numbers and I don't think anybody is out there. But put that aside, we are a large \u2013 and we are, obviously, the largest company in that space. So that puts even more pressure on a per share number than if you are a smaller company. But put that aside, I mean it's basically translation. Why are we being conservative? Translation, the retail world is squishy. We have the potential on the stronger dollar based upon what all of the stuff that's going on out there. And we think we are projecting in our numbers the highest \u2013 higher. We have very \u2013 not a lot of floating rate debt, but we do have debt that matures and stuff that we refinance it, and then our floating rate debt is the lowest in the industry, again. Right, Andy? Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Right. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: So it's about 6%, less than that? Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Right, 5%. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: 5%, see, I'm always more conservative. 6% \u2013 5%, so we're projecting a higher rate environment, we've got translation, strong dollar, we've got the impact on tourism, and a squishy retail world and that's our number. I mean, we've always beaten in the last \u2013 I don't even remember the last time we missed our numbers. I mean, does anybody here in this room know? It's a long time, it was \u2013 Rick was - Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.: In 42 of the last 44 quarters (58:39). David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. All right. So it's been a long time. I mean, over 10 or 11 years, that's a pretty damn good streak. I think Rick was 35 back then. The number is the number. Unknown Speaker : In diapers. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Got you. Then one more for me, if you could indulge me. Just in regards to the share repurchases, again, you guys have authorization for up to $2 billion. You've done about $600 million so far. Did a decent amount in fourth quarter, but doesn't seem like you have any share repurchases built into the 2017 guidance. Just kind of curious why not and kind of what decision process you go through to determine when it's best to kind of execute with the share repurchase program. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we want to take advantage of any market volatility and we're going to be conservative on it as well, and I explained to you, I think the most important thing for us to do is invest in our product. But the simple way to look at is we were planning this big Copley investment. It doesn't look like it's going to be, so I'm kind of thinking like, okay, let's reallocate that within reason towards share repurchase, because now we are not going to need the capital to build this tower, but at the same time, I've been more philosophical than I normally want to be on these. We're going to invest in our product. So it \u2013 we expect to do it over a period of time. It's hard to pinpoint exactly the number, so we think it's better just to tell you what the reality of our guidance is at this particular moment. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Got you. All right. Thank you very much. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, no worries. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hey, good morning/afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to ask a question. Sandeep on the GGP call earlier today talked about an increasing \u2013 tenants being more agnostic today about the type of retail that they're located in and more focused on just the overall quality. I am just curious if you guys share that sentiment and if so, how that is or may change the dynamic between your conversations with traditional mall guys that may be looking to go out of mall and vice versa, traditionally non-mall tenants that may be looking to get into the mall? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, certainly, I agree with that statement. But we've been a retail real estate company since we went public, as we've had a very diverse retail portfolio. We started with malls and community centers. We ended up participating in The Mills product. We ended up, obviously, participating in the outlet product. We spun-off the strip center business, the small mall business. So we think we have very deep relationships with all the retailers and we always have thought of our company as a retail real estate company, if you go back, from the get go. But I agree 100% with Sandeep's comments that \u2013 and that's why I do think the product, whether it's an outlet or a mall or a big power center, retailers are going to gravitate towards the best location with the most critical mass. And we do think that that \u2013 if, in fact, we do get some of these department stores back, we're probably going to have the ability, we're probably going to have some supply that will allow us to bring \u2013 create more critical mass with more diverse uses, and I think that will very much compete effectively with other products around the mall environment. We all know how retail has evolved. I mean, the mall location has always more or less been the central hub of retail in that community. So the fact that we're going to get potentially some of these department stores back, I do think that \u2013 and the critical mass is already a real advantage to the mall, that should bode well to increase the uses. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And I will tell you that we have already been in conversation with a number of retailers, whose predominant footprint is in power centers, and they are very anxious to come into our properties. The only constraint, as David has said, is being in a position to afford them enough square footage that meets their requirements with parking and visibility from the street, well, that's what all these department store boxes provide. And frankly, I alluded earlier to all of our conversations about redeploying these boxes. A lot of those conversations are being had with retailers that are now predominately in community and power centers. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We did an analysis, I won't name a name, but a well-known retailer, big retailer. I think we have 30 leases with them, and given where their rents are, we felt like we would only have to lease four boxes, four out of the thirty, to replicate the income stream. And I don't want to sit and name retailers and who knows whether we'll get those back. But, I mean, that's the opportunity. So you've got 30 leases, but they were done a gazillion years ago, and the quick and dirty analysis that we had is we had to lease four boxes to replicate that income stream. So the rest of the 26 or thereabouts, don't hold me exactly to these numbers, but it gives you the order of magnitude, that's exactly kind of the potential upside that we have, and now if in fact we get those leases back, we're going to have more product available, but we're also going to have, I think, great opportunities to increase our income stream. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks for that, and maybe just going back to A\u00e9ro. You sounded pretty positive on the ability of the management team to unleash some additional cash flow now. I was just curious if you could share some of the things that they're doing differently today than they were prior to the bankruptcy in terms of sourcing or merchandising or branding or even the price points that they are targeting. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I mean, they're doing all of that. I'd just say the simple thing is they're focused on \u2013 it's a different mindset. It's a more efficient company. It's a smaller company. It's more focused on gross margin, and it's got better relationships with its suppliers and they don't have to chase, unless you guys make us report what their comp sales are. But since it's a completely immaterial investment from us, don't expect me to provide it to you. We're focused on cash flow, which is liberating to that team, and frankly, liberating to us and the partners and I mean, it's great. It's interesting. We're learning a lot. We've still got ways to go. It's never easy to take a company out of bankruptcy, but we've got a shot at doing it. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And just last question on the FX headwinds that you mentioned that are embedded in guidance. Is there any quantification you can provide in terms of FFO per share impact or maybe just what you're assuming for yen and euro for the year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, obviously, we have, but I would focus on $11.55 times 361 million shares, which gives you our total FFO close to \u2013 what? Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.: $4.2 billion. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: $4.2 billion. Within that $4.2 billion of earnings, there is always going to be $100 million, thereabouts. I mean, we are a big company. I mean, I could give it to you, I have it here, but it would bore you. You don't need it. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Well, thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, don't worry about it, we'll do our best. Operator : And our next question is from Carol Kemple with Hilliard, Lyons. Your line is open. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Good afternoon. It sounds like your investment in A\u00e9ropostale has been a very educational and rewarding experience for you all. How is your appetite for doing a similar investment in the future? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, given how the market reacted to the A\u00e9ro deal, it's probably not high on the list. But I don't know, look, I think we've got to prove to ourselves that what we're doing there we're going to be able to accomplish. So, I would never rule anything in or out. It's not high on the list, so. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Okay. It'd probably be several years down the road. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's just not high on the list. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Okay. And then in the quarter, your G&A expense was up a little bit from last year and from the third quarter. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Was there anything one-time? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes, there was. Our General Counsel retired, as you're aware, and so basically the pop is also associated with that retirement. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. I know we're over an hour, so I'll just try to be quick with two here. The first was in terms of The Limited, there one of the retailers that we've heard are going to be closing stores and we counted about 75 in your portfolio back in December. So, I was wondering if you could comment on your plans and any progress so far in backfilling that space. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Obviously, that has been on the horizon for a while. We have been actively leasing their spaces there across our platforms and we've already got a significant number of those spaces, where we are processing leases and our proposals out to a lot of tenants. And we will deal with it just like we've dealt with all the others that have come down the pike and the ones that will come down the pike tomorrow. The best defense to all of these things is having great properties. And as David's been articulating, we're spending the money to have great properties. And when you have great properties, you have demand, and the downside is just the downtime while we replace them. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then in the prepared remarks earlier you guys touched on the gift card sales and traffic being generally up, and that being a good indicator. I'm just wondering since we get asked, is that how you judge traffic, by the gift card sales or is it by a number of things meshed together? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we have traffic counters in a handful of malls that supports that statement. We also have parking counters in all of our outlet business, which I think was up 1.5%. Right, guys? So it's a combination of what we have invested in the mall \u2013 in the mall thing with basically our camera technology and then the traffic parking counters in our outlet business. Unknown Speaker : And just a quick follow-up on that, up 1.5% in the outlet, was that for the year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon. Just two quick questions here. First of all, on how you're classifying the same-store pool, I think it changed to comparable for the period compared to at the beginning of the period for past quarters. Is my understanding correct? And if so, is that so you can sort of better capture redevelopment, development projects that might be included in the same-store pool that come on during the course of the year, but might not have been there at the beginning of the year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. It comes in the year that is after a year, so it comes in that quarter after a year, so it's not a change at all. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So no change in how you're reporting the same-store pool? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Correct. I mean, that pool changes, because if it's been open a year, it goes into that pool. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No, no, no, I get that. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: But \u2013 yeah, no, no, no. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then just maybe more specifically Bangor Mall, I recognize that was a property with Macy's in it. I did notice it was classified under other properties, whereas previously it was malls. Any sort of thoughts as to if that's meaningful or how we should think about that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Extremely immaterial. Our FFO contribution from Bangor Mall is $1 million out of $4.2 billion. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I recognize it's immaterial. I was just wondering, it moved to other properties, at least from a CMBS perspective, is that...? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's immaterial. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Just wondering, are there any updates on the Kl\u00e9pierre stake that we should be thinking about or how the McArthurGlen investments are progressing? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Generally, the business on both fronts is decent. Kl\u00e9pierre reports next week, so I can't add much more than that, and McArthurGlen has been a terrific investment for us. We open a big mall in Provence in April. And it's actually gone better than we anticipated and a great partnership. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay, that was it. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon, I guess, we've just passed the 12 :00 hour. Quick question, David or Rick, you mentioned 434 department stores today, one vacancy. How many department stores in five years' time do you expect to have in your portfolio? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: You want a number? It would be just a guess. I mean, my guess, it will be \u2013 if I have to guess, I don't know, maybe \u2013 it really depends on the one big guy out there, so I can't \u2013 I don't want to guess. It will be less than that, but I don't want to put a number on it. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Is there potential where we could see maybe a halving of that or 40% reduction of that, in your view? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. No, no, no way, no way, no way. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I don't see it. No, I don't see that. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: And then maybe a related question, your $278 million investment in Hudson's Bay, what are the plans for that and is that company mulling a potential IPO similar to Seritage? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, it's always the possibility. I don't think it's been a huge focus at this point. The investment's going according to what we thought it would be. We're looking to grow that partnership with some redevelopment of that portfolio and potentially some other transactions. But at this point pretty stable. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. And then last maybe, but not least, you mentioned there is a weighing in your capital allocation between buying back your stock and investing in your real estate and always trying to maintain a healthy investment in your real estate. Do you have sort of a target of how you think about that per annum, in terms of reinvestment versus the obvious attraction of buying back your own stock right now? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, I think the investments that we make at this point are extremely accretive, because the redevelopment, new development I think on average is 8-plus percent. So, that's had a multiple that is lower than buying our stock back. And, obviously, as you know, we've always \u2013 the most important thing we can do besides that is have a balance sheet that can withstand whatever craziness that maybe out there. So \u2013 and those are the two priorities. And then as well \u2013 and then frankly, we'll dabble in the other one when the markets \u2013 when we're out of favor and the market, for whatever reason, doesn't believe in our product, we'll try to add to that. But we still have a number of accretive investments. We're at 8% plus and we want \u2013 we, obviously, want a balance sheet that continues to \u2013 I would not look \u2013 I would not overlook the fact that our coverage is 5.0. I mean, I know people rather talk about leasing spreads, but that's something to mention. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Agreed. It's very few of your peers have that. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. But we'll dabble, but it's not going to be a priority. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you, Floris. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Just a follow-up in terms of capital allocation, could you comment on tenant allowances in new leases? What should we expect going forward? Is that you're at the point at which you have some leverage over their capital allocation in their space? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The TA has been very constant year-over-year and it's right in line. It's right around $40 a foot, and that's what it's been for the new leases. Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Just had a related question to that. You talked a lot about reinvesting in the malls. So, besides redevelopment towers, should we just longer term expect to maybe a change or increase in operational CapEx overall? And then maybe you could talk about how that differs for different quality mall spectrum. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I don't think, Simon. I think we've been pretty active. We still have \u2013 we're about to start on a major redo of Boca Town Center, this \u2013 once we get all the permits. We've done a lot of work. I mean, the good thing about what we've done is, once we kind of felt like the world \u2013 we had a big pike, we had 2008-2009 hit. We chased a couple of deals. We got a couple, but we didn't get everything, and in 2009, at the end in 2010, we've been very active on redevelopment. In fact, we've done a lot of good stuff. So we still have a lot to do, but we've done a vast majority. So I don't think there's going to be this significant change. But we have got to invest in the product. We will continue to do so. Certainly we still have a reasonably stable economy. And let's also put in perspective about everything, and the economy grew, the GDP was 1.6%. So if you take out 1% of inflation or thereabouts, I mean, that's pretty pathetic. So we're holding our own in a very, very non-real growth environment. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And just a quick one. There is some volatility or decreases in management fees and operating costs. Any comments around that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, it's all related to WPG and losing those management contracts. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, guys. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question is from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, hi. There was a Journal article not long ago discussing how Washington Prime has Amazon Lockers in 50 of its centers. Do you have any of these in your malls, and if so, has it shown to be an additional traffic driver or a source of conversion at the other stores? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We do not and better luck for them, to answer that. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our last question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy, and thanks for staying through lunch time. David, in your opening remarks and the list of things you said you were not going to talk about, but you talked about, you mentioned Main Street Fairness, and I'm curious where things stand with the administration on trying to get that through. And at the same time, how much time you're spending with your retailers on border adjustability and how that could impact them, and is this the year in terms of how all the stuff will unfold? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, listen, on Marketplace Fairness Act, I don't think it's an administration issue. It's really a Congress issue. The Senate's ready to go. What I gather, the administrations understand it. It's really being held up by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He's actually had \u2013 his district has actually come under \u2013 had some tough retail news that's come out of his district. Frankly, I don't understand it. I don't get why there has been no progress there, but I don't believe it to be an administration issue. It's really just one committee in Congress that's sitting on it, and it's a travesty. And we've all lobbied, but \u2013 I mean, it needs to change. It's just not fair. And if anything, the government should be about fairness and not picking winners and losers. At the end of the day if the consumer wants to shop online as opposed to bricks and mortar, that's life in the fast line, but they shouldn't choose that because they can save sales and use tax that they already own. And I mean it's a sad state of affairs that hasn't been done. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Well, I guess if we have a new President that's focused on jobs and if online is stealing sales away from bricks and mortar, that's affecting profitability of some of them, one would imagine that's a job issue. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, yeah and not only that, but what the courts \u2013 there is a number of states that are going to basically overturn the Supreme Court decision anyway, in our opinion. So it's just \u2013 they are taking it out of Congress' hands and it's just going to end up in litigation in every state, and it's silliness. It ought to be done, but \u2013 I mean, I don't know what else to tell you. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You also mentioned gift card sales as a predictor. How much of the gift card sales are coming back and being spent in Simon Malls? And are you able to determine what that activity, where \u2013 what type of retailers is it going towards in terms of the people who are actually using the cards? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We actually can't keep track of it. But I think in \u2013 we think, just anecdotally, that there is a good percentage of that, very high percentage. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just lastly, we've seen a number of retail locations bring in the Amazon Lockers. And I'm curious more so on the logistics companies and I don't know if you listened to UPS' call this morning, but the fourth quarter they saw 10.5% increase in deliveries to residential homes, which was the largest increase that they've seen in 10 years, and that they are wrestling with how to deal with that volume of packages that are needed to go. I'm just curious if you've had conversations with the FedExs and the UPSs of the world to leverage the significant amount of parking field (1:26:55) that you have for that last mile delivery, if perhaps retailers are shipping from store, doing other things, where you create a little bit more of a vertical perspective. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, look, we've invested in Deliv, which basically is \u2013 the mall group is basically invested in that. There is couple of other concepts out there that we're looking at clearly. We do think shipping from store, picking \u2013 delivery or pickup at the stores is all very important and the mall, we think, will play a big role in that. But, again, we think lot of the online activity, on the research that we've done, one of the highest things is price and saving the sales tax. And that equalizes and we do think a lot of retailers are promoting a lot more to get online business than they are in the physical world. I mean, all that can balance out pretty quickly. We'll have to see. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. I guess, is there a probability you put on Main Street Fairness this year or (1:28:14)? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Honestly, I don't understand it. It's the most frustrated thing we've had to deal with. You've got jobs at risk. You've got \u2013 it's not fair. You're going to have Congressmen in certain districts where retail facilities close, because of it potentially. You're going to have less sales revenue in those states, in those jurisdictions. It is one of the most confounding things I have ever seen. The courts are going to take it out of Congress' hand, and it makes no sense to me and I'm hopeful the administration knows that. But I don't think their \u2013 I don't think this is their issue. I mean, I think it's stuck in one particular area of Congress and it makes no sense to me. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. But one would hope the administration potentially can use blunt force and some other things (1:29:26). David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I can't comment on that other than, obviously, I'm encouraged by the focus generally on business being part of the equation to get this economy growing. That to me has been very encouraging to see. What can we all do to make this economy grow better and faster. And I \u2013 that to me has been encouraging. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Okay. Thanks for the time, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Okay. I think, operator, I think that's it, right? Operator : That is all the questions. Yes, sir. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Sorry to have kept everyone so late. But as you know, we want to answer any and all questions that you may have. We appreciate your support, your interest, your questions, and I'm sure we'll talk to you all soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We got a great start to the year, we continue to achieve strong financial results that exceeded our expectations. We opened two new international outlets in April. We amended and extended our $4 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our strong financial flexibility. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.74 per share, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. As a reminder, the prior-year period included a net benefit of $0.08 in FFO per share from a gain on the sale of two residential assets. Normalizing the FFO per share growth rate for the gain in the prior-year period, FFO per share increased approximately 7.5%. We believe the FFO per share consensus for the first quarter did not include an estimate of our share of the losses from A\u00e9ropostale, which is typical for a retailer in the first quarter. Our share of those operating losses in the first quarter was $0.03. Even though on an annual basis, we measure ourselves versus our plan, and not first-call estimates, let's put in perspective that we have beaten first-call estimates 42 out of the last 44 quarters. The only two misses were one-time write-offs, in 2009, which was the year of The Great Recession. This is an unprecedented performance for the REIT industry, and the S&P 500. Now, let's go to operating metrics and cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for our space across the portfolio, as evidenced by our mall and premium outlets occupancy end of the quarter at 95.6%, which was flat year-over-year. Leasing activity remains solid, average base minimum rent was $51.87, up 4.4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand and pricing power for our locations, the malls and the premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.31 per square foot an increase of 13%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for the malls and outlets was $615 per foot compared to $613 per foot in the prior year period, an increase of 30 basis points. We are pleased to see retail sales increased from the prior year as well as the seasonally strong fourth quarter, also please keep in mind that Easter was in April this year compared to March of last year, which has a real impact on our many leading tourist oriented properties. Total portfolio NOI increased a very strong 5.6%, or over $80 million for the first quarter and comp increased a strong 3.8% for the quarter. Our best properties are industry-leading assets and large markets and drive the cash flow, growth and profitability of our business. We understand that many of you believe that standard operating metrics just mentioned are of most interest. However, it is important to remember that each of those metrics reflecting equal weighting of each of the properties across our portfolio. We believe it is important to understand our operating metrics on an NOI weighted basis, which more truly reflects the performance of the portfolio. With that said, if we had done that, reported retailer sales on an NOI weighted basis would be $765 compared to the $615, the average base minimum rent would be $67.60 compared to $51.87. Leasing spreads would increase to 16.4% compared to the 13%. We have the largest portfolio of the highest quality retail real estate in our industry. These high quality properties drive the growth and cash flow of our business, and what and where retailers want to be located and consumers want to shop and create memorable experience. These weighted metrics clearly demonstrate the highly \u2013 higher quality nature and more accurately reflect the health of our portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 25 properties across all three platforms with our share of net cost at approximately $1.1 billion. Construction continues on several major ones, which we've mentioned before, including the Galleria in Houston, La Plaza Mall, Woodbury Common, and Allen Premium Outlets, most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months. Subsequent to the quarter end, we opened two new international outlets with our partner Shinsegae Group, we opened Siheung Premium Outlets in Seoul, South Korea, this center is our fourth premium outlet and build upon its tremendous success we've enjoyed in the region. And with our partner McArthurGlen, we opened Provence Designer Outlet, the first luxury designer outlet in the South of France, construction continues on another full-price development at Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, Neiman Marcus recently opened and the mall will open in the fall of this year. And we have three new outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia, two in international markets including Malaysia and Canada. Our share of those four is approximately $300 million. Last week with our partner McArthurGlen, we also acquired Rosada Designer Outlet, a leading outlet center in Netherlands with significant growth opportunity. Just turning quickly to our capital markets, we are very busy as usual, we refinanced our $4 billion revolving credit with the 2022 maturity date our fortress balance sheet with access to many forms of capital continues to differentiate us among our peer group. Our liquidity stands at more than $7 billion. During the quarter, we also extended our $2 billion share repurchase, and we repurchased 870,000 shares of our common stock. And today we announced a dividend of $1.75 for the quarter, which again is an increase of 9.4% year-over-year. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance in the range of $11.45 to $11.55 per share, which is approximately 6% growth compared to our comparable FFO per share growth, which we believe will lead our retail real estate industry peers. This expected growth is a testament to the strength of our company and our ability to actively manage our portfolio to provide industry-leading returns to our shareholders, even in the current choppy retail environment. We now welcome your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. Good morning out there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, how are you? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm doing great. I'm doing great. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : We can hear that. We can hear that in your voice. So, quickly David, first, you guys have a long track record of beating and raising guidance, but you've equally been upfront about the challenges out there in the market. So, just very curious, the no-raise in full-year guidance this year is that because, yeah, there is more A\u00e9ro post-out losses that potentially come up this year as you run that business? Or is it just general caution or you're seeing some things out there as your leasing folks come back or operations people come back that give you a little bit of pause? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, I would say, the entire \u2013 again, 42 out of 44, that's 11 years, is that 11 years guys? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's 11 years. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's 11 years, okay. So, the missed from first call consists was entirely A\u00e9ro, which is very typical for a retailer to have operating losses in the first quarter. So, I would \u2013 in answer to your question simply, it's a little bit of both. I mean A\u00e9ro is a fourth quarter business for \u2013 like most retailers. And there is a range of outcomes there, we're still very comfortable with our investment but there is a range of outcomes that's a little harder to predict. So we're being a little more cautious in that front. And then obviously on the retail front, I mean, we've got some retailers that were trying to navigate exactly what might happen and so we're being a little more cautious on that front. We're not backing off our comp NOI number even with that uncertainty in the retail world and we'll see. But, I mean, we're not backing off on it, and I'm optimistic that we'll continue to perform very well. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then the second question is, you guys made the lifetime fitness announcement, but just curious, in general, yeah, you spoke in the past about a lot of apparel brands in the malls and the need to diversify, but at the same time there is also a consumer that's much more fickle they don't, yeah, I mean, there was a Neiman Marcus article, but the shopper is much more conscientious about where they are. Overall, one, the ability for you guys to really diversify out of apparel into other uses of the mall, how is that going; and two, are you seeing the brands themselves get more serious about understanding that the consumer has changed and therefore full price as full price may not just work anymore, they need to invest more, are you seeing the retailers themselves adapt? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I'm hopeful that the retailers will focus on improving their in-store experience and that could be a lot of different ways, that could be through technology, that could be through a better look and feel, that could be through better merchandise et cetera. Now, I will tell you, I mean, this is the great narrative that is being absolutely ignored by the national media. And I continue to tour properties each and every week as does Rick, as does our team, the traffic is there. It's so funny when all the malls go out of business, what are these poor people going to do instead of going to the mall. I don't know, I mean, I just think the narrative is a way ahead of itself, the traffic is strong, it was up throughout our portfolio were we measure it, but you know at the end of the day, we've all got to have a better experience for the consumer, because they're tough nut to crack. We also need a growing economy. I mean our GDP growth is going to be anybody's guess, what's your guess, Alex? Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : GDP something probably in the 2%, a little over 2%. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, what is it for this first \u2013 what is that for this first quarter? Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : It's subdued. It's subdued, but if we get anything out of DC, it should be better. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I mean, I have been waiting a lot of stuff for DC, I'm still waiting for the internet sales taxation fairness to kick-in. So, the reality is people are going to the good centers, traffic is up, our sales even with Easter being in April are up. Our NOI is up, our comp NOI is 3.8%, we've certainly got some retailers that have not performed the way they wanted to or should have, a lot of that was driven by the private equity leveraging up. These businesses more than just the common theme, which is the internet. I'm hopeful that they're going to reinvest in their stores, improve their inventory mix, and service their customer better. And, by the way, we've got to have the same pressure on us to do that. So, it's a two-way street. We are up for the challenge. We have the conviction in our business to do that as you know if you go through our properties by and large, they look they feel great. We're going to redevelop a lot of opportunities. I think any department stores, if and when we get back, are great opportunity for the company. King of Prussia is a great example, Penney's announced closing. We could have saved that deal, we decided absolutely unequivocally not. We're going to make that a mixed-use development, won't be apparel-oriented. So again, we're frustrated only by the narrative, but not by what's happening in our business. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, thank you. I'm here with Craig Schmidt. David, Rick, to be a little bit more specific on the retailers, there have been many more plans announced for spending in bricks-and-mortar for closings. I guess, can we be a little bit more specific and help us, provide your latest view, are you happy with the current announcements, is it enough because the last couple of years you have been asking for this? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we don't \u2013 we really do not comment \u2013 I'm not sure I understand your question. But we really don't \u2013 we don't think this is a good form to comment on retail specific issues. As I said, there are things I'm happy to comment on like, we are \u2013 apparel has been in the doldrums, we are moving our mix away from that, I think we've done that already, we've lowered it Rick by... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That was 5% or 6%. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. We've lower that already. We do think private equity has been more of a detriment to our and by the way most of these guys are my buddies, okay. But I mean, when you lever up, you lever up any business, whether it's the mall business, the retail business, and you can't invest in your product, then you got a problem. We've seen a lot of that. I'm happy to talk to you about that trend, but I'm not sure \u2013 I'm not going to sit here and comment on specific retailers, I'm not really sure Jeff what you're after, explain it? Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess, are you feeling better now that the retailers are finally talking about specific investments in the stores pruning some of their portfolios, it feels like finally they are taking some action before, or Craig and I said, it is a little confusing to figure out, are these winning formulas or not? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think my concern about how they overspent in the Internet versus the store fleet continues to be a concern for me. But I do think they're starting given that the returns in the online between free shipping and free returns is no man's land form and the price transparency and no service add, value add, I hopefully, they'll recognize that they should pivot toward the in-store experience. And I think that's beginning to happen. I also think as I've mentioned to you in the past that there is a number of Internet \u2013 pure Internet retailers that will not be able to really sustain their business model and my humble opinion unless they have a physical presence. So, they're still cleaning out to do and we will suffer from that like anybody else, but at the end of the day, if there is less retail space in the United States and I expect there to be, so I'm not suggesting that it won't be, we will be the net beneficiary of that because of the vastness of our portfolio and scale helps and a big balance sheet helps. So we've got $7 billion of capital ready to go to work in whatever form we can do to increase our profitability. And so we'll weather the storm like we have in the past, we've done some of our best work when it's the most foggiest and that's what we do, and that's why we're making $11.50, that's why that's the REIT's highest per share number and that's why dividends grow more than anybody else, and I don't know what else to tell you, that's what we do. I'm not \u2013 we haven't backed off our comp NOI. Do we have to work to get to the 3%? You're darn right, but we put that pressure on us each and every year and yeah, sometimes we don't get to the finish line, but we get pretty damn close most of the time. So again, I have no idea if I'm answering your question, but that's what we do. Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That helps, thanks. And Craig has just one quick question. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, great. Thanks. Just given the strength and shift to some of the value and discount retailers. I'm wondering if we may see the introduction of more value off price like Marshalls at Del Amo and T.J. HomeGoods at Prien Lake Mall. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think there'll be a little bit more of that for sure. They do a great job, a lot of the discounters. And I think there is a great opportunity for us to bring them in into the mall environment. Not \u2013 you wouldn't want to do it in every mall environment, but certainly there is a handful of malls that make sense to do that and I do think that will continue. And look, reality is \u2013 the mall \u2013 and again, this is what frustrates us is that the traffic that we see in the malls is good. So yeah, we can always point out to a mall that's gone out of business or the mall that's done, that's got no traffic, like we can at hotel, like we can \u2013 movie company that makes movies and they have a flop, doesn't mean all movies are a flop. It just means that one movie they have is a flop. We could talk about network TV and talk about the lineup that all they have and they have a new show that's a flop. Well, it's conceivable that in our portfolio we have a couple of flops, but it's immaterial. That's why we gave you those weighted NOI statistics to reinforce that. But the reality is that we do think that in some of these properties, we will be able to bring in some of that \u2013 because I think some of these centers that they're in and the strip center will might suffer a little bit, and they're going to go where the traffic is. And in most cases it's the mall environment, not everyone, but in most cases. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, it's Michael Bilerman. The good news is Mall Cop and this is not a flop. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The Mall Cop, the number two wasn't that great, but I think the first one was pretty good. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. So, David, strategically over the years, you've been able to adapt to different cycles, right. You're very early on in the consolidation wave, focusing on these big major market malls. You got into the outlet business, when you bought Chelsea, you bought Mills, enhancing sort of all the value retail. You sold off or spun-off certain lower-quality weaker malls, lower productivity smaller assets. You expanded globally and you had a rock-solid balance sheet. So as we think about adapting to the cycle, where is your main focus? Is it adapting and putting more mixed use at your properties? Is it may be going further global? Do you want to focus on other forms of retail, and I don't know maybe get back into the strip center business? Is it really focusing on this whole model of the future and the consumer experience in taking ownership of the consumer at your mall? I guess \u2013 or is it something completely else? How should we be thinking about your next adaptation to the cycle? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well it's very, very good question. So, let's just talk about our businesses in those segments. Our European and Asian business is actually very strong. So that's good news. Our outlet business and mills business continues to prosper, continues to have very good comp NOI growth. And the mall business generally is dealing with a lot of the retailers that we generally understand and know that are out there in the public. However, the great opportunity I think in that business will continue to be reclaiming the department stores and our opportunity to redevelop them that will further expand the mix, whether it's mixed use, whether it's lifetime, whether it's some community-oriented activity. But I think that's going to be a big focus for us is, how do we take advantage of the department store, we do and I think Sandeep has done a very good job explaining this, we do probably have too many department stores in each, in the mall business. And so, but instead of looking that as a concern, given that they pay no rent, we actually think that's a great opportunity for our redeveloping the mall to the next level. And again, I don't think there is any cookie-cutter answer, but since they don't provide any income, there is nothing but upside in how we redevelop and redevelop those assuming we get the appropriate return on cost. So, I would certainly say that's a very important phase what we've got to focus on. And I'd say the next very important phase is we do continue to bring technology into the mall environment, just like many retailers are bringing technology hopefully to their in-store environment. And I think what that will do is make the shopping trip more convenient, more productive, and they'll gain more knowledge by going through the mall. And we've right now under development in a pretty significant way to deliver product, probably realistically a year from now that might facilitate that with also collecting the data, that's important to be able to communicate directly with the consumer. So I would say, those are two areas. And then obviously, we're going to be opportunistic, that's just the way we are. There are no current plans to be opportunistic, but that's just part of our core culture here is to try and be opportunistic when we can. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. My second question is, you talked about the narrative that effectively every models did despite the traffic in sales that are going on in your assets. And I'm curious, if you can share with us some of the tone of your leasing discussions with both the bricks-and-mortar retailers that are expanding and want to open stores and how those discussions or negotiations are going with the overarching negative narrative that's out there. But also discuss how those discussions are going with the pure e-tailers that are expanding their bricks-and-mortar presence? And whether there's a difference, clearly the narrative is only on one-sided with all these tenants that are shrinking their store base or going bankrupt. Clearly there has to be some positive to produce the sales of a traffic that you're talking about? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. And I want Rick to answer that. But again, the ones that essentially, if you really cut through it all, the ones that aren't surviving in a tough REIT apparel environment or the ones that were highly levered and had the imprint of private equity on it, okay. And again, I'm going to get a lot of criticism from all my buddies, but that's the truth. So if you look at kind of where that pressure point has been, it's more than just our apparel business is bad, it's because, well, they couldn't survive with leverage on it. They paid a special dividend, they bought stock back, they did some financial maneuvering that increased the pressure that wouldn't allow them to deal with a kind of non-robust meddling environment. With that said, I'd like Rick to comment on the rest of it. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I would tell you Michael, the key as in all of these things is the person with the most compelling properties is going to win and all you have to do is, visit some of our properties like King of Prussia, ,like Galleria, like Sawgrass Mills, like Woodbury across the four platforms and you will see new retailers, both the e-tailers and the international retailers and our existing brands and new designer brands that all wanted to take advantage of the space that is becoming available either because we created it, because we took back space from underproductive retailers or we consolidated those on productive retailers into more productive space to free up space. There is still very compelling demand out there across each of the ones that you talked about. Are we fighting about rent? Sure. But we've been fighting with our tenants about rent for 40 years, that doesn't change. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you, guys. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. I've just a couple of questions. Maybe Rick and David, just to kind of follow that theme on leasing. I know occupancy was flat year-over-year, but you had a little bit of a bigger decline sequentially. I know that there is always a decline sequentially, but it seems to be a little bit bigger and probably stems from some of the bankruptcies. Can you maybe just talk or help quantify, how much of that space has been released and do you have any kind of occupancy goals that you can share with us for the end of the year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Steve, I would just simply say the metrics are the metrics we focus more on comp NOI growth. And I mean, obviously, if you go back in a little bit of 2015 we had more bankruptcies than 2016. This year, we'll probably have more in 2017 and certainly 2016. And some of these are still in a state of flux. So, I would not want to like tell you where our occupancy is, other than to say we haven't backed off the comp NOI number of three. Like I said, we're got a lot of work to continue to do, but that comment I would say first quarter in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, I mean that's just the way we look at our business. So, that's the number that we're more focused on than sales per square foot, rents spreads, and occupancy, it's all manifest itself. You put it all in a blender and it all manifests itself into one number and that's the number that I care about. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Right, I think \u2013 well, now I understand that, I think just to the extent that there was maybe a step or step-and-a-half back and people just want to see the progress moving forward, which obviously will manifest itself in NOI growth. I think if there was just a way to help quantify how much of that's maybe already been put to better lease, might just give some clarity that leasing remains strong, but... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look we're making deals, I mean and we're moving the pile. If we worth-making deals given the bankruptcies and the store closures that we're dealing with, we couldn't produce the 3% comp NOI number, that we weren't doing new business. So that's how I would answer that. I mean, again, I don't \u2013 we don't look at occupancy the way you might and I'm not disrespecting how you might look at it. I'm just telling you, the way we run our businesses for comp NOI or cash flow growth and we're not \u2013 if we didn't have any new lease up given the bankruptcy and store closures that exist in our industry, we wouldn't be able to get to that 3%. So I hope that gives you at least some trend as to how we feel about leasing up some of that space. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Okay. I guess, secondly, you've mentioned traffic strong and it's upwards measured and you said it's good. Do you have any sort of stats you could share and if you've done anything sort of technology-wise in the malls to help quantify this and if you have, is that data that you'll be sharing with us over time to perhaps comment (34:43) David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, you know how I feel. I think we have given you plenty of data, okay. So the odds of us giving you more data are not great, but I will tell you that in the \u2013 we don't have traffic counters in every mall, but we have in a good percentage of our malls and I standby that traffic comment, we have parking counters in our outlet business and when you factor in through April and I had it somewhere but I can't find it. If we have it through April, our traffic overall in \u2013 because it's important to remember, March had Easter of last year. The traffic \u2013 the parking counters in our outlet business is up one or, I'm sorry, Rick now has the number in front of me, 2%. So that gives you a barometer when you look at, if it was through March in the outlet business, it would be essentially \u2013 we look at it by region, be essentially flat. But it's up 2% given the \u2013 if you go all the way through Easter in April. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks. And I guess just last question. As you think about sort of CapEx and what you need to spend to kind of maintain malls or to keep the cash flow growing, do you get a sense that there may be a higher level of CapEx that's needed to generate that 3% compounded CapEx. And do you sense that the returns on the boxes that you may recapture might change possibly to the downside as you take these stores back? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I don't think so at all because we're up against very little income against those boxes. So it's a function of what you pay for them and what the income is and the last thing we'll do is hold. I mean, that's not to say we don't make silly decisions here. But we know we can back into what the right number is to buy that box. Like King of Prussia, we get it for free. It's a lease. The lease ends, I think, in 2020. And they're going to pay the rent all the way through it, which is great, we get to redo our plans, maybe we'll get the mat early, but that's all given that lease payment, I mean that's a lot of upside. So, I think it's possible a deal here or there, it might be, but that's always been the case, and Steve as you know, we spent a lot of capital in the portfolio to upgrade the look and feel. We're going to continue to do that, the worst thing that we can do and this is a comment for everyone. And the whole \u2013 is not invest in our business, that's the worst thing you can do. And I've seen it, and I don't care if it's a hotel, an office building, a movie business, the network business, the internet business, if you don't invest in your product, you can't continue to produce returns, that's the nature of Corporate America. And so, we're going to continue to invest, I think the returns will be there, and I don't think the dynamics of today's current environment have changed that. So, that's what we see, but again if something changes, I think it's a fair question and if we feel a trend there we'll start to set expectations differently. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks. That's it from me. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Your line is open. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Just on the buyback, we've talked in the past about kind of how the role you see stock buybacks and how you used in the past with around specific catalyst. And maybe you could just comment on the buyback in the first quarter and given where your evaluation is, how you think about that as a use of your free cash flow relative to redevelopments and other uses? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, the good news is, we'll not crowd out our investment in our product. That's the most important thing you cannot do. And we've seen it as an example at the department store level where stock buybacks have crowded out store investment. We will not let that happen. On the other hand, we have spent a lot of capital on our portfolio. You know kind of what we expect there. And other than \u2013 I think the first quarter should continue to give you an expectations of what we'll continue to do. Obviously, the price is lower. And you do come into a blackout period that you're all familiar with. That has almost gone. And we think, I mean, you can do the math, we believe in our business, we believe in our product, we can do both and we will do both. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. So, this is sort of \u2013 you see right now at least at kind of these levels, there is sort of a recurring role to play for the buyback alongside your other CapEx initiatives? That's fair? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think that's a fair assessment. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. And then just kind of secondly, a lot of people kind of have concerns about the outlet industry just because of what seems to be a disproportionate share of the apparel and accessories retailers, which has been a tough segment more broadly, and I was wondering, because you lump them together, broadly \u2013 although, I appreciate the traffic comment, if you could talk about maybe, whether there is much of a disparity in terms of kind of the momentum there from, I think, same-store NOI perspective? And then maybe, if Rick is able to provide some of the retailers who are sort of kind of taking space that, it might be coming back from other segments that are liquidating investment like that... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up, because we've heard this like, chatter. Absolutely, unequivocally the business is strong. It's so far from the chatter, I don't really know how to react other than we can start breaking out statistics again and my goodness, we'd like to be viewed in totality about our entity as opposed to a bunch of statistics, but the reality is absolutely not, it's that chatter is inaccurate, the only pressure that we've seen in the outlet business, which we've been consistent in describing, is we have a number of tourist-oriented centers, and given the strong dollar, we continue to see muted spending because the tourism and all of the psychology of coming to America is different than it was maybe a few months ago. We're dealing with that, but if you isolate those, it's absolutely au contraire, I wanted to show people, if all my years of going to Paris, I can speak French, and no, that chatter is just wildly false. So, I don't know, what else to tell you. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: I was just wondering if Rick can maybe talk about something that were (43:20) growing in that segment in particular? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean you garble there. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Oh, sorry, I was just seeing if Rick could maybe talk about any of the retailers that are sort of taking space like he's done in the past, but particularly focused on the outlet side? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The answer is I could, in fact I have a list here of them, I could take up the rest of the call with the names, but because David always makes fun of me when I rattle off names, I'll be very limited. But things to bear in mind with our outlet business, we have some of the greatest outlet centers in the world. So literally we're getting international designer tenants that are opening their first, second or third outlet store in the world at our properties. But we're having the more people that are in bulk; ASICS, Citizen, Scotch & Soda, (44:10) I could go on and on, I literally have a paper in front of me of probably 150 names, and one of the reasons it's so strong is because the occupancy has been so high, this is the first time we've had even a little inventory that we can accommodate all the people that want to grow. So it is just not an issue whatsoever with demand. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. And I think an important point is that the value oriented, I mean, you can get discounted goods a lot of places and it certainly proliferated, but to the consumer having them all together in a nice pretty coherent layout is why consumers will travel to our outlet centers and shop and I will tell you this. The comp NOI growth in our outlet business exceeded the mall business, okay. So, I've heard this chatter, I don't know where it's coming from but I'm here to officially refute it. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning. You and your retail peers don't report same-store revenue and expense growth, just NOI. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on those two pieces of revenue versus expenses? How they've been trending? It seems like some of your NOI growth maybe more attributable to the expense savings side versus revenue growth? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's incorrect. You see our P&L. You can analyze it. That I thought that's your job. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Then on the same-store NOI, you guys did have a strong first quarter which is above your full-year guidance of 3%. So, I was just wondering, if we should expect a slowdown later in the year or if you're more just sticking to the previously laid-out guidance of 3%? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think I already answered that question a couple of times. And we've affirmed our guidance, that's really all that I need to answer on that front. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Then just last one on the development pipeline, mall redevelopments and the grand of (46:46) outlets have been a traditional good growth drivers? So I was just wondering what your outlook is for new outlet supply and to what extent also separate from your (46:57) JV, you might be able to be proactive with some of your Sears stores? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, on the outlet side, we've got a very interesting pipe. I think in Asia, we've got a very interesting pipe with McArthurGlen. We're hopeful to start a new project in Spain here in the next couple of months and I think the investment community should realize, we have a really strong business outside of the U.S. and it's worth much more than what it's on our books, okay? But, put that aside. So, there is a nice pipe through McArthurGlen. And by the way, we just open a new center in Provence, which is \u2013 which we own 90% of and that's no small feat to accomplish in France, and we have our partner McArthurGlen to thank for that. We have a very nice pipe in Asia, very nice pipe in France. We will have one project that we'll probably start construction in the next couple of months in the U.S., which we'll announce shortly. And then, we've got a couple of more that are in the works that will probably won't start till 2017 \u2013 I'm sorry, 2018 for 2019 delivery. So, we continue to look for opportunities on this \u2013 there is nothing more than what we do is plan for potential department store redevelopments. And we're working both on sourcing the demand and then ultimately, trying to get the boxes back and that's an ongoing process that will continue to be. But we think that will be beneficial to the company in the long run. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Someone has to go back to that CapEx question. And you have a lot of great information on your supplemental. But one thing that isn't very clear is how much CapEx, quarter-to-quarter you're having to payout to get that 3% or 3.8% same-store NOI or those leasing spreads? So, I was curious, how has that trended over time, and he (49:27) was talking about retailers investment in their stores, but are you incrementally having to find that maybe you help \u2013 you have to help them out with that part of process? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, this is Rick. Frankly, though the thing I think you're probably referring to is our tenant allowances and if you look, they've been relatively consistent over a very long period of time, we give virtually no allowance on our renewals. We tell you the allowances that we do on a per square foot basis for our new leases and happily this quarter it happened to be a little higher, because we're able to do a lot of great leasing for some very high impact tenants, and so it's a little more allowance, but as David has said consistently all that is built into our NOI growth, and it is consistent with where we've been over a long period of time. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So nothing on the margin, that's changing at all? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, I mean, it moves from quarter-to-quarter, but no, we don't \u2013 we \u2013 here's you got to put companies in \u2013 you got to think a little bit broad, Kim. There if we were loosey-goosey with our capital, we wouldn't have the best balance sheet in the business with the most fire power. So we don't buy upper end, we don't throw capital after tenants that may fail, that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes but we \u2013 there is just no change in our approach to that, and it will never change, and that's why see these things are related, right. That's why you have \u2013 that's why we have the balance sheet here as because, you're right, it is all about capital allocation. It is all about not putting good money in the rabbit hole. And we are not perfect there. We make mistakes. We do take chances every once in a while. But there's just no trend there, it's just not what we do as a company and I'm \u2013 would have hoped that seeing us operate for this long period of time, you would understand that. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And just a second question, going back to your comments about technology. From a consumer standpoint, when I go into a \u2013 you might not like this, but when I go into a Westfield mall or a Simon mall, I think, from a consumers perspective, it doesn't \u2013 you can't really tell a difference, right? And why I say that because, some of the technology improvements you're trying to make, at the end of the day, do you think the mall companies have to be more collaborative to really make a big change? And what they're offering at the malls? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, first of all, I view that as a complement. I think, Westfield is a very good operator. So, that's number one. Number two is, look, we do \u2013 it is potential, we could collaborate. We do that currently for instance Deliv is a consortium of three or four mall owners. We talk to \u2013 the mall owners talk on technology front all the time. We talk to Westfield, we talk to General Growth, we talk to Macerich, Taubman, et cetera. When there's a new product that we think and that we can \u2013 because at the end of the day, we really don't compete all that much locally. I mean, if you are really fascinating about our businesses, yeah, we have skirmishers here and there. But we don't have a lot of overlap with our top operatives in markets of all that significance. So, there is the potential to collaborate, we're more than happy to. And I do think there is potential to do that and we have done it, and there'll certainly be more potential as we move forward. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask questions. It seems like the bankruptcies that have been filed so far have come fairly late in the quarter. So, I just curious, if you had relative to the 120 basis points or 130 basis points quarter-over-quarter decline in the ending occupancy, do you have a sense of what the average occupancy was for the first quarter? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. Okay. Is it fair to say that there would be some lingering impact from what's already happened now in the second quarter? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I mean, yeah, I mean we can, again we'll look at it. It's just not, we're not obsess with it, okay. We'll look at it and maybe Tom will give you the number, maybe he won't, I don't know, okay. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then earlier, you had mentioned that the department stores are a big opportunity that you're looking at. And just curious in the near term, you got three anchor expiries, I think they're all \u2013 just looking at the average size, looks like department stores. Curious, if there's an opportunity with those three or how those discussions are going? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Basically, those were all subject to option. So we expect them to be exercised. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then last question. Just in terms of the comments you've made today and in the past about retailers investing in their stores more maybe than the omni-channel or the e-commerce side of their businesses, can you just maybe share a little bit, I know we've asked this question in the past too, but just in terms A\u00e9ropostale in-store investments, some of what you're doing on that front? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, they did a clean up to restart the brand during when it went from the liquidator to the new owners. It wasn't really material, but it was a good beginning to reintroduce the brand to the consumer. And centrally most of the stores were touched, some more than others. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I guess, are there further plans for other in-store investments that sort of improve the... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think that's probably not this year, but we'll \u2013 we evaluate it all the time, we're not afraid to invest in it, but it's \u2013 to go through bankruptcy is somewhat traumatic, okay. So, and again, we weren't in-charge of liquidating it in the periods. So, again, I don't want to get into all the technicalities of it, but we just took it over January, I don't know, 1 or 2 or 6, whatever the date was. So, this year is just to stabilize it, we did clean up to reintroduce it. We are sourcing new product. We are going through all that, but it's the first year. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. So, first question, can you share what the average price of the stock you repurchased during the first quarter was? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It will be in our Q. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: But I think it was around $1.74. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Okay. We've seen you do a few non-retail developments to some of your top urban properties. The hotel at Phipps Plaza, hotel in Luxury Tower at Galleria. So, I guess my question is, what's your appetite for more of these office apartment or hotel type of projects. What role do you envision in playing in platform going forward and can you give us a broad sense of what type of returns you look for? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we're going to do returns that create value for our shareholders, that's number one. Number two, I don't think we'll do much office frankly other than we have built office on top of the few of our new developments like at Domain and Clearfork, just to name a few. We think that's nice mix, but I don't think \u2013 I sell the land or do something probably before I built an office tower and I think we have a very nice pipeline for hotels and multi-family throughout the portfolio. We're talking to a lot of people. We got some great plans and I think that will be a growth vehicle for the company going forward. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: So it sounds like you are bringing some partners for that. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, yes and no, we might. We'll certainly bring in operators, but we could bring another developers that just \u2013 it depends on the market and there is \u2013 again there is no one set answer, but the reality is we could do both and we have done both. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. One if you more on readout please. So, first, can you talk about the lease up and early feel for some of your recent readouts and expansions like at Roosevelt Field, Del Amo, King of Prussia. I know, it's a bit early in some of these cases and you have a strong track record. But I'm wondering how pleased are you with the early read and trends from these projects and have your return expectations changed at all versus your underwriting? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Not really. I mean, the \u2013 it always takes time to lease up new expanded space. Most good developments do not have a 100% lease to start, you always kind of want to calibrate or you want to wait for the retailer. I'd say we're pretty much on plan on those. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then, your upcoming projects, Norfolk, some of the others any change in readout expectations there \u2013 return expectations? Are we still thinking similarly 7%, 8%? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Norfolk will do better than that. But now it's all in our 8-K and you can see nothing really changed, in terms of our returns. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the 2017 leasing plan and how far through you are? And also, on the development and redevelopment spend front, are you still expecting about $1 billion a year in 2017 and 2018? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes, on $1 billion a year. And Rick, you want to... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. On the renewals in 2017, we're probably about 10 basis \u2013 100 basis points ahead of where we were last year at this time and we're already starting on 2018. And we're probably about 20% due our 2018 renewals, which is ahead of where we were in 2017 this time last year. So, we're very focused on that and making good progress against it. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. That was it. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Good morning. On the income... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : On the income statement, the income from unconsolidated entities, it was down compared to last year, what were the moving parts on that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's primarily that's where you see the A\u00e9ro... Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: ...losses. Good question, though. Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Loved the French earlier, David, though I think the pronunciation could do some work. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Among other things... Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I can't talk... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I can barely speak English (61:43) French Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Few questions. I guess, just first I was curious, I mean, earlier this month, David Contis announced his plans to leave, I was just curious how his departure affected succession planning for leadership roles at Simon, does that cause you to rethink some things? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, I mean, David left for family reason. Yes, there is no impact on succession planning there. And it gives \u2013 we have a great strength in our bench and our development team; Kathy Shields, John Phipps, we just hired a real quality veteran that was in Luxottica running that real estate, Mike Nevins. So we have a very good bench and so really not much to say beyond that. So no worries on that front. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And maybe for Rick, I recognize maybe it's early for some of those, but in situations where you guys have ether had anchor closures or even a competing mall in the market that you compete with has closed, do you guys have any harder anecdotal data and I guess I would call the sales transfer that you might have ticked up either the other anchors in the same mall or your mall relative to a close competing mall, I'm just curious how that shift might have happened because usually retail sales aren't destroyed, they sort of move elsewhere. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Anecdotally, what we have heard from our department stores is that they do gain market share both when they close their stores in the market and frankly that was the point that David alluded to earlier when he said in the long run, this retail consolidation is going to benefit us because those sales that are in the market, we're going to get our share of them. Also, we have heard from our department stores that when a store closes in the mall, those shoppers for the most part stay in the mall and those sales do get redistributed among the other department stores that are in the property. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The most interesting thing on that front is that when they \u2013 if they do close a store or they leave a market, those Internet sales that are in that market go bye-bye. So that's really the \u2013 just to broaden your question in terms of the answer, I mean that's what's interesting when they leave a market, those Internet sales in that market tend to go bye-bye. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And what's your take on concept of grocers returning to the mall. One of your competitors has paid a little bit of lip service to that and I'm just curious what do you guys that think about that dynamics since it's been frankly a very long time since the mall industry has had grocers, I think I last saw them in like The Blues Brothers movie or something? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, you hit like anything else. There is certainly opportunities and when there are opportunities, we take advantage of them. We added Wegmans in Montgomery Mall. We've added Fresh Market in The Falls. We're literally in a process of adding a supermarket right now at College Mall where we demolished the Sears. So where it fits the market, there's certainly a great use. You got to be able to accommodate their physical constraints and it also has to make sense economically, but we're actively talking to them. And hopefully we'll have others that are going to find their way into our properties as we get space available. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's a good move and we'll certainly pursue it. So, we think it's interesting and we have done in the past, we'll continue to do it. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just a last question, maybe a little involved, as it relates to occupancy costs, the last several years Apple has been and other retailers have been early pronounced influence on mall sales. Some people have estimated that adding an Apple to the mall or a Tesla, for example, can boost overall sales on average about $100 a square foot. But that 10%, 15%, 20% increase in mall sales sort of implies that the typical in-line retailers' occupancy costs might actually be 15% to 20% higher than the mall average that we can kind of see. And I guess my concern is just, is it that the occupancy cost where a typical retailer might be at a big premium, but at a time when their margins are under a lot of pressure, I guess, the question here is, do you really think occupancy costs in the next few years can continue to hold steady or do you think we're doing to see some need for them to roll down just because maybe they've risen to a point where it's just very difficult for them to afford it, given where there profits are? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think it's a retailer-by-retailer case. That's certainly the case for some retailers without question. So, it's a case-by-case. So one thing I would \u2013 with respect to your question, remember our sales, we have all the outlets in it. So the dramatic impact is from a highly productive tenant is not that \u2013 it's not dramatic, okay. That's not to say though. There aren't \u2013 certainly, there are some retailers that \u2013 because their productivity is so low that they have too high \u2013 they can't afford the rent, that's what makes our business. That's what's moved our number is that those guys go out and we find somebody else to replace them. If we could not replace retailers, then it would be an issue, but we can and we have to, and that's what we do. In Europe as another example, I mean, the occupancy cost there are much greater for in line tenants, yet they have all find the ability to become more profitable. So, again, I think certainly that's the case for some retailers. When that happens, we tend to replace some and again when you think about the impact on some of those higher productivity tenants, just put in less than perspective because we meld in the outlet business, so that doesn't make it as \u2013 not that it doesn't have an impact, but it's not dramatic. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. No worries. Operator : And our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Your line is open. Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. I just want to go back to the redevelopment issue, in particular when you're redeveloping an anchor box. Can you give us some of the math behind your 7% target return? For example, is there a good rule of thumb on the cost to reposition, the space on a per square foot basis? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There is really no rule of thumb, every one of these development opportunities is evaluated on its own and the returns are going to be a function of how you redeploy the space. If it's all small shops, the returns could be considerably higher. If you're substituting a single user into the existing box, the returns could be a little bit lower, but the capital expenditure will be lower. It's a case-by-case situation and frankly, as you can see, when you look at our reporting, we've been very active in bringing anchors to our property and that's been going on for years. And it's going to hopefully only accelerate as we get control of more of the space. Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. I guess, if you're replacing an anchor with like Dick's for example. I mean, is there a \u2013 on a per square foot build, is it $200 a foot, is it $300 a foot, I mean any perspective you can give us on that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. We don't go into the specifics. I mean, that's something we disclose our capital in our schedules, but we're not going to go into the specifics of an individual redevelopment project. Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. I guess, the reason I ask is because there is obviously a lot of questions about where are rents going, where is occupancy going, I think one of the other concerns from investors is the amount of capital going to malls and how much of it is really a return on investment or rather just maintenance capital and so? Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Look, I encourage those inventors to look at our financial statements, okay? I mean, that's what instead of the rhetoric, instead of the narrative, just look at our financial statements, okay? Look at our return on equity. I don't know what else to tell you then. I know you're trying to get ahead of a trend. But I mean we disclosed a tremendous amount of information. And I would just encourage you to look at our financial statements. Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Appreciate it. Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, David. Just had a quick question about A\u00e9ropostale and sort of going back to the operating losses. Appreciate why 1Q is seasonally a low income quarter. But just thinking about A\u00e9ropostale specifically, the last time they publically reported, it looks like they posted operating losses in every quarter with first quarter and second quarter obviously being the worst. So, just in terms of modeling purposes, so wondering if you could maybe give any sort of frame of reference for how much the operating losses compare to 2015? And if we should think about that $0.03 as consistent for 2Q and then coming back down, how should we think about that from a modeling purpose? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, we don't give quarterly guidance, number one. We think that's a waste of everybody's intellectual curiosity. There's just no way to compare it to 2015 and 2016 because the fleet was the 1,000 stores and now it's 500. We've done a dramatic job on sourcing, we've done a dramatic job on overhead. And again, we're just building the inventory back up because of the liquidation. So it's really an apple and an orange. And the reality is, just to put in perspective, $0.03 on $2.74 is what percent is that? Somebody do it, 1%. So it's not like it is what it is in our cash investment between OpCo and IPCo was in the $33 million. So again, let's just put all of this stuff in perspective. And again, it will probably continue to have generally \u2013 it will probably continue to have operating losses through the \u2013 until the fourth quarter, but I'm not going to give you per share stuff, because we just don't do that \u2013 per quarter stuff, I should say. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good. Got it. And I wasn't looking for you to give guidance, I appreciate you don't give quarterly guidance. I was just looking for some frame of reference that... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I... Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: ...operating loss is 50%. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Rich, I know you're smart, but you can't go back to 2015 and 2016, because that company is completely different then it is today. So... Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, exactly. And that was sort of the \u2013 I guess, the point of my question, is it 50% of the losses that it was in 2015 or not. But okay... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well \u2013 and fact of the matter is, we're not \u2013 I don't even look at 2015 or 2016, I am looking at what they're doing going forward. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. My pleasure, my pleasure. Operator : And our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking my call. Maybe to alleviate some of the fears here in terms of the store closures that have occurred since the 4Q call. Can you just give us a sense of a percentage of ABR those stores would represent collectively in your portfolio? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The \u2013 let me \u2013 I don't understand it. Can you restate the question, please? Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. In terms of the store closures that have occurred since the 4Q call, the incremental ones, what percentage of ABR does that represent in your portfolio? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's not how we would look at it, so what percent of the average base rent would we \u2013 I don't \u2013 the answer is I don't know. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Something like annualized rent. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We put in \u2013 look, the way we look at it is, we've got our total revenues for our properties, not our share, but our total is over $6 billion, right? So, it's very \u2013 it's immaterial when you look at it on that perspective. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then you've touched on this topic already, but maybe just to ask a little differently. When an anchor goes dark, what's your thought process that goes on to decide the best and highest use of that space? To the extent that you're getting these anchors back faster and sooner than you expected, are you thinking about these redevelopments differently in aggregate, maybe from a merchandizing perspective than when they were fewer happening across the retail landscape? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we're always thinking about things differently, I would say. In this case, the reality is, we don't have any empty boxes, okay? Now, I guess King of Prussia is going to be empty and that will be our one and only empty box. And I guess, it's fair to say that we are thinking about that a little bit differently and that given the dramatic changes that the malls had in that particular area of the wing, with Sears going out and Primark and DICK's taking that over. And the interest in mixed use, we'll probably go more mixed use, more big box, and since we added all the small shops connecting the two malls, yeah, you could say maybe, our thinking is different, but I would tell you that I \u2013 hopefully it evolves every day, so maybe on the margin. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: But I would also say to you that we are analyzing virtually every box that we have and we keep a running strategic assessment of who is not in each of our properties that would be appropriate to be added to that property including the other mixed use potential because it's a market specific analysis. So we are anticipating potential opportunities to recover these boxes, and so we are not going to be caught flat-footed when the opportunity present themselves. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood: Great. Thanks, guys. I have a question. And David, this sort of relates to your comments about your private equity friends employing leverage. What are your plans for your Hudson Bay joint venture? And what do you \u2013 how do you see that business evolving? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I don't know \u2013 Floris, I don't know why you would relate those two. I mean, those are \u2013 those guys are real operators, and I think they're going to \u2013 they're evolving to be best-in-breed, so in that, in the department store area. So look, I think that we've got so much optionality with that joint venture, it's \u2013 right now, it's business as usual, but those optionality to take it to another level is as the landscape changes, but right now, it's business as usual. We're looking at selective boxes to redevelop within the existing portfolio. They continue to improve upon their fleet putting money back into the physical real estate and I continue to be impressed with how they operate through stores. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood: Okay. And then a question, I guess, on the \u2013 your international properties, just \u2013 I know you talked, your leasing spreads you usually cite are for the U.S., but I am just curious with the 99.8% occupancy in your international portfolio, what kind of leasing spreads are you getting there, are you really able to push rent? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes, very much so. A lot of it's new. So we don't have a lot of rollover yet, but the answer is yes. It's a good question. Again, we kind of look at the cash flow growth, but maybe there is some numbers there that we can get to you next time. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood: Great. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from David Harris from Uniplan (79:38). Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. Good morning. So I am 20 years plus working on my American, but hopefully you can understand my question, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Only too loudly and clearly, okay? We understand everything you say. Unknown Speaker : Okay. So yesterday, the administration put forward plans to reduce the corporate taxes down to 15%. Now, this is not a new idea and who knows whether that ends up at that number. It does look though there is a move to lower corporate taxes. I mean, if you can give any thought to a level at which it might make sense to become a C-Corp. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Again, a very good question. I thought you're going to bring out the game yesterday. Tottenham, my \u2013 and we're on a good streak until yesterday. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. I know. Well, yeah, I think you'll make it, so that's an aside. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: All right. So I \u2013 you sounded a little depressed on the call, but anyway it's a good question. The reality is, it's worthy, doubted we would change. But let's see what the number is and \u2013 I mean we do have a lot of depreciation in our business. So... Unknown Speaker : But that might go away. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I don't think so. I mean \u2013 what I understand is bonus depreciation is part of the thing to go back and forth. I mean there is no reason to model it right now, because you know God knows what's going to happen. But it's interesting our taxable income is $7 thereabouts. So at 15% without accelerating depreciation, I'm not sure why I would suddenly want to pay that to Uncle Sam. But if they change something with the depreciation rules, maybe it's of interest. But I would rather give that 15% \u2013 I'd rather give that money to our shareholders as opposed to the government. Unknown Speaker : No, I mean, I guess the flexibility that would come from being a C-Corp would be a potential in setting aside what rate it is... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I agree other than you know we do have taxable income of $7. So, which again, if our FFO per share is $11.50, the mid-range, $7 that's not too shabby. Unknown Speaker : Right. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: ...so, maybe they'd have to change the depreciation rules to really get us to think about it, I think. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Good luck for the rest of the season. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Bye. Operator : And we have a question from Christy McElroy from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. It's Michael Bilerman again. David, I'm curious you've talked a lot about the narrative in the negative rhetoric that's out there in the popular press. I'm curious if you've opened \u2013 if you had an open invite to these journalists to come to something like King of Prussia or Del Amo or Aventura where, I don't know if they can find a parking spot at 2 o'clock in the Saturday, but bring them to those assets? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I don't know. I mean, I'd rather bring my shareholders there. So I mean, I think some have tried to paint the other side of the picture and it just doesn't seem to be working. So I'd rather \u2013 I think our folk \u2013 I'd rather bring shareholders wherever they like to go, we're happy to tour them, explain the business, we certainly do it with sell-side and so on. We're certainly \u2013 we communicate all the time with our investors and shareholders. I think that time better spent and time is better spent running our business than trying to get the narrative change, it just \u2013 I'm only expressing that point of view to try to anybody that's concerned about the narratives, see \u2013 that's on this call, at least sees the other side of the story, that's all I'm interested and expressing on this call. And importantly, that's evidenced by our numbers, but I'd rather spend more time with our shareholders and our teams, they're just \u2013 I just don't see as being successful and changing it right now. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: One of the things you talked about in your shareholders' letter, was it, we have too much retail per capita in the U.S. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Some of it becomes obsolete. I know we have little exposure to this industry will feel the pain and this feeds the overall narrative? I guess what is your expectation of retail that needs to come out? I mean, is there any \u2013 is that shifting at all? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's interesting. Look, I can't sit here and predict what per capita we should have. That's way above my ability to forecast or even have an opinion on. I will tell you this. Certain malls are actually that maybe shouldn't have been built or maybe in the right trade area or actually \u2013 they last a lot longer than people think. And so, I don't know, I have no idea. All I worry about is what our portfolio can produce in terms of cash flow and I don't really have an opinion on kind of what the right U.S. numbers should be. I just don't have an opinion. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right. David, thanks for the time. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. All right. Thanks. Sorry, this ran a little longer and appreciate all your questions. We do like giving everybody a chance if interested to ask your question, and given there's no more, we can go on through the rest of our day. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We had a very productive quarter and are pleased with our impressive financial results. We started, completed and opened several significant new development and redevelopment projects that will further enhance our portfolio. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, extending our average term and reducing our weighted average interest cost. And most importantly, we continue to achieve impressive operating and financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.47 per share, which included a $0.36 charge for the early redemption of our 5.65% notes. On a comparable basis, excluding the debt charge, FFO per share was $2.83 and increased 7.6% year-over-year. We continue to report solid operating metrics and grow our cash flow. Our mall and premium outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.2%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to occupancy at the end of the first quarter. Tenant bankruptcies processed during the second quarter for retailers including, but not limited to, Rue 21, Payless, BCBG and BB impacted our occupancy by approximately 100 basis points. Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $52.10, up 3.3% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand. And for our locations, the malls and the premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.13 per square foot, which was an increase of 12.9%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and outlets was $618 compared to $607 in the prior-year period, an increase of 1.8%. And for those of you interested in how our international centers are performing, we reported retailer sales were up across the portfolio. Total portfolio NOI increased 5% or more than $70 million for the second quarter and more than $150 million year-to-date comp NOI increased 4.4% for the quarter. And as a reminder, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI. On an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows. Reported retailer sales on an NOI-weighted basis was $770. Average base minimum rent was $68. Leasing spreads would have been 14.1%. These metrics demonstrate the health of our portfolio. The type of operating metrics and returns I mentioned are the result of disciplined investments and focus on our operations. At the end of the second quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing in 25 properties across all three of our platforms, with our share of net cost at approximately $1 billion. We completed the Galleria in Houston in the second quarter and opened up the former Saks space for a small shop, tenants and restaurants. Construction continues on several major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive projects, including La Plaza, The Shops at Riverside, Aventura, Allen Premium Outlets. We expect most of these to open within the next 12 months. On new development, we had another busy quarter, opening four new outlets, three international; Provence, France; Siheung, Seoul, South Korea; Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia; and, of course, we love the U.S., one in Northbrook, Virginia. Construction continues in our mixed-use development in Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, which will open in the fall of this year. We also commenced construction on a new premium outlet center on the north side of Denver, scheduled to open in September of 2018. Kl\u00e9pierre, as you know, reported strong financial results last week. They are positioned well to continue to capitalize on the strength in the Europe, improving economic conditions and increasing consumer spending. Now, quickly on the balance sheet. Another active quarter. We completed a dual-tranche senior offering, a total of $1.35 billion with a weighted average coupon of just over 3% and weighted average term of 7.8 years. We completed the two early redemptions of our senior notes totaling $1.85 billion. And during the quarter, we closed six mortgage loans totaling $1.1 billion, of which our share is $573 million with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.5% and a term of 8 years. And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 billion shares of common stock for $244 million. Our current liquidity is more than $6.5 billion. We also increased our dividend for this quarter to $1.80 per share, a year-over-year increase of 9.1% and a 3% increase from the second quarter of 2017. We will pay at least $7.10 for the year of 2017, which is an increase of 9% compared to last year of $6.50 last year. So, we also raised our guidance to a range of $11.14 to $11.22 of FFO per share. This \u2013 the midpoint of this range is an increase of $0.04 from our prior-year guidance after giving effect to the charge relating to the debt extinguishment of $0.36. Finally, to conclude, while we don't like to promote, we would like to remind those investors who are interested, we produced yet another quarter of impressive results and operating metrics. There is no company in our industry that has our breadth and quality real estate is as diversified by type of retail real estate and as active in the mixed-use development of real estate and has built and operated successfully in Europe and Asia, has consistently increased earnings cash flow and dividends, has the access to capital with an A-rated balance sheet or as innovative in terms of operations, including connecting with the consumer in deal making from retail to entertainment to venture capital or various corporate transactions like we have. We're now ready for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Given the re-leasing you're doing in the face of this challenging retail market, are you starting to decrease your exposure to apparel? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. Rick? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Let me just give you a couple of metrics. Literally, our apparel now is down to the low-40% as an allocation of our GLA. More importantly, when you look at our new deals over the years, (09:52) we're literally having almost 20% less in terms of allocated to the apparel and shoes and food services, allocated is going up substantially. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And the new tenants coming in, are they able to match or even perhaps beat the rents that the exiting apparel guys are paying? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Absolutely. As you see in our spreads and our average base rent increases, we're able to continue to drive our growth in rents. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Now, I would just add, Craig, the list of new tenants is as interesting as we've seen in quite some time. If you would like, Rick is absolutely prepared and, in fact, excited... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Enthusiastic. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: To give you the list. However, that's entirely up to you. But I... Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I would love to hear the list. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. I will tell you that it \u2013 from restaurants to new retail concepts, to e-commerce, to street, to malls, there's a lot going on. Now, Rick, without further ado, without further ado, please, please list off some of the ones that we're talking to and in fact doing some business with. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And these are all tenants that we have in fact executed leases with and are opening stores in both our mall portfolio and our premium outlet portfolio. In the mall, UNTUCKit, Eloquii, b8ta, Peloton, Juice Generation, thredUP, Tommy John, Indochino, Flying Tiger, Calzedonia, Muji, Deavaley (11:34) Rituals. And these are from international, and Shinola, Nespresso. We've got \u2013 and frankly, I could keep going for another 15. On the premium side, we literally have Dockers, Cody, Basler, Hackett, Havaianas, Hickey Freeman, Karl Lagerfeld, Schua, (11:55) Lafayette 148, Marmo... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I told you, once you get him started, it may never... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And frankly, I could go on for another 30 names. The important message is, these properties are vibrant, there is a lot of demand and we're able to execute leases that are growing our rents. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And just one last thing for me. Just maybe some commentary on the Mills, the leasing spread of up 24.9% what's driving that? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We frankly have done a very good job of bringing over to the Mills both our full-price mall tenants and our premium outlet tenants. So, the Mills now encompasses value retailers, full-price retailers, off-price retailers and they're very vibrant environments. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. The sales there have done very well. We've added a lot of restaurants. It's just been a very good, solid business for us. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: David, I think your prior same-store NOI growth forecast was 3%. You've now trended well above that in the first half, so it would indicate a deceleration in the second half. Has that forecast changed at all, given the year-to-date performance above that level and in the context of the current retail environment? And to what extent did maybe expense controls contribute to that pace? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well. Christy, we don't \u2013 our industry gives out a lot of information, as you know, lot of operating metrics. We have always taken the position where we don't update our comp NOI. Obviously, if we didn't feel like we could hit the number that we give at the beginning of the year, we would tell you. But we don't update it every quarter. We have \u2013 we're not going to get into that issue, but we're always trying to outperform the guidance that we give to you and we'll see how it goes. We are \u2013 have a little more volatility maybe than some other folks because of our overage rent given our tourism properties, and that's trending in the right direction. We love the dollar weakening. But we got a year to operate, and we'll see where the number is. The most important thing is, if we felt like we weren't going to hit the number that we told you from the start, we would tell you. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, just given all of the list of retailers, there appears to be a lot of still demand for space. How are you thinking about in this environment with more store closings, but in the context that there is still demand? How are you thinking about \u2013 in your conversations with retailers around store closings versus providing rent relief, how are you thinking about rent relief versus just letting those stores close? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, I think if I could take a step back and just talk about the company in a sense, I mean, we \u2013 Rick and I are like, I mean, we're \u2013 I hate to say it, but we're like really experienced in tougher times, okay? We actually do our best work in tougher times. I think a lot of that is because we have the judgment of when to fish or cut bait, when to help a person restructure, when not. A lot of these are judgment calls. But as you know, I mean, we have always more or less outperformed when all boats aren't rising with the tide. So, that's what we do. I will tell you it's not a very fun environment. We're working extra hard. We're pounding the pavement more than ever. We got to go get deals. We got to figure out. We got to restructure some. We got to do all that. It all goes into a blender. We'll use the best judgment we can. And hopefully, we make the right decision. Some of which we do a lot of times. But sometimes, we make the wrong decisions. We operate historically. And we can go through chapter and verse, but we operate historically when things are a little bit rocky at the very best of our industry, and that's what we're all about. So, there's no set answer. Every situation is case by case. I'd rather it we weren't dealing with this environment but we are, so we just deal with it head on, do the best we can. But I think we'll be leading the charge within our own industry. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe a follow-up question on that and tying it into (17:06) results. I was just curious if you guys are using more short-term leases at this point in the cycle. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think that basically is a case by case basis. In this kind of environment, you do tend to do a little bit shorter-term deals because you are betting that the market or the environment will get better, but I wouldn't call it dramatically different. Less than 1% of what maybe our volume is in that category. But again, these are judgment calls. It makes all the sense in the world, frankly, in a lot of cases to do short-term deals, if you feel like the environment's going to get better. I know, in my own personal view, I could be wrong. But I do think that our environment is going to get better. But that's just my instinct. I would not necessarily bank on it but \u2013 so, in that case, I think doing short-term deals makes \u2013 it could make sense. But a lot of that is also \u2013 the thing about us is that we make the \u2013 unbelievably, given the size of portfolio, but we make decisions space by space, mall by mall, retailer by retailer. We put it. And so, every \u2013 we just don't \u2013 it's just not like, okay, you stamp it out. It's every deal is a little bit different, and that's where our judgment historically has at least allowed us to do okay in the tough environment. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, maybe going back to an earlier comment that you made out liking the softening dollar as it relates to tourism. I was just curious if you could comment on what, if any, benefit that had on 2Q FFO results, as well as the updated outlook. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think it stabilized some of our tourism properties. But it hasn't had what I'd call \u2013 I haven't really seen it big time yet. But we had a real benefit. We've been \u2013 I mean, we've been, as you know, for the last two years we have, as remarkable as our growth has been and industry leading. We have had an Achilles heel of a strong dollar and a reduction in tourism spend. So, again, you have to put that in perspective. I know we're a little bit bigger company. I know we all want to get granular to the last detail. I assure you, we do run that way. We have a lot of moving parts, and we've been suffering from that. And if we get to the point of stabilization and, in fact, an increase in tourism spend, I think, that's really good for us. But I think it's too early to call that yet. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : I was just curious. Obviously, you guys had a very strong comp NOI number in the quarter. And I'm just curious. The occupancy decline that you incurred sequentially, was that mostly kind of an end-of-period sort of occupancy decline, or did that occupancy hit kind of happens throughout the quarter and that quarterly run rate is a bit more of a normalized number? Should we look for a little bit of a step-down in the Q3? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, a step-down in occupancy or comp NOI... Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : A step-down in the kind of run rate of NOI going from Q2 into Q3. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We don't \u2013 as I said to you earlier, we gave you our view of what our comp NOI will be at the beginning of the year. We do not update it quarterly. I don't think we should ever get in that business. I think, when you look at our business, you got to look a little bit long term not quarter-by-quarter. If for some reason we felt like we weren't going to hit what we told you at the beginning of the year, obviously, we would tell you that. We're not in that position. And the reality is that the occupancy dropped because, as I said in my prepared remarks, we flushed through various bankruptcies. We still have more to do and we \u2013 some of these things are negotiated as we speak. As an example, you've got Gymboree, which is in bankruptcy. We're negotiating now. Those things have deltas. The good news about our company is the size, the different avenues of growth, the different levels of real estate, the different product type, the international exposure, the way \u2013 the other step that we're going on and we'll be able to manage that, and we're \u2013 we haven't backed off our comp NOI. But we do not, Steve, do it by quarter. I'm sorry to inform you that. But as you know, that's been our \u2013 as far as I know, I don't think we'll update our guidance every quarter, but there's a lot that goes in that, but we don't update comp NOI guidance. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : That's fine, David. I wasn't looking for an updated number. I was just trying to get a sense as to where the occupancy fell and when the shortfall kind of came. It was end of quarter, beginning of quarter, but we'll... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, I really don't know. But I'd say \u2013 and Steve Broadwater is here. He's telling me throughout the quarter. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay? Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. And I guess, maybe a question for you or Rick. When you just sort of look at kind of your watch list, and we've obviously had a lot of tenants that have either restructured leases or filed for bankruptcy, how would you sort of characterize kind of the length of the watch list in terms of stores today versus maybe six months and a year ago? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, I mean, there are still others out there. But we're dealing with what I'd call the material, bigger accounts now as we speak. So, I'm not ready to call it my Ben Crenshaw moment. I don't know if you play golf. Do you play golf, Steve? Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : I do. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. So, remember, Ben Crenshaw at the Ryder Cup, when the U.S. was down and they had that feeling, I'm not ready to call it my Ben Crenshaw moment. But what we're dealing with some of these troubled guys. I would \u2013 it's very interesting. A publication just wrote about kind of the biggest problem in that area. As you know, I wrote about it in my shareholder letter in 2015 that I saw the handwriting on the wall from some of these leveraged retailers, can't have too much leverage in any business frankly, let alone the retail business. You're talking to a guy that has done workouts in the early 1990s. Rick is a workout guy, too. We're \u2013 I think we're getting through most of it, but there are still some out there that may or may not hitch. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. The only other point I would make and it's really lost in a lot of the dialog by the by Payless, Rue, Gymboree are all restructuring, all of those lenders are converting their debt to equity and they're going to emerge with very substantial retailers with much better balance sheet. You compare that in 2009 where the REIT creditors did not have the confidence in the sector, and they were taking a liquidation bid instead of restructuring and that seems to be missed in all of the other conversation out there. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And I guess, just last question. As you guys think about kind of future redevelopment opportunities, has anything really changed in terms of kind of the taste or the ability to get some of the newer, larger redevelopments kind of underway at this point? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Not really. I mean, obviously, the big potential pipe that we're \u2013 will happen is the big department store recapture. We're being very methodical about it. We are being very focused on paying the right price for the real estate. We're also very focused on how we manage it internally in terms of resources. But that pipeline will be big. It will be material. It will be beneficial to our real estate, but we're going to be reasonably methodical about it. Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks. That's it for me. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey. Good morning out there. So, two questions. The first one is, in thinking about Ascena and other brands like that, how often are you guys surprised about which retailers either declare bankruptcy or which \u2013 or if a retailer just wants to close stores, which stores they actually close? Do you guys find that you generally have a pretty good read on it, or do the retailers sometimes surprise you? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I don't want to comment about any one particular retailer. But generally, if a retailer is in bankruptcy, obviously, that gives them flexibility to basically cancel the lease. We kind of know. I mean, it's not \u2013 it's \u2013 sometimes, we're surprised. Obviously, there's a lot of games of chicken played. They hire workout guys that are meaner and tougher than Rick. We have stare downs. But you more or less know, in bankruptcy, kind of what's going to shake out. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then, the second question is, in last quarter's earnings calls, your \u2013 one of the bigger peers said they want to explore options. Obviously, if nothing happens, how do we interpret that as anything other than sort of not good for retail outlook or mall value? So, if nothing happens, do we say like, hey, retail is actually going to get a lot tougher or malls aren't worth what we think they are? Or is there a way to think of it in a different way? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I'm not really going to answer that question, okay? So, that's \u2013 we're very focused on what we're doing. I'm not going to really get into that debate, Alex. I'm sorry. And we're \u2013 that question is better addressed not to us. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. I appreciate that, David. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: On your same-store NOI growth rate of 4.4% in 2Q, I think this was stronger than the market was expecting, which is encouraging, especially considering GDP growth was maybe 2%. But people often talk about differences by quality. And it seems, just looking at the results and what you guys quoted versus other retail peers, that portfolio mix including property type is becoming important. So, I was just wondering if you could discuss to what extent you see levels of strength vary by mall versus outlets versus mills or if it's by region or help us otherwise try to understand what could be differentiating the Simon portfolio. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I do think property type plays a role into that, for sure. I mean, there's no question about that. But I also think the depth and breadth of the organization plays a role in that as well. And I think we're an important vendor to a lot of retailers because we have good real estate where they make money and we do a lot of things to improve the portfolio. We're doing a lot of stuff on the marketing front to drive traffic. We're here to help our retailers with all sorts of programs. I'm always somewhat surprised on the ones that do participate and others that don't. We can help drive traffic to their store. But I think it's just part of \u2013 we've \u2013 I would say we've pretty much outperformed year-over-year. I'm looking at Steve and Tom. They can give you the numbers. But we pretty much always had really leading comp NOI growth, so it doesn't surprise me that we're leaving the pack again this year, including the strip center guys. We're \u2013 we've outperformed them as well. So, I don't know. I just \u2013 it's just something that we take pride in. There is no guarantee that we'll continue to do that. But it's \u2013 that's what we've done historically in terms of strip centers, malls, retail or whatever. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, along those lines, again, the 2Q result was pretty impressive. I was wondering though, if you look at your income statement, and I totally get that this is consolidated and it doesn't include JVs, revenues rose 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter and expenses were up 2.9%. And when you get outside of malls, other sectors regularly break out same-store NOI between revenue and expense. So, I was just wondering if you could give any color on how the two lines, revenues and expenses, would look for Simon. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I mean, the \u2013 I think part of the issue is that we've consolidated some assets with our European outlet business. So, you're seeing a little bit of that in terms of the revenue growth. Now, on the other hand, expenses there, they don't operate probably at quite the margin we do. But there is no \u2013 we are such a size (32:12) that there's just nothing that you're going to point to that's that out of the ordinary. And we try to run very efficiently. I mean, we kind of knew, as you know, what we did on the corporate G&A front. We knew this was going to be a tough year. Rick and I and a few other executives are taking some reductions in comp. We just think it's a right thing to do in this environment. So \u2013 but the one thing that we will not do is run these properties so that they are not \u2013 we think of our real estate as hotels. And that's not to say we perform this. But if we \u2013 we have to have a good product, and the product has to feel good to the consumer, and we're not skipping on that side as well. But you had some movement... Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We had some movement in these numbers from what's consolidated and what's in the JV and some portfolio movement which my guess is more of the answer to your question than anything else. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just last one. Would you say, on NOI, it's fair to think that margin is continuing to expand? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We're focused on it. We're not miracle workers. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about your views on usage of CapEx to close on deals and, more in particular, if there is any noticeable trend in the CapEx you're using for new rental value that's on a percentage basis, if there is any noticeable trends going forward? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: This is Rick. There is absolutely none. If you go back over the years, our TA per foot has been in a very tight range, and it remains in that range for this quarter. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, okay. It's hard to kind of account for the timing of when you spend the CapEx which is why I asked that question. And... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Did you \u2013 I think you broke up there. Could you restate what you just said? I'm sorry. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I just said sometimes it's hard to triangulate and to account for the timing when you spend the CapEx versus when you're doing lease \u2013 doing new leases. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well \u2013 but again, CapEx is \u2013 yeah. We show you our tenant allowance number, okay? CapEx is basically associated with redevelopments in the portfolio or new developments. So just want you to understand it kind of \u2013 if it's a tenant allowance, that shows up as outlined in our 8-K, okay? Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And second question. In 2016, you guys capitalized internal leasing costs of about $49 million, still a very efficient number compared to the size of your company. But just going forward, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the new accounting rules that are coming out that might require you to expense most of that. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we're going to follow GAAP. So, it is what it is. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, do you actually have an estimate of that $49 million? Is most of that going to be expensed or a portion? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Not at this \u2013 when it comes into force in 2019. In 2019, we'll give you that number. But we don't at this point. But I'm sure our number will be comparable to anybody else's. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Good morning. On the store openings that you talked about, Rick, at least, when you look at where some of the newer concepts are going, some of the e-commerce retailers and others, it seems a little concentrated in the kind of A-plus malls and outlet centers. And I'm wondering, as you have discussions with some of these chains as they're rolling out the first 20 or 30 stores, I mean, how do you think the pool of malls is ultimately going to be for these concepts, if they're successful? I mean, do you get conversations starting where they see themselves as potentially having 200 stores or 250 stores, or is it maybe going to be more limited than that? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, in fact, as we talk to them, it's not unusual for them, when they're opening their first store or their second store, they're going to want to do it in properties that they have the highest confidence in. But I will tell you that when you look at the e-tailers as a class, there are now over 280 stores in the United States from the pure play e-tailers that are opening stores and you go through in UNTUCKit, Warby, Bonobos, Blue Nile, Eloquii, Fabletics are all raising incremental rounds of capital that is dedicated to opening stores. So it's going to be a process, but I believe they have all recognized that having a well-positioned fleet of stores is certainly necessary and optimal for them to grow their business. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Do you think we'll see kind of this next wave \u2013 I mean, obviously, they're raising capital for this. But in your conversations with them, they're planning for sort of a deeper wave of growth within the mall space. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We've seen it. So, for example, Eloquii opened their first store. They're now opening three more with us. Blue Nile opened their first store with us. They're opening four more with us. It's going to take time, but it's absolutely happening. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think \u2013 look, I think, Paul, here's what I would say too, and Rick said it but let me just say it as well. The retailers always will tend to go, as Rick said, to the no-brainers early on. But then they realize the profitability they make and then they will grow. Depending on what kind of retailer they are, that could be 400 stores, 200 stores, 50 stores, 20 stores. The news that's important is that, in this cluttered world of trying to get people focused, we are seeing more and more brands that want to gravitate toward where traffic is, and traffic continues to be in a number of centers. And I do think, from the e-commerce folks, there is \u2013 not all, but there is a limit to attracting eyeballs online that they can't get in the physical world. Now, I mean, malls are getting a bad rap, but the reality is we see it in media, we see it in the entertainment world, we see it on the food side, we see it with the theaters, they \u2013 we see it with the fitness guys like at Life Time. They all want to congregate in the best location and where the traffic is and by and large in communities throughout the country, that's the mall. And that has not changed. So, I know the narrative might be a little bit different and I know, obviously, retail is under more pressure than it has been in the past, but I have my own theory on that, which I've explained to you in a few shareholder letters. But that's the good news here. Now, that doesn't mean that there's \u2013 you have to cycle some of the poor performers out with some of the better ones. And by the way, we've been doing this for quite some time. We all remember Woolworths or W.T. Grant or Steve Roth is on the phone doing his thing, Corvettes. I mean, you go down the list, Caldor. I mean, that's just the way it works. But between media, virtual reality folks, they want to be where the traffic is and where people want to hang out and that's by and large the kind of stuff that our industry has. Please don't lose sight of that. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. My other question is just on the buyback, you continued to exercise it in the quarter. And when it came up last quarter, it seemed like you were suggesting that it is something that we should view as an ongoing kind of part of your business, at least on a leverage-neutral basis. Is there any update to that? Is it something that maybe people should think of as just, when they look at their models, something that should be incorporated on an ongoing basis? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I still think it's in our arsenal to give back capital to shareholders. Obviously, we're more focused on our dividend growth because that is testament to the cash flow that we generate from our properties. And as you know, I mean, we're going to have at least a 9.1% increase this year, which, my favorite guy, I've quoted Ben Crenshaw, now I'll move to Adam Sandler, that ain't too shabby. Okay? Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Right, all right. Great. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Hi. I was wondering, are the batch of newer tenants on the shop side that you've been leasing space to over the past couple years, are they taking the same-size stores as a lot of the legacy retailers that they've replaced? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Totally a function of the retailer. Some of them want a larger format like Muji. Some of them want smaller formats like Eloquii. And frankly, our job, and we've talked about this in other calls is to basically be able to manufacture space. And in our great properties, getting back space just enables us to drive our NOI by bringing in more tenants and raising revenue and raising productivity. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess on the restructuring side, I think a few tenants were mentioned. I know you don't want to talk about specific tenants. But generally speaking, when you see a restructuring and these tenants come out and they're in a better financial position, are they typically doing something different on the operating side too to drive sales or it's just better overhead, better ability to pay rent. I mean, what have you generally seen over the past few years? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think the biggest issue is they don't have any debt. So, they can \u2013 I mean, without the debt, they can invest in their business. And it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You have too much debt, you obviously have to service that debt. So, how do you service that debt? You reduce your investment in the stores or your investment in technology, you reduce the inventory in the store, right, because you can't afford to have the inventory in the store and you reduce the service. You put it all together and it is self-fulfilling, without question. And unfortunately, we've seen that. And so, the most important thing is, when they are restructured, they have \u2013 they now have the cash flow to do those three things, hopefully invest in the store, hopefully invest in more inventory, hopefully invest in better service and, to some extent, technology. So, that's the model. And unfortunately, we've seen it go in different direction. But we're hopeful that, as Rick said, we're seeing some of these folks restructure. We're here to help them within reason to do that. But it's not our fault that they're in the spot they're in. And let's not lose sight of that. We are, on the other hand, been investing in our product, we've been investing in our services, we've been investing in our marketing. We have not run from our responsibility to make these physical asset better and to communicate with the consumer directly to get them excited about seeing what we have to offer in our \u2013 in the physical world. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That was it. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to drill down into the numbers a little bit. It looks like you had a nice rebound in Aero this quarter, maybe $15.2 million versus the $5 million headwind last quarter. How should we think about that going forward? And, David, I know you mentioned some seasonality with Aero last quarter. Is that $15 million how we should be thinking about that going forward? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: You have to look at Aero \u2013 yeah. You can't really look at Aero quarterly. But you got \u2013 for us, we look at it annually. And obviously, the first quarter was a huge transition, a big loss which I don't think the market understood. That's why we might have been off a couple of cents or $0.02 or $0.03 in consensus. That's very normal for a retailer to have their losses early on and then start to make it back up. So, what we're seeing in Aero is exactly what we thought we would see, but we don't give quarterly guidance. I will tell you this, though. They had a \u2013 I mean \u2013 knock on wood, I mean, we're seeing very good progress at Aero and we're still comfortable with how we modeled Aero in our numbers. Our increase in guidance has nothing to do with Aero. So, we're still got in the totality of the Aero results the way we saw it at the beginning of the year. But they had a good second quarter and back-to-school is percolating. Lot of work to do there, but this is a brand that had $900 million of sales and it's got a core constituency and we think it's going to be okay. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, maybe just one more question for me. It looks like cash NOI was up. Straight-line rents were down. Could you maybe walk us through the moving parts and how those two buckets work with each other and how we should be thinking about that going forward? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The straight-line reduction was a function of the \u2013 if we have any straight-line receivables on our books and somebody cancels a lease through bankruptcy, we have to write it off that quarter. And that's why you saw a pretty significant decrease... Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So, not like \u2013 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, no, no. It's \u2013 basically, the vast majority of that is essentially the write-offs of the bankruptcies that we may have had on our balance sheet. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. So, not like free rent burn-off that was being put into the same-store NOI pool or anything like that, primarily bankruptcies? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, sir. All primarily the bankruptcies. We got to write off that receivable right when the lease is rejected. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Or they go into bankruptcy. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And then, one other quick question. It looks like interest expense went up. Is that because the buybacks went on the line of credit, or am I speaking about that correctly? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well. Yeah, I mean, it's debt in our cash flow. So, we're not necessarily borrowing... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Just to do our buyback, we have enough cash flow to do it out of our cash flow. So, I just... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, I just \u2013 nothing major there other than we did \u2013 I think we did have a write-off on our old revolver that may have gone through the second quarter because you got some of that on the balance sheet. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We have the redemption every 30 days. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, the redemption, which we had an extra 30 days. And then, we also have the consolidation of the certain MG assets as well. So, nothing unusual there other than a couple of consolidations and the extra time on our \u2013 extra 30 days on our redemption. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. That's it for me, guys. Thank you for the additional color. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure, no problem. Operating: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, folks. David, just given your comments on the unhealthy relationship between debt and retailing, as a derivative I guess on that business, what do you feel is the right level of debt for a retail real estate owner? And has that changed in the past year or two? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, for a real estate owner, look, I think \u2013 look, I like the spot we're in, especially if there is more volatility in the capital markets. I think we all have to be careful with too much leverage in any industry or in any business. I live through it. Rick live through it, which is good for our shareholders to know that we've got a few spurs on our boots, right? Spurs on our boots, right? That's not on our results, right? It's on our boots. But I don't want to give you specific numbers. I think every company needs to come to their own metric. We're kind of disciplined. And then, the A rating, we want to maintain that. But I think every businesses \u2013 everybody should come to their conclusion. I would hate to give you a number that's right for the industry. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And how do you think about the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon? I know it's not one of your tenants. I guess, I'm wondering, do you think Amazon or maybe another group entirely could target a mall anchor? There is no shortage of them, considering that frankly the enterprise value of some of these publicly-traded mall anchors are really a fraction of the consideration that's been paid for Whole Foods, particularly when you look at it on a per square foot basis? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I have a lot of interesting thoughts on it, but I will provide none of them on the record. But I do think it's \u2013 the good news for us, as an industry, it does reinforce that, in my opinion, the importance of connecting with the consumer through a physical business. But beyond that, I really \u2013 I mean, we really don't \u2013 I really don't want to comment on that. I mean, I have a lot of opinions. But I just kind of share them with my board and some of the guys here. But I don't really want to get into that. It's not \u2013 they're just my opinions, and who knows if they're right or wrong. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Maybe just one last question for Rick. I guess, sort of, a two-part or \u2013 as far as it relates to leasing, can you talk about any themes, particularly geographic themes, to new leasing activity or volume of leasing activity of late? And on the renewal side, I'm just curious if you see any change in the rent growth or concessions compared to the past few quarters. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: On the renewal side, the answer is no. Again, if you look at what we reported, I think it shows pretty steady, consistent progress where we were last year in connection with our renewals for 2018. So, there is nothing there. In terms of geographic, not really. We have obviously a very strong and focused effort to get local tenants involved in our properties, and I think we're doing a good job with that. But there's no regional, geographic trend that would drive the leasing activity. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Look, and I think entrepreneurialism is back. Lots of people want to start up a business. We're seeing explosion in the food area. We've obviously seen explosion in the fitness and wellness area, cosmetic area. So, all of that, we've seen it in the mixed-use area. So, I think that's all good. The stuff does take time. You do have downtime. But in that sense, we're excited about having the ability to broaden our mix, which I think is very important for us to do. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Just back to an earlier comment. Why do you think the environment is going to get better? What do you see in the broader market or maybe within your portfolio that gives you the confidence? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I said I'm not ready to declare that, okay? But I'm starting to think about it, and we'll see. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, what's your view on dispositions right now. Would you be interested in selling any of your Non-A Malls? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we always think about selling some assets here and there, and we'll continue that. But we're not \u2013 we've never believed to sell assets just to sell assets, we got to get the right price. We go through a very detailed analysis to do that. And if we feel like we're \u2013 we'll get a fair price, we'll sell some, what I'll call, non-core assets. But we're not under pressure to do it, and we'll continue to cull the portfolio though. Okay? Thank you. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Question, could you talk a little bit about your views on the retail outlook, kind of, U.S. versus Europe versus Asia on how that could influence some capital allocation decisions over the next few years? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, listen, I \u2013 the great thing about real estate is it's so unique that we've operated in three major areas and we could get caught up in the macro viewpoint of a country or a \u2013 where capital is flowing. But at the end of the day, it's all about location and supply and demand. So, let's take Japan as an example. Japan, from an overall macroeconomic environment, you would think to yourself, boy, the retail is going to be terrible, okay? But yet, we've got great properties, we got a great product, we have a great partner and we've been kicking tail for each and every year in Japan. So, we look at it. We really \u2013 and obviously, you want to be careful about where you allocate capital if you don't have \u2013 if you have a concern generally about the country and property rights and stuff like that. But we've avoided those kind of countries. And I would say, right now, we feel good about our Asian business. We opened up in Kuala Lumpur with Genting. It's off to a great start. We just opened in Provence, France. It's off to a great start. Another one in Seoul. So, I think we can still make money selectively. It's important to know macro trends. But at the end of the day, it's all about the local business because I kind of learned that just watching the Japan scenario play out for us. But at the end of the day, we feel really good about kind of how we've allocated where we are. We can be opportunistic outside of the U.S. But our core focus will continue and always will be the U.S. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Sure. Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, a question for you on your JV with Seritage. Curious if you're thinking about perhaps making more investments on that front, buying out your partner in some of the existing boxes and maybe incrementally investing in more. Saw one of your peers recently do so. I'm curious what your thinking is here. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think what \u2013 that deal was good for both companies, good for Seritage, good for General Growth. And there is possibility win-win intersects between us and Seritage and Sears for the foreseeable future, and we will try to create that environment and I'm sure they will as well. But there's no guarantee. Anything could happen, but we're always looking to create win-wins for our partners, Seritage being one of them and Sears indirectly in that they're in a lot of our real estate. So, a deal like that made sense for both of those parties. It certainly is possible as we think about things, but it's got to be a win for us as well and, obviously, for the counterparty. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got you. Okay. And then, I want to go back and get some incremental thoughts on leasing spreads. Last year, I think it was third quarter, you and GGP, I believe, first noted the impact of leasing spreads. I believe it drove your spreads down almost 400 bps sequentially. So, I'm just curious here, now, that you've had a couple quarters of 13% spreads following the 10% in 4Q last year, should we be thinking of spreads in this low-double digit range near term? And then, also, just want to confirm that the impact of these amendments are included in same-store NOI but not in spreads. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. If it's \u2013 we define it in our \u2013 if there's a lease that's longer than a year, it's in the \u2013 all amendments are in there, okay? And that's defined in our 8-K exactly how we do it. We don't make \u2013 we don't give guidance on rent spreads. We give guidance on \u2013 we don't give guidance on occupancy necessarily. We kind of give you a flavor for it. We don't give guidance on tenant sales. We give guidance on FFO. We give guidance on our comp NOI. And I'm not going to make predictions of rent spreads. I will tell you that they were down from a couple years ago primarily because of the general retail environment and, obviously, some of the tenant restructurings we've been dealing with, and we'll see how it shakes out. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, I have a question for you. You guys clearly are executing better than some of your peers. Does that make you think about your ability to add value to other portfolios? And maybe can you give some comments broadly on how you're thinking about possible M&A, especially if there are changes to boards, et cetera? Does that make you change your big game hunting theory? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, as I said to you, I'm out of the big deal business. And I really haven't changed that point of view. If somebody wants to call and talk to me, I'm certainly going to take that call. But I think, Floris, it's \u2013 I wouldn't overreact to one person's quarter here or there that we're outperforming. I will say, over a long period of time, we've tended to have really good comp NOI growth within our \u2013 if you want to call us a mall company, we've been at the top of that, and we certainly have outperformed the strip center guys over the same period of time. Some of that is a function of what I said at the end of those marks, but it's really not fair for me to like comment on other people's numbers. And I wouldn't react to other folks with one quarter here or one quarter there. Real estate is a long-term business. You got to invest in the product. I think we all make too much out of one quarter here or one quarter there. All these guys are good operators or they wouldn't be here today. And I think you just have to give the benefit of the doubt to people in our industry. It's easy \u2013 I think \u2013 well, I don't want to go there, but the fact is it's \u2013 no one should overreact to one quarter or another. I think everybody's doing the best they can do. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Okay. One other \u2013 thanks for that, David. One other question. As we look at the mall sector, clearly, everybody's trading at big discounts. In your opinion, where do you think is the greater mispricing? Is it in the B malls or is it in the A malls? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, I think our industry certainly compared to other industry is being mispriced and I'll leave it at that. I think you can be a successful B mall operator. I don't think you're going to zero. I will tell you that without question. I think a lot of these what people want to call B malls, if they're in the right town and that town is stable and they're a good operator and they're focused and less worried about trying to please Wall Street but more interested in pleasing the community, they can do fine. Their growth may not be as robust as the ones with what I'll call \"A\" properties, but they can do fine. They may never be able to satisfy Wall Street and the institutional investor wanting kind of real estate that you could put on an annual cover, but they can do fine. But it's got to be focused on the community first, what they can do for the community and then the rest can follow. But look, having well-located real estate gives you a lot of opportunities to change it up over time and to make it better, which is what a lot of us have been doing for decades, not 5 years, 10 years, not 20 years, not 30 years, but 50 years, 60 years, Talban (01:06:28) 50, 60 years; Simon, 50 years, 60 years; General Growth, 50 years, 60 years; CBL, 50 \u2013 40 years, I don't know. I mean, that's a testament to those guys and a testament to their product, and we shouldn't lose sight of that. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Great. Maybe one last question on HBS. Any sort of comment based on the sort of the latest news coming from there or strategic plans with your stake in that company? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: How \u2013 guess how I will answer that. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: No comments? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The answer is, I have no comment on that. Our joint venture continues to do exactly what we thought it was. HBC has been a great partner. I've got all the confidence in the world in that team. Richard Baker is a very creative guy, but it's \u2013 we're not a shareholder of HBC. So, it's just not \u2013 it's not \u2013 there's nothing I can comment on that activity. Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.: Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Thanks for taking the follow-up. David, I wanted to take your comment about the sector being mispriced from a public stock perspective. I'm curious in your conversations with institutional investors either your \u2013 some of your current joint venture partners or prospective partners, how they are thinking about the business both from your non-core potential asset sales or stakes in some of your high-quality assets and how those conversations are going and trying to navigate that mismatch. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we don't like selling stakes in malls. Obviously, you do it if you need the financial flexibility. But we've always looked at bringing in partners, if there's a new opportunity and we want to manage our balance sheet. That's the way we've looked at it so \u2013 but, Michael, institutional investors aren't always right. I mean, so, sometimes, they buy it. I'll never forget. I had one of the biggest and best sovereign wealth funds. I begged them to help me buy General Growth when they were in bankruptcy, and that was an 8.5 (01:09:20) cap rate, and this was before all the histrionics on the recap and all that stuff. But just \u2013 let's go buy it together, and the guy wanted a 9.5. (01:09:30) And I mean, so, they're not always right. I don't really have a comment on it. We're really not that active looking for institutional investors. Now, if we had a new deal to do something, I think we'd find the capital, but we haven't been really out looking for it. I think, on the B mall, the mall activity is starting to percolate. There's probably more people thinking about it a little bit more and somebody, I believe, in rolling up the \u2013 what is perceived as the downtrodden, whether that is the reason it's debatable. But what is perceived as a downtrodden, it's going to make money. It may not be appropriate for a public company \u2013 for public companies. But somebody is going to buy a lot of this stuff with cash flows and make a few bucks. Rick and I may \u2013 maybe we're going to start a new company so... Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: If we think about \u2013 if I make an analogy Q2 back in 2009, and I guess to go back to that time, but you did pretty big solid for the industry, right? You issued debt and equity and allowed the REIT market, capital markets to reopen. Isn't there some sort of analogy of being able to sell some interest in high-quality assets at remarkable cap rates to sort of prove evidence in some ways about where the stocks are trading. And I don't know if whether you agree with that or not. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think that's the silliest idea in the world. Honestly, why would I want to sell an A asset to make a print for you to be comfortable with and then you say, oh, it's great. But then, oh, but that's only the top of the portfolio. Or you have to sell B assets now, and C assets and E assets and D assets, it's a short lived \u2013 we don't think about like that. We think about operating our business, how to make it better for the consumer, how to market better, how to lease it better, how to redevelop better, not financial engineering that will be short-lived and have no impact. Why would I want to give up growth rate \u2013 a growth rate of an A asset? So, you will say, well, that's great. But what about the rest of your portfolio? It just makes no sense to me. We don't need to now. I understand if you need to because you need the financial flexibility. But as evidenced our ability to raise $1.350 billion in three hours, thankfully, we're not in that spot. That's just not what we do. But like I said, if there was a deal that we felt was good, I think we could raise institutional capital if we wanted to. Maybe we don't. We don't need to. I just \u2013 I am \u2013 I just don't understand that logic. It is short-lived. I mean, others have done that and they got a one-day pop. And now, they've lost the growth. Now, look, they did it because maybe there is too much exposure of one mall and I get \u2013 and maybe they needed the capital for other things. So, there are reasons to do it. But to do it just to print so it makes the NAV investors happy, I don't know. Forget it. It ain't happening. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's why I asked the question to get your perspective on it. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I hope I gave it to you. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Your answer was very clear. Last one... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: You may disagree with it. But at least, it's clear, right? Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Well, okay. Your point is, if you needed the capital, you would do it otherwise, as there's no reason to put up a print on the screen, which I understand. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: The last one. Just the overall environment with a lot of the headlines, the news media, even your retailer, public retailer conference calls. And I would say some operators and I know you said don't look at one quarter, but not all of the mall brethren operate at the same level you do or able to strike the same type of deals that you can and being able to stay ahead of the trends. That's why you are you and they are they. But how do you not let that whole perspective negatively impact the environment and become the self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think we all have to be careful about that, right? So, I think the retail community has been overly negative on the mall product. I don't know why they do it, but we're just going to get up off the mat, keep doing what we do. So, I'm not \u2013 this isn't sugar coating. We're in a tough environment, but we've seen it before, yeah. Could this be different this time around? Yeah. But I don't necessarily \u2013 I don't buy that equation, okay? That's not how we're operating our business. Do you need to be \u2013 maybe a touch more conservative? Do you have to hoard a touch more capital? Do you have to be a little more flexible with retailers? Of course. But I \u2013 but we don't see the end of our business. I think Rick told me he went to the ICSC meeting, and it was kind of all the negativity and I heard it from like four people. What did you say exactly, Rick? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I basically said we had a board meeting and it was a close vote, so we decided to stay in business. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: So, I do think the narrative is a little more negative. I think a lot of that is facilitated by investors making the other side of our bet. It's interesting. It's like I have a lot of points of view on certain transactions out there. We have never really seen that before. It's very interesting to see how that side of the world operates, but where we're \u2013 we got to deal with it. So, look we after this meeting Rick and I are going to be spending six hours approving capital projects to make our properties better, and that's how we're thinking about the business. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Well, I appreciate you sticking on to take the questions. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. No worries. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to David Simon for closing remarks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Have a great rest of the summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day.",

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. The last couple of months obviously have been challenging as the country has endured the devastating impacts of natural disasters and tragedies, which have impacted millions of people across the country including many of our Simon employees and their families. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all affected. There has been significant disruption from Texas to Florida, Puerto Rico and California. And due to the dedication and heroic efforts of our field team members, thankfully, all of our personnel got through these events. Across all of our platforms, we closed 45 of our centers for combined 412 days due to natural disasters including the one that occurred in May at Colorado Mills due to a hailstorm. All of our centers in Texas and Florida had been back to normal. Our centers in Northern California now back to normal, operations as well after the horrific wildfires there. And we expect Colorado Mills, which has been closed since May to open in time for the holidays. Our two centers in Puerto Rico are currently not open and we are in the process of making repairs where possible. We expect full restoration of these centers to take some time given the damage to Puerto Rico's infrastructure and availability of building materials. We are fully insured for this event including business interruption insurance. We currently expect the closure of Puerto Rico centers to impact our FFO by approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and this reduction is currently included in our guidance. I couldn't be more proud of the Simon team who have demonstrated courage, resilience, perseverance and how they professionally responded to these unprecedented events. Now, let's talk about the third quarter. We had another very productive quarter and are very pleased with our financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.89 per share, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. For the nine months ended, our comparable FFO per share growth was 6% which, without question, will be at the high end of our peer group. We continue to report solid operating metrics and cash flow growth. Our malls and outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.3%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the second quarter. Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $52.42, up 3.3% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand and pricing power for our locations, the malls and outlets. Re-leasing spreads of $7.21 per square foot, an increase of 11.2%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for the malls and outlets was $622 compared to $604 in the prior-year period, which is an increase of 3%. Total portfolio increased 4.8% year-to-date or $212 million and 3.9% for the third quarter. Comp NOI has increased 3.6% year-to-date and 2.5% for the third quarter. I remind everybody, once again, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI disclosure. Also as a point of reference, our third quarter growth is typically less than the growth rate we achieved for the first half of the year if you are interested in that and have a desire to look historically. Now on an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows : reported retailer sales on NOI-weighted basis would be $776 per foot compared to $622 per foot; average base rent would be $68.54 compared to $52.42; leasing spreads would increase 17% compared to 11.2%. And these weighted metrics, again, reinforce the quality of our assets, and they're not to be ignored. At the end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion were ongoing at 31 properties across all three of our platforms. During the quarter, we opened a significant expansion in Allen Premium Outlets in North Texas. We have a significant opportunity to continue to improve our portfolio through the densification of our centers with the addition of mixed-use components, hotels, multifamily, office, and others, and included in our supplement this quarter, you'll begin to see that list of activity. We have a number of projects under way. We'll continue to add different uses to our centers where we see the opportunity to generate accretive returns. Construction continues on several major redevelopments and expansions, including The Shops at Riverside, Aventura Mall, Toronto Premium Outlets, just to name a few, and we expect these, again, to open over the next 12 months. We recently opened The Shops at Clearfork, great new center. This open-air center is an excellent example of the type of vibrant mixed-use, community-centric environment we create, along with our partners. We have carefully curated a mix of shopping, dining, entertainment, office. And The Shops at Clearfork will be the dynamic hub of a timeless asset in the terrific city of Fort Worth, Texas. Construction continues on two new outlet centers, both in really good markets, Edmonton, Canada and north side of Denver, Colorado, which will open in the spring and fall of 2018, respectively. Our share of redevelopment activities continues to approximate $1 billion. Simple update on capital markets. During the first nine months of this year, we closed on 12 mortgage loans totaling $ 2 billion : our share of that is $1.4 billion; weighted average interest of 3.12%; term of 6.8 years. Our current liquidity is $6.5 billion. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. We have the highest investment-grade credit rating in the industry, more than five times interest coverage, and I again reinforce our financial flexibility is a real advantage that cannot be but continues to be overlooked. Today, we announced the dividend of $1.85 per share for the quarter. That's a year-over-year increase of 12.1%. We will pay $7.15 per share in 2017, which is an increase of 10%, and look out for 2018, which will be higher. We are updating our guidance range to $11.17 to $11.22 of FFO per share. That is the highest in the REIT industry. This is an increase of $0.03 on the low end of the range compared to our prior guidance, even with the $0.03 reduction for the quarter I mentioned previously due to the closure of our two Puerto Rican assets. So, finally, as you can see from our results this morning, we produced yet another quarter of impressive results and metrics. We continue to invest in our product and generate the kinds of returns that will continue to grow our earnings, cash flow and dividends. We're now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning out there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: This is not that far out there. We're in the Midwest. It's not like we're way out there, okay? Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Well, that would be... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There is activity for all of those investors, west of the Hudson. I just wanted to point people, I want you to point that out. Alex, what can I answer for you? Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Well, thank you for that. So two questions. First, just in Puerto Rico, can you just tell us sort of a breakout number of tenants who are paying, or said differently, the number of tenants who aren't paying? And then on the business interruption insurance, maybe for there or elsewhere, what the impact is and if we should expect anything into next year or if the $0.03 is really just in the fourth quarter this year and next year we shouldn't expect any impact? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I'll give it to you, really very high level. So, we've taken a deductible. We had a deductible expense that went through the P&L in the third quarter for Florida and Puerto Rico. After that deductible, we're fully insured. In the fourth quarter, there is nobody paying rent at this point. We don't collect business insurance until all of that is resolved. And they won't begin to pay rent until we restore the building. And I wish I could give you a sense of that, but it's really going to depend on the next couple of months because there is a lot going on down there and power needs to be restored permanently. And as I said, we're doing our repairs and restoration work concurrently, but it's going to take some time to get it going. So, that $0.03 is what we expect. That would have been essentially our net operating income for those two properties in the fourth quarter. It could drag into 2018. However, if it does, we would expect some of that eventually to be recouped through the BI, but we can't book the BI until it's actually cash collected. And so, when we do our earnings and 2018 guidance, we'll have a better idea of exactly the impact. Again, I'm more focused on the tragedy at Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, if you extrapolated the $0.03, that's less than 1% of our business. So, it's obviously immaterial. But we're more interested in what's going on there. If you take out our redemption here, you know that we earn well over $11.50. So if we're at $0.11 or so, that's basically less than 1%. Even you, Alex, can do that math, right? Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yes, although I do have a colleague for backup if need be. Then the second question is, in the other income breakout, the lease settlement income jumped and then marketable securities gains. Could you could just provide a bit more color? And then on that lease settlement, was any of that from Teavana, or is that still outstanding? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: None of that is from Teavana and there's been a little bit more lease settlement income this year. Again, that's not in our comp NOI. As you know, we did own Seritage stock. We did sell that. And I would only point out for those of you that \u2013 I would hope most people would study our P&L without making statements, is that we also had more than offsetting what I'd call unusual expense on the expense line, all of that you can see in our 8-K, in our P&L. So I think like this is all washes. If anything, it's a little bit more negative, but that's up for you guys to determine. And we outperformed even with the deductibles, even with the extraordinary expenses that we incurred that were higher than what I'd call the higher than normal lease settlement income, and obviously the Seritage marketable securities gain. It's a gain by the way, not a loss. Let's keep that in mind too. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Thanks, David. Operator : And our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David or Rick, can you just talk about occupancy in terms of the trajectory as we move into the fourth quarter and into next year? And right now in the third quarter, you're sitting about 100 bps over last year, which was a record high. You got to 96.8 bps by the fourth quarter, you're at 96.3 bps in the third quarter. How should we think about the trajectory into the fourth quarter relative to that spread, and how does that line up as we move into next year from an occupancy perspective? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We should have improvement in the fourth quarter. That's number one. We're not going to give you a number. Number two is we give you guidance in 2018 in February, but the reality is the only reason why it's down is we've had some extra bankruptcies this year. We had a bunch in 2015. We had less in 2016. We had a bunch in 2017. The portfolio is in excellent shape. So, we'll continue to improve upon that. And we've done more leasing this year. I don't have the exact number. Rick might have the total number. But we've leased a lot of space this year, what, over... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: 7 million square feet. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, it's more than that, but the point is \u2013 and we're dealing \u2013 the issue with bankruptcies is you're at the whim of the court. So you have a lease, they can cancel it at a moment's notice, and it does take time to lease. But we've leased over 10 million square feet this year. That's a lot of leasing and we'll continue and improve. And like I said, I think we'll have an uptick in the fourth quarter. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. I was wondering whether that year-over-year spread is going to continue to widen. So you've gone from 40 basis points, 70 basis points to 100 basis points relative to last year given some of the bankruptcies. How we should think about how the fourth quarter is shaping up, whether that 100 basis points stays flat or whether it narrows as people start to take the space? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We had a lot of bankruptcies go through the third quarter. You can't lease space in a month or two. It's certainly harder to lease space to open up for the fourth quarter once you get that space back in the third quarter because you have build-out and so on. But like I said, we have an uptick, and it's essentially all on the margin the way I look at it. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then second question in terms of capital, and you talked about how strong the balance sheet is and how much liquidity. I noticed that you didn't buy back any shares in the third quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit about why that was the case and how that differed relative to what you did in the first half? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The simple answer to that is we've got \u2013 we're very close to some significant redevelopments that we're excited about, and we are very conservative. So we're creating a pile of financial power that we want to take advantage of, and we've got a little bit more redevelopment that you'll see in the next, I don't know, month or two. That's really exciting for the portfolio, and we figured we might as well hoard some cash. And actually, we also love raising the dividend. I love raising the dividend 10% a year. I really like that. So between the redevelopment, raising the dividend, having a balance sheet that cannot be compromised, with significant firepower, I know it's all ignored right now, but I don't ignore it, and I'm going to rely on my judgment that that's stuff that I shouldn't ignore. So I know no one wants to pay attention to it. I know nobody cares. But raising that dividend 8%, 10%, 12% a year, having a hoard of cash to put back in the portfolio of accretive returns is really exciting, and having a balance sheet tried, tested, ready to go to work is really a competitive advantage that I really like, and that's what we're going to do. So this dividend is going up, the earnings are going up, the balance sheet is going to get stronger. That's the model we got. That's what we're doing. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, all right. Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. I noticed on the development activity report that the Edmonton project is listed under Mills. I wondered if this indicates a different leasing approach that maybe is broader in value scope than just outlets? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It will be. It's always been designed as Mills. Our partner there actually owns The Mills in Toronto and in Vancouver. And this has always been organized as a Mills. It's enclosed. It's what I'd say bigger in size. So it's always been kind of \u2013 we consider it more Mills like with the boxes and the outlet and the entertainment uses. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: So our partner is the owner of Vaughan Mills and the one that they've just opened in Vancouver as well. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, that's encouraging. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then it seems like you may be taking a change in direction on the new redevelopments, maybe more densification, or is that something that I just need to wait the next couple of months for? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think we've got a terrific portfolio set to do. So, the answer is yes, Craig. I think you'll see more and more stuff from us along those lines. Obviously, we're not going to do it just to do it. The idea is to increase the value of the portfolio. But Rick and I went over plans yesterday at King of Prussia. King of Prussia is basically a $2 billion asset. We had a Penney that just didn't fit there with Neiman and the Nordstrom and the Lord & Taylor and the Bloomingdale's at all. You know the center very well. It's very big. We didn't need another department store. They've closed their store there. We could have done traditional, but the fact of the matter is the pivot of what's the front and what's the back of that center has evolved over time. And we have the ability for a hotel, apartments, office, and complementary retail with outdoor work and play space. That's going to be unbelievable for that community and, listen, we've got to do it. We got to get it done. We've got to open it. But I think that a lot of folks are missing those kind of opportunities and are kind of \u2013 you cannot, one thing you cannot do is replicate the real estate that we have and that's unique unbelievable opportunity. It's going to be a significant investment. It will be our Hudson Yards version for suburban, but wealthy King of Prussia. It's a great market. It's a growing market. That's what having good real estate is all about and it's underappreciated, but I get it. We've got do it. We've got to prove it. But if you've seen some of the mixed-use stuff that we've done over the past few years, you've seen that our core competency is increasing in this area. So again, we will devote capital to those kind of projects that are very exciting and we'll take that $2 billion asset to, I don't know, $3 billion, $3 billion plus, why not, right? Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sounds good. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Hi. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Hi. Just a couple of quick things, David. One, I think you mentioned that you did have a deductable hit in the third quarter, but I don't think you quantified it. Could you give us that number? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: $2 million. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's $1 million per occurrence. The flood in \u2013 Harvey and all the flooding did not reach the deductible expense. We had other expenses, but not up to that number. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks. And then I also noticed on that other income page and expense page, professional service fees were up quite significantly, and I also noticed that the regional and home costs were down. I just don't know if you can provide any commentary around the large jump from professional fees in the quarter? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's mostly associated with legal expenses. As you know, we had this situation with Woodbury. You know our point of view in terms of how we felt about that, but they were significant, significant expenses. That, to me, is a one-time expense. And then obviously we're going to be \u2013 we're running our business as efficiently. We have the highest margins in the business. We've got the best overhead percent of revenue in the business. We take pride in that, that we have the highest margins. We take pride that we have the lowest overhead, again something that's underappreciated, and we'll continue to do that. We did not have an LTIP for the senior dudes because we knew this year would be a little bit tough. It's actually coming out better than we thought. We're hitting every number. We've got best growth in the industry. We've got the best balance sheet. Our operating metrics are \u2013 sales were up. All of that is pretty good. But you know what? We thought it might be a little tough. And so we tightened the screws, and that's what I like about my team. They're willing to tighten with me, and we tightened. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's good. And then I guess just lastly on that 10 million feet that you talked about leasing, I don't know if you or Rick could maybe provide a little detail, just broadly by category. Presumably, a lot of that was other things besides apparel. But can you just kind of help us give a breakdown of maybe how much was traditional apparel, how much was home, food, and just some of the broad categories to show the diversity of leasing? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: This is Rick. In our new leases that we have been signing, the percentage devoted to apparel is down about 20%. The percentage devoted to food and entertainment is up about 20%, and the number is over 11 million square feet this year over our three portfolios, which is malls, mills, and premium outlets. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay, thanks. That's it for me. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Hey, guys. I just want to say being from the Midwest, I agree, it's actually not that far out there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Right. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I had a question for Rick. I was just wondering if you can give us some high-level color here on the sales and traffic trends of the premium outlets versus the malls. And then maybe, just as a follow-up, can you comment on your watch list and any changes there? Maybe digging in a little bit, are you worried that we could get another bankruptcy or adverse retailer event here late in the year, whether it's a Charlotte Russe or anyone else of the troubled retailers out there? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We're not going to comment on individual retailers. That's not our place. Our premium outlet traffic is up. The mall traffic is stable. We're not seeing the kinds of trends that have been publicly reported by all these algorithms and black box things that have been out there and talked about in the trades. It's very stable and frankly, again under-reported, 2017, yes, there was a lot of bankruptcies. But frankly, we're also having many of our tenants get reorganized; emerge with very, very good balance sheets, and in the last several months, you've had Gymboree, Payless, rue21, all come out with restructurings with very stable balance sheets and growth strategies. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. On the occupancy that Mike Bilerman asked which I probably should have mentioned, I mean part of the dip in occupancy that we have is also we've added new product to the portfolio. So, they obviously, both in redevelopments, expansion space as well as new developments, they are never up to or 95% and I don't know what that number is... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: About 30 bps impact. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. So it's about a 30 basis point impact and I probably should have answered that when Michael asked in any event. So part of that is just the portfolio is expanding and you tend not to be initially at 100% occupancy when you open. But yet, once the space comes in, the space comes in our number and it is what it is. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, I appreciate that. And I guess, David, I was just wondering if you could just kind of talk about your appetite here for disposition, specifically kind of the lower end of the portfolio. You've talked about NOI-weighted results. So obviously further highlights how much of the revenue and value is really driven by the top. So as I think about the 13 \u2013 I think you have about 13 assets in the other bucket and maybe just more broadly some assets where, for whatever reason, the market or maybe demographics are moving against it. Does it make sense to sell those sooner versus later, or just how are you thinking about pruning the bottom from here? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Look, I think it's a question of your assets that don't fit with our portfolio, we generally have been a seller or spinner-offer of assets. The market is not great. On the other hand, I think we'll have at least a sale potentially by yearend or early next year. But it's a very simple \u2013 there's no asset here that we lose sleep over or that we have consternation over. And it's a function of \u2013 if we get the right price, we'll sell. If we don't and the present value of those cash flow is greater than the price, I mean \u2013 to me cash flow is still \u2013 there is nothing to be embarrassed about. I know this world doesn't want to focus on cash flow, but there's nothing to be embarrassed about cash flow. And I can take that cash flow and invest in something that's higher growth and that's okay. I mean, that's kind of what I think people like me should think about. But we'll continue to prune the portfolio. We're in pretty good shape, if the value is right, but we're not going to do anything that's a fire sale because we really have no need to \u2013 we can operate effectively. The thing about us is we can operate effectively from luxury centers to terrific suburban malls, west of the Hudson, to outlet centers, to the Mills product, to Europe, to Asia, to mixed-use properties. I mean, we have the ability \u2013 I mean, the fact \u2013 if you had only seen how this company dealt with these devastations, our multiple would go up, okay? You don't see it, but I see it. We had crews of people. We chartered plane. We had crews of people go down to Puerto Rico. We had people in the field that put their own personal situation on the back burner to deal with our physical assets. Crazy, crazy stuff. So, we can operate. I mean, people forget that we lost a mall in Nashville because of a flood that was shut down for, I can't remember, a year-and-a-half, two years? And we built it back better than ever. We'll build Puerto Rico back better than ever. Those assets are important to that community. We will deliver, and that's what people lose sight of. They want to focus on a metric here and there. I don't know. Sometimes it's interesting, but I don't know what you're asking. I forgot. But the point is, thanks for your question. If I didn't answer it, ask it again. Something about asset sales. The point is we operate in any kind of environment. We do extraordinary stuff. We give back to the community. Simon Youth Foundation is important, check into it, look at what we've done for the Komen Foundation with Breast Cancer Research, look at the fact that our operating income, somebody reported sales that had operating income of $347 million. We had $1 billion, $35 million of operating income, 3 times, what somebody else had, and focus on that. Focus on those kind of things I think would be helpful in your analysis. You should tell us what you want us to focus on. On the other hand, it's a two-way street, my friend. Thanks for your question. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think he called uncle. Next. Operator : And our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk about on the sales side, you guys did have a nice 3% increase this year year-over-year which is the strongest since 2013. So I was just wondering if you could comment where in the portfolio that was, if it was more the international tourists, high volume centers coming back or if it was across the board? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Simply put it's basically across the board. And you've got to remember, September, we've dealt with a lot of crap. So I mean I was really pleased with that number. It's across the board. And I think that there's definitely been a pause with all these natural disasters, but I mean unfortunately they hit us hard from Texas to Florida. Don't underestimate the Las Vegas impact. Thankfully we had nobody involved. But it's a tragedy that changes the psyche of the consumer for a period of time. I think I heard from Southwest Airlines that their flights down to Vegas are down. It will come back, but we had to deal with that. And unbelievably, I mean we've never had malls where we had to shut because of fires. The untold natural disasters, what's happened in Northern California, it's been unbelievable. We had our partner in a mall there whose own home burned down. I mean just tragic, tragic stuff. And then obviously, the Puerto Rico situation is at another level. So, even with all that said, our sales came in pleasantly surprised. I think the consumer mood is better. Look, we can talk online or not online, the reality is, I saw something interesting, how physical books outperformed. Electronic books, who knows, but maybe that's a trend. I think you'll see that as well. People get bored despite all of the rhetoric out there, you would expect me to say that. But generally sales and traffic are not bad, pretty good absent obviously these things going on and the tragedies of this unfortunate circumstances that we've had to deal with. And again, I wrote a letter to the company. I can't tell \u2013 and I don't know how many people listen from the company on the call, but I can't tell you how people have stepped up in this company dealing with these crazy, crazy events. Proud of the organization. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for that response. And then I was wondering on recent outlet development projects. Denver is under construction. It opens about a year from now. I'm wondering how the pre-leasing is going there and how that trajectory kind of a year from opening looks at this point versus I know Norfolk opened earlier this year and others of the past. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Great. I think that's going to be great. Denver is a great city. The growth there is phenomenal. It's a great site right on I-25. We are ahead of the outlets, took a bunch of retailers there last month. I think, we've got a great design. I think, it will be a great addition to the community there. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And I would say to you that there is still considerable demand in the outlet sector. Those tenants are growing and are actively looking for new opportunities. So, Norfolk now is performing very well and has got everyone open. And it's a lovely physical plant right on the water. We incorporated outdoor dining there. I mean, the \u2013 I would hope you go visit our product, Clarksburg, because the level of design and customer amenities is substantially elevated along with the tenant mix in these properties. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Oh, that's great to hear. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi. David, I think you said your NOI-weighted spreads were 17% in the quarter. When I look at my notes from last quarter, you talked about 14% spreads. Is that an apples-to-apples methodology so they actually increased in the third quarter? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes, sir. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess on the development pipeline, about $1 billion right now. Where do you see that number trending over the next two years or three years? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think it's got the potential to go up, frankly, because, as you know, we're going to have some opportunities like the King of Prussias of the world that are going to be really dramatic and change the face of some of these great pieces of real estate. So I think you'll see more from us in this area, even this year, that would tend to suggest that that number could be higher. Look, we are very focused on the redevelopment part of our business, investing in our product. We're actually in very good shape there. We've done a lot, as you know, since 2010. And we're still very optimistic on \u2013 we'll announce at least one more expansion of a material asset this year yet, Rick, probably, right... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There should be. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: ...with really good tenant demand. We'll announce another major mixed-use development at some point along the lines of King of Prussia that I talked about. So I think we've got good stuff working. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And I guess maybe for a second going back to the first question in the spreads again, going from 14% to 17%, does anything jump out over the last three months in terms of what would have caused that increase? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, we have such a large portfolio that they would have to jump really high to change a number. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it, okay. That was it, thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, no worries. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I think I had a little headset technical issue there before. But, David, you talked a lot about the dividend and the importance of the dividend, and obviously you increased it this quarter and alluded to increases in 2018. I know a lot of this has to do with taxable income and REIT rules and things like that. But I was just curious. As the markets continue to not really pay attention to the discount between the private market values versus your own stock, would you consider increasing the dividend more than you otherwise would in 2018 to continue to give back some of that return to shareholders? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think the simple answer to that is yes. If you look at where we are versus what we paid, obviously to keep increasing that level off a bigger base, that's a pretty big number. And I think the simple answer is yes. We have the ability to continue to grow our cash flow. And like I mentioned, I just encourage people to look at our operating income for the third quarter. It was $1 billion \u2013 operating income essentially being FFO, net income plus depreciation, more or less. It's $1.035 billion. Nobody gets excited about that number, but guess who does? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Guess who does? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I do. And you put it in comparison to other companies and some of their multiples, we are I think truly undervalued. But I'm not going to \u2013 Mr. Market is Mr. Market. We can only \u2013 I think a good way to demonstrate that is by raising our dividend on a consistent basis. We'll continue to do that. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then just maybe going back to your comments about the psyche of the consumer, obviously there's been a lot of unusual things going on in the country here and with the natural disasters and Las Vegas, as you mentioned. Overall traffic sounds like trends are stable. But I'm just curious if the traffic trends in Florida, Houston, and Vegas as well, sounds like maybe not Vegas, but Florida and Houston, have they returned to normal? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's interesting. What happens \u2013 unfortunately, we've seen this before. What happens it does \u2013 and I will say this to you. Prior to this like string of natural disasters, the business was actually \u2013 sales and traffic were up. They were good. And what happens generally is you lose the week before because there's the preparation and then you lose two, three, four weeks after because obviously people are not yet back to normal. Houston, having just visited Houston, we didn't really have that much property damage, but there was unbelievable amount of damage to that city. Now, give it to Houstonians and Texans, they come back fast and hard. Florida probably is wild because it was East Coast, West Coast, East Coast, West Coast. That hurricane couldn't make up its mind where it was going to hit. But the reality, it does slow traffic and sales. Florida is back a little bit more normal. I think Houston took a little bit longer to get back to normal given the amount of devastation there. Vegas, we were having a great September in Las Vegas, great. I think that's going to take some time. What happened there is horrific. But we'll see. It's so hard to predict, but these things, they don't just snap back day one. It does take time for people to get in their normal pattern. And I don't blame them, frankly. They've got other things to worry about. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, I agree. Okay, thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open. Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. David or Rick, going back to your watch list and some questions about that, I was hoping that your early read on whether 2018 will be a better or worse year for store closures and bankruptcies based on what you've seen with tenants dropping off the watch list and reselling this year. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Look, I know we all want to talk about 2018. As you know, we don't talk about 2018 till our year is done. You're more than welcome if you would like next week, you can come to Indianapolis, spend. We go through space by space 200 properties, so it's mind-numbing. But we're doing our business plan for next year. If you want to burn a day or two or three or four or a weekend, come on in. We'll show you how we run the business. But we'll tell you about 2018 when we tell you about 2018. All I can tell you is that we've got a great real estate operating model that has historically worked over many years and many cycles. We've weathered lots of storms one way or another. We'd certainly love a better natural retail environment. It's not quite there, it was headed there. We'd like a more stable retailer environment. We're diversifying away from the have-nots to the haves. That takes time, but you can't duplicate our real estate. You can't duplicate our balance sheet. You can't duplicate the fact that this company can operate across this country as well as in many parts of the world. And we put it all together. We put it in a blender. We pull the right triggers, and lo and behold, we grow our earnings, and that's what we're all about. I don't expect 2018 to be any different than the history, but I've got the next two, three weeks of planning for the execution of 2018. But like I said, we planned for 2017. We're doing a good job in 2017. We're overcoming a lot. Whether it's retailer bankruptcies, natural disasters, changing market conditions, we did the same thing in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, even in 2009. It is what it is. Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just going back to that second question, going back to re-leasing spreads, which I know is one of your favorite topics, you talked about the NOI spreads getting better, value weighted spreads getting better this quarter, yet the ones on page 23 of the supplemental, that spread got a bit worse this quarter versus last year. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think that's a simple \u2013 the simple thing is that we had more. We put everything in there, so we had more box deals, so that tends to damper down the spread for the entire portfolio as opposed to the ones that don't have as much box activity in the NOI weighted. It's as simple as that. It's not always like that, but... Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And you \u2013 but just \u2013 yeah. No. Yeah. Just to be clear here though. If we're thinking about the impact to your cash, same-store NOI, are the numbers, the spreads that are on page 23 more important or the ones that you're citing on the NOI weighted spreads? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Look, the reality is there's so much that goes into NOI spreads is just one element of it. So, I think, you put it all in the blender, and \u2013 look, we've been operating with our NOI with the strong dollar with our overage rent down significantly, yet we've produced pretty damn good NOI \u2013 comp NOI number growth. So there's so much that goes into it that it's hard. I would tend to look at \u2013 if I had to look at it, it's probably more important to look across the board, but they're both metrics for you to Q1. I don't \u2013 honestly, I've never run my business for metrics other than one, and guess what that is? Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : It's dividend growth. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, no, no, no. Cash flow growth, okay. Okay. Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's the only metric I worried about, okay. So it is what it is. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. On Puerto Rico, sorry if I missed this, what's the basis point impact of Puerto Rico on SS NOI in the fourth quarter? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's $0.03 FFO all-in because we don't anticipate any BI and/or those centers right now to be opened by the end of the fourth quarter. But they might be, but we don't anticipate it. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So you wouldn't quantify it from a basis point impact on SS NOI? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's less than one \u2013 it's out of NOI. It's completely out. There is no NOI that we're going to be booking in the fourth quarter. Is that your question? Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Well, okay. I guess maybe from an NOI impact, what would it have been? Or how much is the take away? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Less than 1% essentially. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then in your lease negotiations with some of the retailers that have been challenged, if you look at you've handled them this year, I realized that's retailer by retailer and location by location. But are there any takeaways you can share from this process on how you might approach the leases that are coming up for renewal next year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It really \u2013 I think, you answered it best. It really is space by space, retailer by retailer. I mean, I think, we really don't \u2013 we do across the board account, client-oriented leasing as you might imagine, but it is space-by-space, lease-by-lease. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And I would also tell you that, we're already working very significantly on next year's activity and we can evaluate now where we think market rents are going to be for the spaces coming up and we're doing everything that we can to have alternative users. So we'll have incremental bargaining power in that renewal process. If we don't get a rent we like, that tenant is going to be gone and we're going to bring in a new more productive tenant that's going to pay us more rent. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, a couple. First, I guess David, the percentage of NOI from U.S. malls has continue to drift down over the last couple years, the spin of WPG a few years back certainly accelerated a piece of that. But now you're at below 50% for the first time in your corporate history, so I'm curious what you think the right balance of U.S. mall exposure is going forward in light of the new retail paradigm. And then also as part of that, curious if you're seeing any interesting acquisition opportunities out there. Anything that might be \u2013 that might fit your quality spectrum and are you sensing any change in the psyche of any of the owners of those quality assets? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, on the last question, not really. We're really not looking externally to \u2013 if we get approached, we'll certainly consider something but we're actually not looking that much externally. As you know, the big focus has been on the redevelopment, new development and that continues to take up most of our time. Look, I don't \u2013 we're not running away from \u2013 I just simply \u2013 the math is the math. The opportunities are the opportunities. The fact that we \u2013 we have always considered ourselves as a retail real estate company. I think, as things have changed, we now consider ourselves as a \u2013 we're going to have more mixed use opportunities. So that's going to change the mix a little bit on the margin, but we're not running away from the mall business, or running away from the U.S. business because literally, we look at opportunities, so granular. Like the previous question about how you look at leasing, it's space by space, mall by mall. I mean that's how we look at the opportunity set that we have here. And because of that, we may \u2013 the U.S. may go down \u2013 U.S. malls may go down, but it's really because we saw opportunities elsewhere not because we're running from the mall business. We went in the outlet business in 1998, and I made a \u2013 we built \u2013 it's a funny story if you got a minute. We built a mall for $4 million of equity in Orlando. It shows you how just stupid I am. But at the same time, we spent this money on the Internet and we lost \u2013 remember \u2013 by the way, we were ahead of our time. Some of this stuff today probably will be worth $100 billion, but okay. But we made some mistakes. I think, we had a $30 million write-off back in \u2013 around that period of time. And I \u2013 we built that outlet mall in Orlando. I had $4 million of equity. I look \u2013 I think of my \u2013 what's our return on equity. David Bloom at Chelsea at that time came to me and said he wanted to own 100% of Orlando, and I go, well, not really. But he said, no, I'll give you $40 million for it. And so that was a 10x in about a year, which even the smartest private equity or venture capital guys like 10x in a year. I said, okay. Little did I know, in 2004, I'd buy it back at a number even greater than that. But the point is we like to go where the opportunities are. We bought Klepierre in 2010 when the euro was going to be disbanded. We bought it at under NAV. So that \u2013 it's more \u2013 that's more our philosophy than, boy, I want to reduce the percentage of our mall business in the U.S. to get to this number, if that helps at all, and answers your question. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Certainly does. Certainly. I appreciate the perspective. And also I guess, speaking of opportunities, I'm curious on your thoughts on JCPenney this morning. Not asking for you to comment on them specifically as a retailer. I know you don't do that. But was more curious about how you might be thinking about potentially buying back some of those boxes, maybe re-tenanting opportunities. And are there any natural expirations or store closures on the horizon that you might be concerned about? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we really \u2013 I haven't really studied the Penney numbers, obviously. I know they weren't that good. We have confidence in JCPenney. I mean, obviously they had a \u2013 they're still recovering from the activity that occurred when they had a different shareholder base. And I have \u2013 I think that Marvin Ellison has done a very good job. We think they serve a real need to the consumer. I do think there's still unfortunately dealing with some of the traumatic events of their different shareholder base. That's taking time, but it's cash flow generating company. We'll study the number, see what they all mean, but I think they definitely have a loyal consumer base and have a business that generates operating cash flow and I don't expect anything too radical there. But I think over time, we are going to want to get some space back from the department stores and we may get some space back but it's all going to be on the margin. They don't pay any rent even at places where they pay rent. So, the opportunity to re-tenant those buildings on an accretive basis is pretty, pretty significant for us. And to the extent that they're not investing in their store and we are investing in the mall, there is a disconnect to the consumer that we hope to \u2013 potentially, we can modify that disconnect by having a better or different use. We're poised. We're focused on it. We spend a tremendous amount of time assessing what we want back, what we might give back and I think the opportunities are a lot more significant in what we want back than what we might get back. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And just with respect to your question on their leases in 2015 and 2016, they had 14 options, all were exercised. In 2016 and 2017, they had seven; all were exercised. In 2018, they have 6, 4 have already been exercised and we expect the other 2 to be exercised. So we've not been experiencing any closures through lease actions with Penney. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And one last more, if I can squeeze one in, I'm not sure if I missed it or if you didn't specifically mentioned what drove the year-over-year decline in that home and regional office costs? Is it just that you're right-sizing the organization given the smaller asset base and does that flow through same-store NOI? Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. Primarily, the reduction in our incentive comp and LTIP primarily. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it. And then, is it \u2013 thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, we're really not reducing, I mean \u2013 we're really not reducing any kind of overhead on that kind of base. So we're just \u2013 you get us for a cheaper price. Some may think that's good; some may think that's bad. But it is what it is. As I've said... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We're always down. [00330F-E Steve Hilton : We're on sale, so good point. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I agree, I agree. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good point. Operator : Our next question comes is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys, and given that my family is from Kentucky, I can assure you in the end it's not that far out there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: All right. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. I want to talk a little bit about your same-store NOI. I'll preface this. I know you focus on cash flow and you look \u2013 we do as well. But how much do you think that same-store NOI might be being helped or might be helped by the development pipeline? The development pipeline obviously looks like it's a really big growth engine for you now and you started putting dollars in there... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's not in the comp NOI number, so until it's open for a year. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. And, David, what I was trying to think about was last year, you put up 2.2% in 3Q 2016 prior to... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Let me just reinforce this \u2013 and I've made this statement, Rich, historically, we do not look at our comp NOI on a quarterly basis. We do not look at that. Never have, never will. We look at it over a year. We told the market that we hope to do 3%. I think that's without lease settlement income, without new development, kind of a pure number, and we're on our way to do at least that. And for that, given all the complexity in the world today, that's pretty good. That's what I focus on. I do not focus on third quarter number. I don't focus on the second quarter number. We give you the facts. We tell you and we look at it on holistic year basis because when overage rent comes in and out, it's variable, it's when they hit it, they could hit it in the third quarter, they could hit it in the fourth quarter. Third quarter tends to be the lower end of our comp, if you're Interested in that, I don't really look at that. I don't know what else I can tell you other than how I think about it, and that's how I think about it, okay? Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. So let me ask the question maybe a little bit different way. 3% same-store NOI guide for the year. I think at midpoint, how much do you think your development pipeline is influencing that versus your core portfolio, or is that just not something that... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I answered that. That's not in the number. Okay? Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. It's all in the 8-K. You can see the components of comp NOI, and you can see the other new development which is not in the comp NOI. We've made that clear for a long period of time. Okay? Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm curious. You guys produce obviously a lot of cash. You've been talking about that today. But you didn't repurchase shares in this quarter. Can you speak more broadly about how you're thinking about capital allocation in the next 12 to 24 months, and do you think you'll be using a greater share of your capital for redevelopment and expansions and where do repurchases factor into that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: You probably were bored, which I don't blame you, right? We answered that question earlier, which is basically we've been \u2013 because of some of these mixed-use opportunities like King of Prussia that I've mentioned before, we think our redevelopment pipeline is going to potentially increase. So we're being very judicious on that. In addition, the more I think about it, I just love raising this dividend 10% per year because the cost to carry on that is increasing. And I think that's more meaningful to long-term investors than episodic buybacks here and there. But it's in our arsenal. It's in our capital toolbox. We'll take it a step at a time. But we've got some really big mixed use opportunities and I just love having a powerful balance sheet. I just can't tell you how it excites me every morning. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess I should have asked it differently. I guess the question is it's not off the table then. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's never off the table, no. We have authorization and it's ready to go to work if in fact we're ready to go. And I would take that authorization seriously. Otherwise, we wouldn't have it. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And maybe this is a joint one for you and Rick. But I'm curious how are lease terms evolving in this environment and specifically around percentage of rents because frankly, I'm wondering if you think landlords get a fair shake on the accounting for retail sales because it strikes me that given the way consumers shop today, buying online, maybe returning in store, the reporting optics maybe favor the online channel of a retailer versus the bricks-and-mortar, and I'm just curious if you think leases need to adapt for that. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Our leases are very well positioned to cover that point, and we are very focused on making sure that all the sales that are required to be reported under our leases are being reported. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Jeff, I will tell you this. And I think you point out a really important point is that we are absolutely unequivocally underreporting sales. We can only give you what we get from the retailers. But we've done enough work to know that there is an issue there and I think our sales that we report to you would be higher even \u2013 and we have very interesting leases that deal with the point that Rick is making. But I am absolutely convinced that our productivity is much higher than what's being reported, even though the lease requires them to do so. So I don't want to get into that, it's a complicated matter, but what you point out is very, very interesting. Now the market rewards \u2013 let's face it, the market rewards an online sale more importantly than it does a brick-and-mortar, so the market is trying to get retailers. The retailers would rather prefer an online sale to a bricks-and-mortar regardless of the possibility. But it's a very interesting point. And I will tell you today, in my humble opinion, there is absolutely an underreporting going on. But I don't want to say anything other than that. Okay? Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Understood. Do you think they have the systems? Most retailers have the systems to be able to handle whatever the new form of reporting would be? Like you said, they don't really have an incentive to adapt. But again, I'm just curious of these new leases you talk about, if you think they could be more broad-based in the future? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Generally, they know what they should be reporting, I would say so. And again, I want to leave it at that. Let's leave it at that. It's a good point. But I will tell, I do think it's safe to say that the numbers we have are underreported, absolutely underreported. It's a very astute point. And by the way, we're not giving that up on future leases. So because it's all melding, but you bring up a very interesting point, and I prefer not to talk about it after this. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. I have just one last question. I'm just curious. I'm sure in this environment you've been contacted by private capital sources maybe to look at JV-ing properties and whatnot. What sort of returns do you think they are looking for when they approach you guys? Are you able to speak to that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm not sure. To do something new or to buy? I'm not sure I... Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : To buy interest in your existing properties. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We've had this discussion. I'm not really \u2013 I don't \u2013 that doesn't do much for us. So it's not something we really are pursuing. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, thanks. And sorry to you longer today, but just a couple follow-up questions. On the department stores, just given overhang on the stocks, on the mall stocks, are you seeing any initiatives that you're more positive on, or anything you could share from what you're hearing from your mall managers on some of the things we're reading about or seeing, because I would have thought, given your dominant properties, a lot of these initiatives would be occurring in your properties at those department stores. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's a big question. Look, I don't want to really get in too much about having a discussion with our clients. Look, I think ambiance, service, speed of execution is really important in today's consumer-oriented focus. I do think there are things that can be done at the store level that will improve that. I think as simple as a fast checkout at a store would improve sales and productivity dramatically. And there has been a huge focus on technology investment towards their online activities. I'd love for that to shift towards the store environment, because that's a real advantage. And I think if they did that in a more comprehensive way, whether through checkouts, service, styling. There are so many things you can do today, much like Apple does when you go to their store and town squares. If the focus were to shift a little bit there, I think they would see a pickup in their in-store sales environment. And it's all over the board, Jeff, frankly. I do think it could improve. And just like what we need to do, we need to improve our in-store experience on the stuff that we can -the in-mall experience on the stuff that we can control. So I think it needs to be a greater focus. It's around the edges. I'd like a little shift in that, but we'll see if that happens. Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then another follow-up. Just listening to the comments on mixed-use earlier in the week, we received a lot of questions on the WeWork and L&T purchase, upper levels and... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Right. Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Rick and I were thinking okay, that's just a unique situation. Maybe there are a few other properties like that in the country. But I'm listening to your mixed-use comments. Do you think that a WeWork type of format, do you see that entering suburban malls or your malls, or that's not what you're talking about? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, that's included in what we're talking about. Just so you know, we did a WeWork steal in Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas. So no, I do think that environment will absolutely accelerate in the \u2013 again, I don't know that I would call these suburban. It's where the good demographic people live outside an urban area. There are still 330 million people, okay. Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Urban and suburban. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. I know New York City and San Francisco is urban environment, but there are lots of places outside of those where people live and work and play and be entertained. So the answer is yes, I expect us to do more and more with WeWork both directly like we did at Clearfork and through our relationship with Lord & Taylor. We know those guys. We like them. I've spent time with them. They're very creative. Both companies are very creative. L&T or HBC in that case as well as WeWork, good people too. I like them. Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then my last question, I was just curious with the Amazon-Whole Foods merger. Are you more or less interested in adding grocers to your malls? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No real chain. Chain, I think we've always liked it where it made sense for both parties, and the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods doesn't change our thinking. I don't know if it's changed their thinking, Whole Foods' thinking, but it certainly hasn't changed our thinking. We'd love to have them in the properties where it makes sense for them and for us. Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks so much. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just regarding The Edit @ Roosevelt Field, how are you connecting with and choosing these digitally borne concepts to participate in this effort? How are you leveraging your venture capital business in this? And is there a plan to roll this out further to more of your centers as you think about this as an incubator for new retailers? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The answer is absolutely. Assuming this has legs, this will be rolled out throughout our network, and you have to look at our platform as a network and this will absolutely roll out. The great news is we've got a team dedicated to up-and-coming new retailers that may start digitally and then go online. Like MeUndies is a good example of that where we're opening a pop-up store in Stanford. So we have a team wholly dedicated to that. We also appear here which is a network where we're both an investor and a player. They actually started in London and have a number of \u2013 basically a platform that connects real estate owners with brands that want access to a portfolio in a very seamless way. They've also been instrumental in identifying up and coming retailers or concepts. And so, it's a big effort on us to do that. And not only that but also lease, not just through what we're doing at The Edit, but also through just normal deals like the UNTUCKits of the world. I mean there's a lot of that new business out there that is exciting for us because we are bringing in the up and coming retailers or food operators that know how to connect directly through the consumer, but also have a little different spin on how they connect with the consumer in the in-store environment. I think they're very smart, digitally savvy, speaks to Millennials, we love them as part of our platform and our properties. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just given the natural seasonality of retailer income, how should we be thinking about the impact of Aeropostale, the Aeropostale investment in Q4? So what's in your guidance? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we don't break out that. It's in our guidance. We're pleased with the business. We bought it very \u2013 we're weighing the money. They're performing according to plan. I don't give out quarterly numbers, but there's a little more volatility in the fourth quarter like a lot of retailers, even tech companies have a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter. There's a little bit more of that than what we have, since it's our first fourth quarter. Let's see what goes on. But we're weighing the money. We basically bought in at one time's cash flow. I kind of like those deals. If you have a few more of those, send them my way. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, David. It's Michael. If we can just come back to the professional fees and other, it's like a $34 million, $35 million increase in the quarter. I thought the settlement on Woodbury was just under $1 million. So that would be a hell of a lot of legal hours even at $1,000 an hour. So can you just break out just the big chunks of that $35 million because it's not an inconsequential number and I think (1:23:16). David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think it's actually almost irrelevant because it's a one-time number and it is what it is, okay. So I'd actually argue that there's no reason to focus on it because it's out of the ordinary and it's not going repeat. And unfortunately, this is a very expensive scenario that we have to deal with. The fee was nominal which reinforces what we \u2013 the fact that we, again, we made an announcement how we felt about it. I don't need to relive that. It's behind us. And so I'd actually argue the opposite of that just like the Seritage sale. It goes through the numbers but I wouldn't count \u2013 we're not going to replicate that gain either. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. I didn't know where it was coming from. That was just all legal expenses (1:24:22). David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We have other things that run through that. We actually had a write-off. And again, not to get in minutia but we actually also took a write-off in one of our European outlet development projects that also flow through that, that's a one-time number, but the delta is one-time including that write-off, okay? So that's the important message to send here, okay? I wouldn't worry about it too much. I mean I don't like it. Believe me, I don't like it. I'm not happy with it. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: It's a big number, right? It's a big number, but... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm not happy with it, but like I said, we had a European development deal with McArthurGlen that flows through that other number as well. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: But it's non-repeating, and I appreciate your question. It's non-repeating. It's out of the ordinary. And that's all I can really add to it. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. No worries. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. We've exhausted everyone including myself, and for that, please join us next week as we go through space-by-space. Rick Sokolov will set up the appointments, and have a great weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does complete the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

David Simon : Okay, good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a very good year. Our FFO for 2017 was $11.21 per share which includes a $0.36 charge for the early redemption of our senior notes. On a comparable basis full year FFO per share was $11.57 an increase of 6.4% year-over-year which without question will be at the high end of our peer group. To put our FFO per share in perspective, the $11.21 is more than $4 billion in total funds from operation which is the highest amount we've ever reported and the highest in the industry. Through active portfolio management, disciplined investments, relentless focus on leasing and property management operations, our annual FFO has increased almost $1 billion since we completed the spinoff of Washington Prime Group less than four years ago, yes $1 billion. We have achieved a compound annual FFO rate of 8% over the last three years and more than 12% over the last seven years. Our growth rate has outpaced the growth rate of all equity reached by more than 400 basis points over the last seven years and has been more than double the rate of earnings-per-share growth for the S&P 500 over the same time period. For the fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was $3.12 an increase of 7.2% year-over-year on a comparable basis and as a reminder our fourth quarter results were impacted by the closure of our two Puerto Rican centers due to continuing restoration efforts of those centers. We continue to report solid operating metrics and growth of cash flow. Our malls and premium outlets occupancy at the quarter ended at 95.6% an increase of 30 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the third quarter. Our ending occupancy was impacted by the bankruptcies processed during the year as well as some of the new space we added to the portfolio from our new development and expansion openings. Leasing activity remained solid and improving. Average base rent was $53.11 up approximately 3% compared to last year and the mall and outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.42 an increase of 11.4%. Reported retail sales per square foot for our portfolio were $628 compared to $614, an increase of 2.3%. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.5% for the year or more than $265 million, and comp increased NOI increased 3.2% for the year 2.2% for the fourth quarter. On an the NOI weighted basis our operating metrics were as follows; retail sales - reported retail sales on an NOI weighted basis would be $779. Occupancy would be 96.3% and our average base minimum rent would be $68.97. We opened five new developments in '17 totaling 1.9 million square feet, which are promised to be really good additions to our portfolio. In the U.S. we opened Norfolk Premium Outlets; The Shops at Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas. Internationally we opened Siheung Premium Outlets in South Korea; Genting Highlands Premium Outlets in Kuala Lumpur and Provence Designer Outlets in obviously Provence, France. Construction continues on two new outlets in Edmonton Canada and Denver, Colorado, used to be called the Intermountain region for the call and they'll open in the spring and fall of this year respectively. We've also started construction on two international outlet projects in Mexico and Malaga, Spain and both of these are expected to open in the fourth quarter this year. Transformational redevelopments and expansions at our marquee properties continue adding a total of 635,000 square feet including La Plaza Mall in place of a former Sears store. Other expansions include The Galleria in Houston the second phase of The Shops at Riverside Woodbury Commons, Allen Premium Outlets and Roermond Designer Outlet in the Netherlands. We will also complete major redevelopment expansion projects this year at some of our most productive properties including the Aventura Mall, the redevelopment at Town Center at Boca, and the Toronto Premium Outlets expansion. In addition we expect to begin construction this year on a number of transformational projects where we will replace department stores with significantly more productive uses at Phipps Plaza, King of Prussia and Southdale Center. As a reminder, we expect to fund these redevelopments and expansions and densification projects with our internally generated cash flow after our ever increasing dividend. Now, let me talk about the fourth quarter. We acquired and gained control of 12 Sears Stores in our portfolio. We acquired the 50% interest from Seritage in our JV of five Sears Stores and they are included Brea Mall, Burlington Mall, Midland Park Mall, Ocean County Mall, and Ross Park. As part of the transaction Sears announced these five stores will be closing in the next few months and we will begin redevelopment shortly thereafter. We have now acquired the right to terminate five leases, existing leases of Sears Stores at the following locations; Broadway Square, Cape Cod Mall, Northshore Mall, South Hills Village and Tacoma Mall and we also bought two Sears Stores at Stoneridge shopping Center and Wes Town Mall. Turning to the capital markets of course we were active continuing to lower our borrowing cost. We issued $2.7 billion of new senior notes with an average term of just under eight years 7.9 to be accurate at a weighted average coupon of 3.07% and retired $2.6 billion of senior notes saving 60 basis points. We amended and extended our $4 billion dollar revolving credit facility and lowering our pricing grid at the same time and towards in 2022. We completed 20 mortgages totaling 2.9 billion which our share is 1.8 at an average interest rate of 3.37% and the term is 6.7 years. Our liquidity ended the year at approximately $8 billion. We continue without question having the strongest credit profile in the REIT industry, in the entire world, we ended 2017 with a net debt to EBITDA of 5.5 times. Our interest coverage ratio was 5 times and we continue to have an A and A2 rating which we actually think is under valuing our credit. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever providing us with superior operating financial flexibility to continue to create long term value for our shareholders. And I reiterate this is a distinct advantage that continues to be overlooked by the market. Dividend, we paid a record dividend in 2017 of $17 or $7.15 per share and achieved a compound annual dividend growth rate of more than 11.5% over three years and more than 15% over the last seven years and today we announced our first quarter dividend of $1.95 per share for this quarter and year-over-year increase of 11.4%. Now turning to guidance and we're ready for your questions, our guidance range is $11.90 to $12.02 per share. This represents 6% to 7% growth rate compared to our 11.21 we reported. Our range is based on the following assumptions; portfolio, NOI growth about 3%. No planned acquisition or disposition activity. Interest rate and foreign exchange rates based on current consensus and a continued share count - diluted share count of approximately 350 million shares. We are now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Caitlin Burrows : Good morning. Since 3Q earnings, we all know that M&A has been in the headlines for the industry and you didn\u2019t touch on it in the prepared remarks. So I was just wondering, well first, as far as we know you didn\u2019t put in a counter bid for Westfield and GGP, so I think your stock might be lower based on conversations we've had. But second, you said in the past that you're out of the big deal business and my question is more just around why, what's different now versus in the past when acquisitions like [indiscernible] DeBartolo and Prime made sense, is it that the math doesn\u2019t work out at current share price, could it work with more leverage, but you don\u2019t want to go there? Is it operation where you get less out of it than in the past? Just wondering what's different now versus in the past? David Simon : Well, I means that's \u2013 I think I need a written, I need that listed in a written way that I answer all of them. Look, I think, here's what's ironic and funny about all this M&A activity. The market was dying to have a mark on a portfolio. Okay? Dying. Well, my God we don\u2019t know what the value of regional malls are. Unibail as you know has agreed to acquire Westfield and they did it at a very healthy evaluation and yet the market yawned on it. So I just find the whole thing ironic. We continue to be out of the big deal business. We're not involved in any of the activity there. And your best asking you know those participants how they feel about it. We've got a lot to do to continue to grow our company. Nobody has our growth, I mean high to sit back and think about we grew our FFO, we spun off by the way with WPG I think if I remember right about $200 million of FFO more or less. We made a billion two back and did not with a lot of M&A activity frankly. So we've got a lot to do. We don't need to do anything. I think all of this activity reinforces the strategy that we've had that I think scale in any and all industries is important. Our balance sheet is underappreciated. I think if you look at the Unibail Westfield transaction and compare their debt to EBITDA and compare to ours at 11.5 to 5.5 with the same ratings, you will see the amount of firepower that we have. But right now that firepower is on the sidelines and we're not involved in any of the activity. But anything that we do I'm pretty sure that will add value to including, you know including you know buying, remember when the market puked all over Rio [ph] Postell [ph] I am happy to tell you it had a record year OPCO [ph] did over $40 million of EBITDA. We bought it for 1 times cash flow and it's alive and kicking. So you know, whatever we do we're hoping to add value to and we wouldn\u2019t do a transaction including any redevelopment or development that wouldn\u2019t add value to, but the market's got it's mark and I think the market should be pleased that it's got its mark. Caitlin Burrows : Thanks for that and I guess just on that topic of staying on the sidelines, I just want to hear your thoughts on does that mean though that Simon as the company is still in touch with discussions that are going on, deals that are occurring and it's a deliberate decision to stay in the headlines? I've heard some concern from others that by staying in the sidelines Simon might be missing out on some rare opportunities. So I just want to hear your take on how I'm assuming that's not actually the case? David Simon : Well, again I say we're not active, but I can and that's activity, but I would venture to say we typically be, we're typically buyers when no one else is, and we're typically not buyers when everybody else is. And that's just the way it's been and that's why we have $12 projected this year of earnings which is way ahead of everybody. That's why we have the balance sheet that we had that's way ahead of everybody. And you know we're a little bit different than most. I hope you accept it and appreciate it. Caitlin Burrows : Got it and then just one on a different topic if I could. You mentioned the firepower that you guys have in terms of your balance sheet. Just looking at your development pipeline, the portion that's in process now, it is down from last year and the year before. So I was just wondering what the outlook is to getting this up again? I know you mentioned a few upcoming transformational projects that would suggest that they weren\u2019t yet in process as of the end of the year or is that the amounts that have been completed just haven't been able to be replenished? David Simon : Well, look we - for whatever reason we don't put a \u2013 you know we don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know, the word fabricate is a bad word, but we don\u2019t put our shadow pipeline in numbers. What Tom does is show you what deals we've approved and basically are under construction. So as an example, the Sears transaction that I spoke about, none of that redevelopment activity is in that number, nor is Phipps, or is King of Prussia you know and I'll go down the list. So what we do is we tell you the truth. When we approve it and we're about to spend money on it and it's been approved by our appropriations committee, it goes into the 8-K and we spit it out to the market. We don\u2019t think we need to do a shadow pipeline because you know I don't know it's a waste of energy to try and do it. We have plenty to do and we'll be as aggressive as ever, but on the other hand one of the hallmarks of our company is our return on investment and return on equity, because without that you can't grow your earnings. And we are about growing our cash flow. Cash flow growth leads to dividend growth which ultimately or discounted cash flow model leads to more value in the company. Operating metrics do not. Okay? Operating metrics do not. What leads to valuation growth in my opinion and certainly in the real community there may not, may be not as a technology area, but is cash flow growth, return on investment, and you know, so I - so the long answer to your question is, we have a lot to do and a lot of these projects are in the process of being finalized in terms of scope, scale, pricing. And once we formally approve it, it feeds into our 8-K and you'll see that number go up. Caitlin Burrows : Got it, thanks for that and yes I work hard. If you want know that I noticed that the rate of return did increase to 9% so that's great to see. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Spector : Good morning, it's Jeff Spector here with Craig. David Simon : Hi guys. Jeffrey Spector : Hi, good morning. Just a clarification on the guidance. I believe David, you said that portfolio NOI growth over 3%. Can you provide a little bit more detail on that? Is that \u2013 that's not same-store correct that you're just talking about the prior\u2026? David Simon : That is not same-store, same-store the way we define it will be slightly less than that. We're trying not that I want to like name companies, I've already named one. It's probably not a good idea to keep doing it. But we want \u2013 you know we see what others do like Federal where you focus on the NOI growth. We're trying to get you know as our company gets bigger, you know the impact of the expansion and a new project becomes less and it's easier for us to describe it just in terms of our total portfolio NOI so we're trying to get folks to start thinking about like that like they do with federal and again I'm not criticizing great company. I'm jealous, much higher multiple, and it seems to like the way they do it and so we're focused on that. But it will be slightly less than the 3% based on our numbers today. Jeffrey Spector : And can you provide any of the details behind that in terms of let's say occupancy expectation or\u2026? David Simon : We are doing it exactly the way we did the last year and one year after. We do not provide leasing spread forecast. We do not provide the occupancy forecast. We've never done that Jeff and I have no real desire to do it. You know, again we can - we can - we can just be obsessed with metrics, I'm obsessed, we're continuing to grow our company, make our company better. I'm not obsessed with metrics and I think unfortunately you know we can - we can get into that the rabbit hole. But the reality is I'd encourage you to look at $12 compared to the peer group, look at our multiple, look at our dividend yield and then come up with your investment recommendations. Jeffrey Spector : Okay thanks. I think Craig has a followup. David Simon : Sure. Craig Richard : I just want, great \u2013 I just wondered as the project is changing in some degrees that lets you go from 7% to 9% in the stabilized returns for the malls? David Simon : There's always a mix change. We are excited. You know, and again Craig, we are - we are excited about, you know the redevelopment efforts that we've got on the drawing board, you know from Phipps to King of Prussia to the Sears transaction. So there's going to be, I can't tell you how excited we are to get, you know to get these spaces back, where the media likes to make it as the beginning of the end, we think it's the rebirth. Okay? And I can't tell you how excited we are to continue to do our - you know, our varied redevelopments. You know the biggest issue for us is just managing all the activity. It's not from an investment point of view. You know, again if you look at our business, people can grow their company if they increased their leverage. Right? Now technology companies, if you looked at their quarter-to-quarter increase in debt you'd be really surprised by how much you know maybe they are buying growth, we're actually trying to keep our balance sheet relatively flat because we know that there's a lot to do. So in that sense if you look at our net debt it's relatively flat year-over-year which is still kind of remarkable given that we've had all this activity. Richard Sokolov : And Craig I would just say, you just followed our NOI has been increasing every quarter, projects roll off and new ones roll on. The beauty of our redevelopment positioning is that we are able to manufacture new redevelopment projects to continue to enable us to grow our cash flow. Craig Richard : Great, and then just of the 12th that you have started did you gain control, how many will be under construction in '18? David Simon : Well, that's hard to say. I mean we still have permitting to go through. So I \u2013 let's put it this way, all of these are well advanced in terms of plans and we're all through \u2013 we're going through the permitting process, but I would hope to begin a handful this year. Craig Richard : Okay, great, thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Good morning. I have three questions here. I guess first, what was the NOI weighted weakened spread compared to the 11.4% you reported? Second, can you kind of talk about 2018 store closure expectations versus what we saw last year? And then third, it's little bit more of a technical question, curious why the Edmonton Outlets are considered a Mills project on the supplemental as opposed to an Outlet project? David Simon : Well, I'll try to take them in the reverse order. So it's basically, if you know [indiscernible] they basically own the Mills up in Toronto, Vaughan Mills. They built one in Vancouver, South Vancouver. And if you look at Edmonton it's really enclosed. It's got a lot of the big boxes and it's really more of a mills type of physical product than it is in outlet center where the outlet centers tend to be open air and village settings. So it's got \u2013 I don\u2019t know off the top of my head, but 12 to 13 boxes at least, you know similar to what we would have here in our mills and what they would have there up in their Canadian mills. So it really is - it's really a Mills project. Second is, you look \u2013 if I remember the numbers 90 and 2015 we lost 900 some odd thousand, 2016 we lost 300,000, 250 to 300, 000, 2017 we lost a million too. Right? Good numbers see? Okay, so my memory is still with me. And we \u2013 look, it's hard to predict, but I would think that it's going to be significantly less than 2017 and that's the good news. And the opportunity is look we \u2013 you know, it is much as you and I want it more than you want it, okay? So let's just be clear. I want it more than you want it for that lease have to occur when you lose a million two. You know, it does take time and if you miss the season, you know it\u2019s a process. So and that's why to some extent our occupancy dropped in addition to some of our adding some new space that basically is over 2.5 million square feet in new space between the new centers and the expansions. So the reality is we got work to do to get our occupancy up. I expect that number to be down. And then on your final, the rent spread on the weighted is slightly less than that number, I don\u2019t have it at the top of my head which is I know surprises you, surprises me as well, but we can certainly work on that and get that to you. Michael Mueller : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb : How are you? David Simon : Good. Alexander Goldfarb : And I guess I'm fired up. So two questions from me. David Simon : Do you want me to be depressed, what do you want me to be Alex, talk to me, tell me how you want me to be? Alexander Goldfarb : You are always in a good upbeat mood, so I'll leave it there. And I assume you're going to Minneapolis in a few days. David Simon : Actually I'm not. I'm going to be watching my, no I am not going to be going to the Super Bowl. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, two questions David, the first one is on the tax cuts, the retailers themselves you know corporately are among the biggest beneficiaries on tax rate and yes there were north of 30% effective. So obviously you know they stand to benefit big time. We've seen wage increase, bonuses, what are you seeing from the retailers themselves as far as reinvestment in their stores, in their brands, in their platforms, and how do you think it plays out at your centers? David Simon : Well, I'll let Rick answer, I'll just be very, less wordy. You know, in my prepared remarks I said improving. So I think the fourth quarter sales were improving. Not every retailer, I mean some retailers yes, no, I mean but generally improving. The mood is improving. And obviously the tax \u2013 given where retail started with the board or adjustment tax to where it ended up, you know, I think is good for the general retailers and I think they've all concluded. Thankfully you know, some are in a better position to do it and then others that reinvesting in their store is not such a bad idea. Rick, you can add to that. Richard Sokolov : And we would obviously like to see them invest more because the physical atmosphere that we can provide in our stores is going to be very important. All three of our platforms were up year-over-year in sales. Happily we also found some firming in the tourism markets where several of the markets that had been down are now showing some strength, so that's helping as well and we are encouraged about the trends there. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay and then the second question is, David, between the impact on Puerto Rico and I'm not sure what you guys are now recovering on business interruptions during\u2026? David Simon : Well, Alex let me interrupt you there. We don\u2019t recover anything on that because I won't go through the arcane which I could, but I'll leave the accounting arcane treatment to the side. Reality is we cannot book business interruption insurance until we get so there is no - there is no income whatsoever when it comes to Puerto Rican assets okay? And we explained that to you last time. Even with that said when we started our guidance and put the redemption cost aside when we started our guidance I left some of these headlines about guidance short, guidance this, guidance that, yet no one, I'd never see the headline that says, highest growth in the industry. I\u2019m waiting for that, Alex you could probably start that trend. But even with losing Puerto Rico and the bankruptcies that in a lot of cases were unforeseen, we did beat our guidance that we laid out for you and this time last year okay? And not like our normal you know crush beat, but we beat it by $0.03, $0.04 something like that, and Tom I'm looking at Tom. So again, I just hope you appreciate that. I mean it's not - it just doesn't - we don't roll off the log here. We grind it out. We did beat our earnings when you take out the redemption charge despite Puerto Rico not being in the numbers and then obviously the decrease in the NOI loss from Puerto Rico which is not a crazy number, but it's few cents. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, well just to finish the question David. Just curious how the rise in interest rates but the benefit on FX, how those two netted out as you guys laid out your 2018 is it than that wash or is that favorable or unfavorable one way or the other? David Simon : Yes, it\u2019s basically a wash. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. David Simon : We're not that levered with that much floating rate debt for that to really hurt us that much and then obviously our international business is about 10%, so when you put it all together it's not going to - it's on the margin. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of the Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Omotayo Okusanya : Hi, yes. Good morning everyone. Just following up on Alex's question about FX, could you just talk about the impact of FX on same-store NOI in \u201917 where I believe there was a bit of a drag versus in \u201918 way to put it that consensus estimates and FX would actually be a positive to same-store NOI growth? David Simon : It's basically flat and again there's a good thing about it, it may help tourism in the U.S. which we get a benefit of. So we'll see, but so it's not material in a sense and I \u2013 and again remember that international, you know that's why we try to guide you toward portfolio NOI, but international is not in our comp NOI, you know that, right? Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. David Simon : Okay. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. David Simon : Okay, so the only benefit that we will see from the domestic which is what we do for same-store NOI is what impact the weaker dollar will have on the tourism spend okay? Not the foreign exchange number. You're with me, right? Omotayo Okusanya : Yes, correct. David Simon : Okay, okay, just want to make sure. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay, that's helpful. That makes a lot of sense. Second question, you have a kind of an expansive list of densification projects here that\u2019s kind of good to see. Just curious with your partner in that densification project, are you participating in any of the upside associated with these upcoming hotels or office buildings or anything of that nature? I'm just trying to understand and I'm trying to understand the relationship to how it works. David Simon : Well, yes of course we\u2019re partner - if we don't do it ourselves and we're partners of course we participate as a joint venture. A lot of these deals that we've done are 50-50 straight up deals. We get the value of the land which in some cases is higher than what our book basis is, it's never been lower and then we share in the upside absolutely. You know, and then I think with time there will be a trend for us to do more and more of these on our own. As an example at Fifth we plan on doing a hotel, the Nobu Hotel on our own. The office building that's programmed in that at this point is on our own. We may or may not bring a partner in, but although - if we do bring a partner we'll certainly have upside, if we don't just sell the opportunity at a premium and then let them develop it. Richard Sokolov : And I would point out that this densification is not new for us. We've been doing this for a decade and we've been reaping the benefits as we decide when we want to asset managing, we've sold a number of these densification projects and make a lot of money doing it. So we've been doing this for a long time and we're just going to come up with incremental opportunities. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay, so I guess the expectation has I mean, in \u201918 we should see decent increase in the income from unconsolidated entities from all these JVs? David Simon : Well, it's - a lot of these are under construction, so I don't think \u201918 is a big year for that, but they'll be you know there'll be some, I think you will continue to see more and more projects being added in our portfolio. We had a substantial increase quarter-over-quarter in the number that we included in the CAG. Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. Okay, just one more from me I appreciate the patience. There have been press releases about the Tijuana situation has been resolved between the two parties. Is there any color or commentary you can just kind of provide about lessons learned through that process? David Simon : From us? Omotayo Okusanya : Actually from both sides, because I\u2019m just kind of curious how was it settled, what's the ultimate decision? But does it give you confidence about system supporting your lease structures and I\u2019m just kind of curious? David Simon : I don't think it's fair to ask us. The last thing we want to do is get into an argument with one of our clients. However, if we feel like it's not and this is a generic statement, if we feel like it's not being appropriately dealt with we have no choice but to do what we did. It's not what we want to do. We're not in that business, but if we feel like we have to protect our position we will and it - but it took a lot of took \u2013 you know generically when you have these situations it takes a lot of judgment what to do and not something I'm excited about doing, but if we have to we will. Omotayo Okusanya : Fair enough. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Steve Sakwa : I guess David, on the buyback, I noticed that the volume was much, much lower in Q4 than in Q3 and I\u2019m just wondering was there anything that maybe precluded you from doing buybacks and was there something about the share price or just your liquidity obviously is in very good shape, so I just thought maybe some comments on the buyback and how you're thinking about that in 2018? David Simon : Well, we \u2013 well, I guess, I think as I look at \u201918 and I look at and I really study other credits that are like ours or that at least rated the same as ours, I shouldn\u2019t say like ours but rated the same as us, I see a lot more firepower than they do and that - it's important for us to maintain that rating. But I think we're underappreciated by how they evaluate things. So it is - a long story short, it gives me more \u2013 a stronger position to continue to be more aggressive than we were in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is just kind of an anomaly in that it wasn\u2019t anything legally precluding. There was a period of time when the stock really got hit. And we went in and then it jumped back up, so we and then before you know we're in the blackout period and then we can't do much more. So it's really more on that front, nothing other than that. But you know when I look at ratings of companies that are the same as ours, we have a lot more firepower and that gives me more confidence to be more, perhaps more aggressive here. Steve Sakwa : And just to be clear, you're not assuming within the earnings for next year that there's any buyback activity, so there's no benefit from potentially using the firepower on the buyback. David Simon : That is 100% accurate. Steve Sakwa : Okay and then just this is a little bit more of a medusa [ph] question, but when we look at kind of the income statement, home and regional costs as well as G&A were down substantially '17 over '16. And I'm just trying to figure out are the \u201917 numbers you think, sort of good starting points in run rates to think about \u201918 or was there something abnormal in \u201917 that brought us down versus \u201916. David Simon : No, I think they're pretty consistent. That's a new run rate. What I \u2013 at the beginning, you know the executives here did not have - and again you can get me going philosophically, but we decided not to take any long term incentive for \u201917 and take and express to the market that we're going to do what it takes to continue to run our business as we've also retired a couple of people that we're that we haven't replaced at those kind of levels. But I think those are pretty close to the run rate sort of more or less. If it's up it's more inflationary up than anything else, but I would look for that to be more the new normal, maybe slightly up just from an inflationary point of view. Steve Sakwa : Okay and then maybe just a touch back on lease and I know you sort of circled this a couple of times and your commentary about good and improving and maybe just get Ricks commentary, but as you sort of sit here today and kind of survey the landscape in the leasing environment versus a year ago, it much feel better but how many, if you just help us kind of quantify or think about kind of the environment today and the discussions with tenants versus say six months or twelve months ago? Richard Sokolov : It's Rick, Steve. It is clearly a firmer environment. The tenants are more constructive in their view of their store platforms. If you looked at all of the comments that the tenants had coming out of ICR, I think all of them basically were saying that we have made progress getting our portfolios right side. David has already commented. We view \u201918 as hopefully going to be a less debilitating year in terms of reworks and bankruptcies and we're doing a lot of refit. We have made substantial progress on the bankruptcy space. We got back. We're leasing it on rent. That for the most part are higher than the rents that the bankrupt tenants had and we are encouraged and frankly it doesn't hurt that we have a great portfolio of properties that tenants want to be in. David Simon : And there seems to be just one other small point on that is there seems to be a lot of the, and without naming names, a lot of the folks that are, that were a little sketchy last year seemed to stabilize their business a little bit more. So again, that doesn't mean there's not a shoe to drop with you know one retailer versus the next. But it does seem \u2013 there does seem to be a sense that some of the folks that we're \u2013 could have gone left or right are kind of stabilizing their business. Steve Sakwa : Okay, great thanks. That's all from me. David Simon : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Bilerman : Hi it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Maybe Rick or David, just sticking on the leasing these, as you think about the pace of your openings, this year been a sub page 23 you are at 6.7 million square feet, you had been a little bit over 8 million the year before and consistently in that 7.5 million to 8 million type or range. You have almost 8 million square feet expiring in \u201918. Can you talk sort about that actual pace and if you feel like there's going to be an increase in the opening pace or what may have held back some of the openings in terms of back selling the higher amount of bankruptcies this year? David Simon : Well, let me first address in terms of our renewals. We are right on pace on our \u201918 renewals today as where we were in \u201917 with our renewals. And we as David indicated we're still seeing a relatively strong volume coming in. We have a large portfolio and as we work through we have to a degree a lumpier process because we deal with our tenants on all their expirations. So it's a little lumpier, but we do not expect that we're going to have any significant diminution in activity this year as compared to last year as we saw our average rents were up and our spreads were around. Michael Bilerman : Going back to the same-store NOI David, on page 19 you lay out pretty clearly that components of that growth and so are you going to not provide that information now that you're not providing the guidance from comparable and a total perspective? David Simon : No, no, no, that number will be the same. I mean that page will be the same and I've provided, somebody asked me the question I provided the same guidance we provided last year, so we've given you the guidance. And that page will continue to be the same and we'll continue to report both same-store and portfolio NOI we just are trying to explain to you we think one's better than the other. But you'll get both numbers and you'll be able to decide what's relevant. Michael Bilerman : Right, and I guess the question is just trying to define slightly and people, different people may have different views the spread this year between comparable and total was 130 basis points. I don't know, if 130 that\u2019s again more\u2026 David Simon : All right well, okay, I mean we don't have to get into semantics too much, but it's fine Mike well our \u2013 we expected to be above 2% in same-store but it, but again our business is, it's a little bit more difficult to and again we thought we'd be at 3% last year and we beat it. We like to beat our numbers as you know. We have again another unrivaled history on that, you know, an unrivaled earnings growth, unrivaled dividend growth, unrivaled balance sheet, also unrivaled beating earnings expectations. And obviously as you - and Tom and I spent a lot of time looking at comp NOI over a long, short periods of times, long period of time and it's safe to say we've outperformed that both from a complete real estate point of view as well as within the retail sector. So put all that aside, we would hope to continue to do that, but it's a little \u2013 you know our business is not as - it's a little bit more of an art and science just more levers, a little bit like the hotel business as opposed to say the office business or even the apartment business. So that's why we always try to guide you towards this kind of range as opposed to that kind of range because there is all lot more moving pieces then some of those others. But it's expected to be about 2% and our portfolio NOI is expected to be about 3% and that's exactly what we told you last year and we'll provide the same. I think you'll find page 19 helpful, is it Michael. Michael Bilerman : It is. David Simon : We will continue to provide page 19. Michael Bilerman : And then just a strategic question, as you think about running a company a lot of times status quo has more risk in it and pursuing some sort of transaction de-risks the company in some ways and you think about your history in terms of going into the outlet business, buying mills, expanding internationally, spinning off WPG in each of those the resulting entity was stronger, relative to the status quo. And I'm just curious how you think about the status quo today in terms of your three divisions and your geographical exposure and you can translate a little bit of what Unibail is doing with Westfield right? They have a status quo of being a predominately European, French focused company may have had more risk and diversifying their entity into the U.S. small business to them was the attractiveness wealth of the status quo. So how do you think about the go forward as Simon sit here today in terms of having those three divisions in your geographical exposure? David Simon : Well, I would say we are without question in my opinion perfectly positioned to continue the success that we've had over the last 20 plus years. So there is absolutely nothing that I think we are not appropriately position for future opportunities. We don't, I don't feel - the only thing I feel compelled to do is to make our existing real estate better. That I feel with a complete unmitigated, unrestrained passion. I also think we need to without question work our tails off to figure out how to connect with the consumer in lots of different ways. But I certainly don't feel that we need to be better positioned or that I'm losing out on the M&A activity. I just don't, I don't beat to that drum and I don't think we need to and in fact I think most people are catching up with what we've already done, so I don't get out that I don't worry about. I worry about absolutely making our existing real estate better and I worry about how we continue to want to connect with the consumer and we'll always find interesting things to do. I mean, the market Michael, you know we gloss over what we do, but we did open an outlet in Kuala Lumpur okay? We do have a great presence and I don't think anybody other than tab and I guess has a presence in China. We do have an international business. We do have diversity in product type. We do have a great balance sheet. Our people are good at what they do. I'm not that shabby. So I don't know, I think we're okay, but the passion here is how do we make our existing real estate better and if there's external deal to do that we think is opportunistic for our shareholders then we'll take advantage of it. But I don't, I really, really, don't feel compelled that we have to do that to continue our leadership position. That's right, I don\u2019t feel that all that. I will say this, I mean I think these folks are catching up with us. We'll see if they are successful. I've lived and breathed this. It isn't that easy, it not - it doesn't happen, well you're going from a piece of paper to cash flow is a different leap of faith and so we'll see. Michael Bilerman : And how do you feel just about your appeal, you obviously have the stake in [indiscernible] to [indiscernible] a number of years ago. There's been some M&A activity in that marketplace. How do you sort of feel about owning a 20% stake in the public security, you're chairman of the supervisory board with a lot of control, but just, how do you sort of think about Europe in that context with activity going on there as well and what you could do? David Simon : Well, listen I think we bought opportunistically as you know that it's interesting Europe. They're all excited about the growth there that's finally catching up with the U.S. I am very comfortable with our investment there. And what the job, they're doing we've done a lot with that company. We'll continue to make it better, but again I don't feel from that standpoint that they are missing out some of these M&A activities the shareholders of the acquirer you know are pretty much beyond if not puke and it's somewhere in between. Right? So we at Klepierre have a lot - I think a lot to continue to do to improve the company and they're doing a very good job of it and I feel very comfortable with that investment and I'm pleased to see that there's, that there's green shoots in France and their starting to growth and the entrepreneurial spirit is coming back to an area that truly needs and deserves it. Michael Bilerman : Great, well I appreciate all the color and keep growing cash flow. David Simon : Yes, that\u2019s what we do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question about sales. Curious about actually the 2% sales growth to the fourth quarter, is there anything positive I think the fourth consecutive quarter of sales just were include growth. But most are a bit surprised that sales per square foot worked up a little bit higher. After all you had pretty easy comps given to on '16 week holiday season last year and the fourth quarter I think you did -1%. So adding that plus all the hype around how great to see holiday season was from the media. May be you can reconcile that and add a bit more color on which categories maybe weighed down your growth and maybe some of the out performers? David Simon : Well, this is, I mean the number is, the number is that the retailers report to us. They're in the retail business there's always winners and losers every quarter. There's no extraordinary insights that I have that will help you, help me answer that question. And I don\u2019t know Rick if you, the numbers to number is all I could tell you, but Rick if you have some insights. Richard Sokolov : The only thing I can tell you is that just in terms of categories the entertainment women's better and moderate and kids' shoes were better, regions of the mountain at Atlantic Pacific and Florida were stronger. I think again reflecting the point that David made earlier that tourism is back a little bit and I agree with David, our sales number is a derivative number from our retailers. We're certainly doing everything in our power to draw more people to our properties, but ultimately the retailers have to convert them once we get them there. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, fair enough I appreciate that color Rick and perhaps do you guys also have a NOI weighted sales per square foot growth figure year-over-year? I'm trying to get a sense of\u2026? David Simon : Whatever that number that we had last time, I don't know, and Tom can follow up. Thomas Ward : Yes, it\u2019s in fact it's up a little higher than it was, it was up almost 2.4%. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, thank you for that. And one more I guess on the transaction market, I\u2019m curious if you're maybe think few more assets in the marketplace, have you noticed that change in perhaps seller sentiment for the quality assets that you want, given the recent transaction marks provided. And I guess understanding not, that you're watching but not necessary intern participating in the M&A going on around you. Is it fair to assume that you are interested in high assets should they become available? I guess what I'm trying to figure out you have as you outlined 8 billion-ish of liquidity, 2 billion of cash what you're planning to do with it? Thanks. Richard Sokolov : Well, I mean I kind of, we work kind of hard to build that up, so I mean it's - I view it as an opportunity not and I said look, I think at the end of the day. We're going to be focused on good real estate in terms of our external activity. We're going to be focused on good real estate that we could add value to priced right and if we can't find that, we won't buy it. And if you look at our track record, we've done that. So let me repeat, good real estate one, two is where we can add value and three is appropriately priced for us and somebody may have pricing view that's different than ours and we may be right or we may be wrong. The only thing I can point you to is our track record and I will assure you that every time that we did an M&A deal, we were wildly criticized from CPI to when the Barlow was so long ago and I mean people remember, right? I barely remember it. I mean\u2026 David Simon : And suddenly Rick showed up at the office one day and I go, how did you get here? Richard Sokolov : But you know, CPI to buying Chelsea to buying Chelsea to buying the Mills, I mean that was not one deal that the market said, boy, you guys got a good chance. So now that the concern is we're not buying anything, it is what it is. We find those three metrics we'll do something. If we don't, we won't. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, I appreciate the thoughts, but disconnecting the dots it sounds like there isn't anything more incremental in the marketplace that perhaps you're noticing a shift in sentiment or perhaps a change in the quantity of quality assets available? David Simon : Well, look I think the good news for you are a market participant and the good news for you is that you've had a couple of companies that are obviously very thoughtful smart companies from Brookfield to Unibail that have given you a mark, Unibail has given you a great mark in terms of you want to value U.S. real estate. And I know the market really was dying for that and there it shows up. Yet, it's not enough. Okay? But I would say to you that's a pretty healthy mark, if you're looking at wanting to understand what existing pricing is today. Thomas Ward : Okay, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vincent Chao : Hey, good morning everyone. May be just a follow up question on this liquidity. You talked about firepower quite a bit and the strength of the balance sheet, but regardless of what the investment is whether share buybacks or M&A at some point in the future or developments, I guess how comfortable are you in taking up your leverage? It sounds like you think you're not getting the credit for your leverage, that some of your similarly rated peers are, so and then I guess would you be comfortable going to 6.5, 7? David Simon : Well, I don't was to pick a number on, but I would encourage you to look at who is rated the same as us in the retail space and look at - it to me the most, nominal line guy, I'm so old that I ice go cold, private equity leverage buyouts okay, that's the pure definition of how old you are right, whether you say private equity or leveraged buyouts. I\u2019d encourage you, Vincent to look at this in retail real estate really look at debt-to-EBITDA ours versus the peers rated in our category and you can see there's a wide really shockingly big spread. So we're trying to assess that, what does that mean for us or why is it that way we don't have really good answers and so it's a work in progress, but we're paying attention to it. There shouldn't be that big a spread. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks and then I think we've touched on this in the past, but of the $1.2 million square feet that you referenced from 2017 bankruptcies, how much of that is expected to come back on line in 2018? David Simon : We\u2019ve already brought back on line almost 50% of it and we're making really good progress on the balance and the tenants that are coming in are frankly great productive growing tenants that are going to be more productive in the tenants that closed and they're paying higher rents. So it is a very productive process, but it certainly does have an impact while we're going through. Vincent Chao : Got it and just one last one just in terms of your contractual rent bumps, what is that currently on average for the portfolio? David Simon : In terms of what we're doing in our leases? Vincent Chao : Right. David Simon : Typically they are 3% Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Rich Hill : Hey good morning. I think this question is for David and Rick maybe together. From our perspective and I think probably yours as well, the retail narrative was really strong in 4Q with sales improving. So I was a little bit surprised to see overage rents, look to be down maybe around 13% year-over-year and I was wondering if there's anything that maybe drove that you had mentioned Puerto Rico being closed in the fourth quarter. David Simon : So, yes the simple answer is yes. Puerto Rico we did have overage rent from Puerto Rico that we have to take out, but also remember that. And you see this in our average base rent going up, so it's our job to take that overage rent each and every year when leases rollover to put that in the minimum rent, right? So you know, as the lease rolls are over let's say they\u2019re paying $10 of base rent, $10 of overage rent it's our job to get that to 20 bucks at base rent, right so we can take out the volatility. So part of our job is to always even do that and in a robust sales environment historically you've had folks that even though we've eaten into their overage with increases in base rent, there's a whole slew of others but since sales have been kind of flattish over the last couple years you're seeing the impact more of us converting the overage into the base rent and you're seeing that in the average base rent increase. Rich Hill : Got it. That type of the numbers that's all I have. Thank you very much. David Simon : Yes, no worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is now open. Nicholas Yulico : Hi everyone. Couple questions on occupancy, in the third quarter you mentioned you had a 30 basis point negative drag on total occupancy from new centers, what was that impact in the fourth quarter? David Simon : Similar. Nick Yulico : Okay, so I\u2019m just trying to understand why the year-over-year occupancy dropped more in the fourth quarter than third quarter? David Simon : We processed a lot of bankruptcies in the fourth quarter. Again remember they tell you when they're going to close and just a function of the bankruptcy processing. Nick Yulico : Okay and then just lastly on in terms of your occupancy I guess in the fourth quarter and over the past year, hoping to get a break down of long term versus short term tenants and how that trend has changed in the past year? David Simon : It's the way, our definition is that it is hasn't changed, so the numbers are the numbers. Okay? We only include it if it\u2019s a year. And then if it's less and it is not in our numbers, so it's all in it's a year-over-year comparison is appropriate the number hasn't changed or the definition hasn\u2019t unchanged. Nick Yulico : Okay, thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is now open. Floris van Dijkum : David, a quick question for you on, sort of touching upon fall off on other questions you've had as well, but with the Westfield comp out there at a relatively low cap rate compared to where consensus is for eight more guys there seems to be 75 basis points certainly relative to where you're trading at today, why aren't you more aggressive or will you become does that make you become more aggressive about share buybacks heading into \u201918? David Simon : Well, first of all you can't buy stock back in a blackout period unless you have a - what's the word I\u2019m looking for? 10B5 okay. So and you said guidelines on the 10B5, so unless those guidelines are met we can't buy it, but the reality is, I think I intimated that yes it's something we're thinking more and more about. Floris van Dijkum : Okay, another question I had regarding your 12 Sears boxes that you now control. Presumably there not in your redevelopment pipeline as you mentioned earlier. David Simon : Well, that presumably they\u2019re not, they're not, you can take out the word presumably. Floris van Dijkum : Right, there not, no but I\u2019ll ask as but presumably the returns on those 12 boxes would be in excess of your overall portfolio and based on what certainly what [indiscernible] has been able to achieve on their space right now. Any ideas of or any advance thoughts on any of them that you can share in terms of maybe turning some of the space into enter small shop space or is it mostly going to be doing your anchors, how you\u2026? David Simon : Yes, it's a legitimate question. It's all over the board. As these transactions are permitted and approved internally, then you'll see exactly and it will be some are just box for box. A lot of them are torn down and redo like what we did in Macau and Texas. And like what we're going to do with King of Prussia with Penny or like what we're going to do with the bulk [ph] department store at Phipps. So it's really all over the board and we'll obviously, for us as we get all of that done permitted, priced out, approved, that will flow into our 8K and you\u2019ll see exactly specifically what we're going to do there. Floris van Dijkum : Okay, great thanks. Last question I guess is, maybe if you can make a comment broadly on TIs. I think one of the concerns that people have its TI packages certainly in some of the script companies but also in some of the other mall companies has been raising a little bit. Are you seeing any sort of trends there in terms of what you're having to offer your tenants? David Simon : If you go back over our TIs over the last five or six years, they've been in a very tight range. So I think it's important we very rarely give any TIs on renewals it's only for new leasing activities when we have a slightly elevated TIs because we've been able to do more restaurants or design your tenants, but it's been in a very tight range and we're not seeing any material increase in what we need to give tenants in that area. Floris van Dijkum : Great thanks. That\u2019s it from me. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is now open. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Good morning. Following up on Floris\u2019s question on the future Sears redevelopments are you thinking about these spaces any differently as in would you be less interested in letting apparel tenants fill the boxes, just given how competitive the space remains even if some brands had a better holiday? Richard Sokolov : We are focused on making our properties better. As David said we've got very defined plans for all 12 of these. We are far down the road in our approval and leasing process. We have apparel tenants, we have restaurants, we have mixed used elements. We've got boxes, health clubs, theaters all over the board, but in every instance there is one thing each of these projects has been common and that is when we're done our project is going to be substantially stronger, higher NOI, higher total sales and more attractive marketplace serving its trade area. Linda Tsai : Thanks. This probably sounds minor, but the occupancy cost ratio increased to 13.2% where as it's been it was it's been in the 13% to 13.1% range for the past several quarters is there anything to highlight here? David Simon : No. Linda Tsai : Okay. David Simon : No, it's immaterial really. Linda Tsai : All right and then what was traffic like in the quarter at the Mills versus the Malls, versus the Premium Outlets. David Simon : All generally positive enough and I think traffic and sales are painting a more robust picture than the narrative out there is suggesting. Linda Tsai : Have you seen some of that traffic follow through in January? David Simon : Yes, I think January has been a very well it's anecdotal, we don't have January sales, yet it's we get from the retailers 20 days after the month but anecdotally we hear January is very strong across the board. So again, I mean I wouldn't bank on that, but that's at least from a anecdotal point of view we're hearing that. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey guys question for Rick, I just wonder if you could talk about the pace of activity or momentum kind of in the junior box space some of the fashion retirees that have been a huge focus here in recent years. It seems to be losing a little bit of steam, so just wondering what the pipeline looks like on that front relative to maybe a year ago? Richard Sokolov : Yes, it's in fact very strong ironically if you look at 12, 31, 16 we indicated we were going to have 34 boxes that could open in \u201917 and beyond and in fact in \u201917 we opened 34 and we now have 40 additional ones on the schedule for 18 and beyond. So there is still a very robust market out there for our properties and as we have said in the past, you're seeing that in our portfolio. Tenants that are operating in the mall contacts and than have operated in the power center contact which we can provide better sales, better traffic, so robust pipeline that is continuing to grow. Jeremy Metz : All right, I appreciate that and then just one quick point of clarity here in Puerto Rico and I know it\u2019s not hugely material impact nearly $12 of earnings this sounds like guidance includes no insurance recovery, but the continuation of that call it $0.03 quarter we had from loss income, so is that the right way to look at it, so $0.12 drag in 2018 more or less? David Simon : Well, it\u2019s I don't want to really point to that because we've got actually collected, so we're still projecting kind of a tough environment in Puerto Rico, so not completely the end of the world there, but we've got the properties are slowly opening, so it's I would say the drag is in the $0.03, $0.04, range somewhere in that range, but there's still a drag but where in fact Puerto Rico outlets just open that's further along and then the mall is it's getting closer to getting up to where it was. I mean it's open as well, but there's still a number of tenants lagging, so we still have some drag there and then we can't really book that be until we get it so it's dilutive to where we would be if we didn't have the hurricane but that's kind of the number in that range that's hurting us absent that. Jeremy Metz : Okay, thanks guys. David Simon : Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. So you guys talked about better traffic sales and maybe overall better mood across the industry. When you think about your guidance for next year are . Are to better malls in your portfolio improving versus last year or is a bottom picking back up, I was wondering if you can provide a little more color on that? David Simon : It is across the board, but obviously our stronger properties are getting incrementally stronger and growing a little better and that hasn't changed in 50 years. Ki Bin Kim : Okay and what is the average vintage of leases that are coming due in 2018? And how you describe you know what happens after the value of vintage starts to wear off going forward, and what is that kind of your\u2026? David Simon : I don't know the reference damage. I mean we provide you the expiring rents and I think that gives you a pretty good road map when you compare our average base rent of leases that are expiring with our opening rents that we use in our spreads, so it shows you we still have for the next seven or eight years considerable runway to be able to roll our rent based on what we're doing to that. Ki Bin Kim : Yes, I mean there's a little bit of discrepancy and understanding that because I believe the expiring are exclusive of cam, so it's not exactly comparable, versus what you're signing, but if you compare the average base renI personally are signing but\u2026? David Simon : No, but if you compare the average base rent expiring and our average base rent today that has all of the lower rents, we're still our average base rent today is still an excess of our expiring rents. Ki Bin Kim : All right, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. David Simon : Okay, thank you ma'am. Oh thank you and again we apologize for the length of our calls, but we want to have everybody given the opportunity to ask whatever questions that they do. So I do apologize and also later than people want, but that's why we're here happy to answer questions, so thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good morning, everybody. We\u2019re pleased to report a strong start to the year. Retailers are performing better following a strong holiday season and decent start to the year. Demand is picking up for our space and traffic and sales are up. We continue to invest in our product with a long-term view of creating compelling, integrated environments or consumers to live, work, stay, play, and of course shop. We completed several significant redevelopment projects, are under construction on others, and announced more activity that will further enhance the value of our real estate and grow our cash flow. And we continue to identify unique, strategic, new development opportunities globally, that will extend our reach and create world-class destinations. Before I turn to the results of the quarter, I would like to provide some perspective. First, we expect to generate in excess of $4 billion in earnings this year, that\u2019s FFO. There are only 40 companies in the S&P 100 that are projected to generate over $4 billion in earnings this year and have an A rated balance sheet. Simon is one of them. Second, we expect to distribute approximately $3 billion in dividends this year, which would make us one of the top 40 dividend paying companies in the entire world and country and obviously, in the S&P 100. Finally, our stock is trading at a 12 times multiple, which is a 30% discount to our historical average multiple of approximately 18 times. This is the lowest multiple SPG has traded at over the last eight years, despite compound annual growth rate of more than 11% in earnings and 14% in dividends over that period of time. And as you know, our numbers speak for themselves. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.87 per share, an increase of 4.7% compared to the prior year and exceeding the first call consensus estimates by $0.04 per share. This marks the first time we generated in excess of $1 billion of FFO in the quarter. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.8% or more than $70 million in the quarter and our comp NOI increased 2.3% for the quarter. And as you remember, and I want to reiterate, they do not include lease settlement income. Linking activity remained solid, continues to improve. Average base minimum rent was $50 -- $53.54, up 3.3% compared to last year. The mall only outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.45 per foot, an increase of 12.6%. And we are pleased that retail sales momentum continued to pick up in the first quarter. In fact, each of our platforms posted record sales productivity for the period. Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and premium outlets was $641 compared to $615 in the prior year period, an increase of 4.2%. As a reminder, this sales metric is based on information reported by the retailers. As a point of reference, while reported retail sales grew a strong 4%. We know there are significant number of retailers who are underreporting their sales number because they\u2019re deducting returns of online sales that were not previously reported as store sales. This is not allowed under our leases. Although we plan to continue to provide reported retailer sales, it is important for the investment community to understand. We believe this metric is understated. Our malls and outlets ended the quarter at 94.6%. Occupancy is down compared to last year due to timing of the bankruptcies processed last year and the first quarter of this year, as well as the addition of new space brought on line last year that is slightly lower than the overall average for the quarter. On an NOI-weighted basis for our operating metrics were as follows. Reported retail sales on an NOI-weighted basis is $804 per foot compared to $641. And again, this number we believe is still understated. Occupancy is 95.6% compared to 94.6%. And average base minimum rent is $70.34 compared to $53.54. Just to turn to new development. In Edmonton, Canada, the Premium Outlet Collection will open next Wednesday, May 2nd, marking our fourth outlet center in Canada. Construction continues on four additional new outlets, Denver, Colorado opening in December; Queretaro, Mexico, which will open in December; Malaga, Spain, which will open in the spring of \u201819; and Cannock, United Kingdom, which will open in the spring of 2020. We have development -- redevelopment expansion projects underway at nearly 30 of our properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally, and we continuously evaluate our portfolio for additional opportunities. During the quarter, 175,000 square-foot expansion, opened at Aventura Mall, one of the most productive retail centers in the U.S. During the quarter, we started construction on a significant redevelopment at Southdale; we\u2019re replacing a former JCPenney box with a Life Time Athletic, Life Time Sports and Work, specialty shops, restaurants, 146-room Homewood Suites, as well as the Restoration Hardware and Shake Shack restaurant. We\u2019re also working through the entitlement process for our transformative redevelopment projects of the former department store spaces at Phipps, Plaza and at King of Prussia. Phipps has started construction KoP will start we hope by the end of the year. Lastly, we announced our plans to redevelop five locations, five Sears locations Brea, Burlington, Midland, Ocean and Ross Park Mall. Each of these projects has unique plans dependent upon the needs of the communities in which they are located, including entertainment, fitness, dining halls, restaurants, residential, hotel, office and of course new to market retailers. These are all go projects. Our industry-leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us. During the quarter our A/A2 unsecured credit ratings were firm with the stable outlook by S&P and by Moody\u2019s, respectively. And by the way, similar A and A2 rated companies in our sector do not come close to our financial characteristics. However, it is what it is. We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with the lower pricing grid for five years. And we closed and are committed on six mortgages, totaling 513 for roughly five years at 3.4% interest. Keep in mind, we have no unsecured senior notes or consolidated secured debt maturing for the remainder of this year and little for 2019. Net debt to NOI was 5.5 times. Our coverage was 5 times. Only 6% of our total variable -- of our debt is variable. Our liquidity is more than $7 billion. And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $228 million. We announced our dividend of a $1.95 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 11.4%. We\u2019re increasing our FFO guidance from $11.95 to $12.05 per share. This represents approximately 6.5% to 7.5% growth compared to reported FFO of $11.21 per share for 2017. To conclude, strong start to the year. We expect to generate $1.5 billion in excess cash flow, which will allow us to fund our new development, redevelopment, execute on our share repurchase authorization or decrease our leverage, which is already significantly below our peer group. We welcome and encourage your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steve Sakwa : Hi. Just a couple of quick things here. So, it looks like a lot of the operating metrics have pointed up in the right direction, leasing spreads improving, sales improving. I know occupancy can bounce around and there has been some store closures and a few bankruptcies, but I also know that some of the new developments that are brought on line tend to kind of pull that number down. So, I was wondering if you or Rick could just first share, how much of the 100 basis-point occupancy decline was maybe development related and then, how much of it was natural store closings or bankruptcies. David Simon : Well, I would say, over the majority is related to bankruptcies. And remember, Steve, we are very focused on putting the right tenant in the right space. And when a -- we\u2019re at the mercy of bankruptcy court. So, the reality is, you file Chapter 11, you can reject the lease at any time, and as you know, the build-out and getting the space leased takes some time. We do expect that we will get back to where we were last year, maybe a little bit better. But again, that will depend upon if there are a little bit more bankruptcies or not. So, it\u2019s pretty much what we expected. Remember, as we gave guidance, we thought we would get back to where we are. We\u2019re processing the bankruptcies. And then, I would say, I don\u2019t know, 20, 30 basis points are probably just the new space that we\u2019ve added on, so in that range of 70-30, somewhere in that range. Steve Sakwa : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Secondly, it\u2019s a little more of a housekeeping item. But, we noticed on the other income that you had a large jump in interest dividend and distribution income. I think, the lease settlement income sort of speaks for itself. But, can you just provide any color on what the large jump was in the quarter and is that recurring or is that just a one-time number. David Simon : It is recurring. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t know when it recurs. So, that is basically the distribution we get from our interest in value retail. And so, it does manifest itself. Just so you know, I know a little bit about accounting. So, we cost account for that. We do not equity account. And so, when you cost account, you basically only record cash. That happens to be a cash distribution. And it does happen. It\u2019s happened every year for the last several years. It is lumpy. And that\u2019s what it was from. We\u2019ve put that in that line item because it\u2019s technically a distribution. Now, that\u2019s a function of -- it\u2019s cash flow, refinancing activity, I mean, it all goes into a pot there. But, we cost account for that. And then, we only book it when we receive the actual cash. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. And then, just last for me, just share repurchase. I know you didn\u2019t do anything in the fourth quarter, but you obviously took advantage in the first quarter. How should we just think about your buyback activity over the course of the year? David Simon : I think, it\u2019s going to continue at these levels. We are -- if you look at our balance sheet, you look at very little exposure to potential rising rates, the underperformance of our stock price, the kind of the mood is getting better, retail demand increasing. Market\u2019s now recognizing it, why not buy stock back. So, I think, we will continue that. I think, just like anything else, like we typically do, we will be cautious about it. But, it\u2019s certainly in our plans. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, David. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Two questions. The first, in your shareholders letter, you talked about the fifth platform being focused on the consumer. And I was wondering if you can delve a little bit deeper into the resources that you\u2019re committing to that. How you\u2019re going to measure success? How much capital you want to put forth that I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re thinking grander of like what Westfield did with Westfield Labs and OneMarket. And I know, there\u2019s a lot of different things that you\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019s a Snapchat the Family app, the Facebook, Happy Returns, all these things that you\u2019re trying to get together with the consumer but you can delve a little bit deeper into how you envision that going forward? David Simon : Well, at this point, given what\u2019s going on, I really don\u2019t have a lot for sure, other than we\u2019re dedicating resources and efforts to it. I hope to have something to talk to the market about later in the year. I wouldn\u2019t compare it to whatever it\u2019s called one labs, Westfield Labs, I\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s all about. We\u2019re actually working on this right now. We think about it all the time. We are a retail real estate company. But, we have the flexibility to think about other investments and other ways that technology can improve our consumer experience without jeopardizing basically the core business. And that\u2019s a huge focus for the Company. As you know, our -- even though Tom wanted me to take it out of my letter, I did hit to the market kind of what are marketing connection to the consumer brings every year; it\u2019s in the letter. Thank you for reading the letter, first of all. And I mean, it\u2019s real money. You capitalize it. It\u2019s a real business, depending on how you want to capitalize that. I think, we have this huge connection to the consumer, 100 million consumers, 2 billion visits a year. So, a lot\u2019s going on there. But, I\u2019m not really ready to get granular with you but I hope to do it by the end of this year. Michael Bilerman : But, is that something that you feel like you want to go and acquire something or is it all being built and investing in-house? David Simon : Right now, we\u2019re building but I wouldn\u2019t rule out strategic investment at all. We just -- right now, it\u2019s tough for us to make any investment. So, you look at how those values are compared to our values. But there are -- we have a tremendous amount of optionality on how to continue to grow our business because of the position that we\u2019re in. So, we\u2019ll continue to look at everything under the hood. As you know, we make investments through our venture group. There could be larger; we\u2019ve tended to make those kind of relatively small investments, but there could be larger investments. We\u2019re building something right now that I think will be very interesting. And that\u2019s the thing that I\u2019m referring to that I hope to -- they view by at least by the end of this year, but as you know, when you\u2019re building something, it\u2019s always a little -- it\u2019s not quite like building a mall but there a lot of analogies to it. Christy McElroy : Hey, David. It\u2019s Christy here, just a quick one for me. It seems like the property expense recovery rate was down in the quarter from recent trends. Just wondering if there was anything onetime in there and how we should be thinking about the property level expenses going forward. David Simon : Not really. First quarter had no -- had utility expenses, there were -- it was a little bit -- we had a little bit of spike up in those. We\u2019re also adding some properties to it, so that those numbers tend to go, but basically, our utility expenses and snow expenses. As you know, the spring is not sprung yet. Maybe it\u2019s springing right now as we speak. So it\u2019s really more of that. I wouldn\u2019t read anything else into that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Rich Hill : Hey. Good morning, David. Maybe a quick question for you. One of the things that we were looking at was maybe a little bit of increase in the month to month leases. It looks like they increased to around 3.5 million square feet versus around 1.6 million square feet. I recognize that\u2019s still small overall. But, I\u2019d be curious if you could give us any color as to whether that\u2019s timing related, the change in strategy. How you\u2019re thinking about that? David Simon : When you get bankrupt space back, you wait for the right tenant. It\u2019s really just typically part of our strategy here that we are looking at the regional local markets a little bit more in detail. So, we tend to do those a little bit shorter-term sometimes. But, it\u2019s really just a function of us recycling our portfolio through. Now, remember, in our occupancy, we only include leases that are over a year. So, the 94.6 just concludes; that doesn\u2019t include like short-term leasing that is just three, six months. But, all of that is about a year. Rick Sokolov : The only thing I would add is that we\u2019re maximizing our revenue. So, we go out of our way and try and make sure that we have as much space occupied for as long as we can. And we\u2019re also able to incubate tenants out of that program. We got a number of tenants that have started with us temporary tenants which in fact end up going longer term leases because they find they can make money and like the experience. Rich Hill : And can you remind me, maybe going back to Christy\u2019s comment here a little bit. Do those month-to-month leases pay reimbursements or is it just like typical lease\u2026 David Simon : Yes. And remember, a lot of those month to months are leases that we haven\u2019t finalized the negotiation with. So, we tend to take a big retailer. Okay? Maybe they\u2019re headquartered in San Francisco, and I won\u2019t name names. Believe it or not, just because of the two organizations back and forth, we may not have those leases negotiated completely. So, they are not going to leave and then come back. So, those tend to go month-to-month. And what you\u2019re looking at in the 8-K is essentially that backlog. So, you need to differentiate between short-term leasing and month-to-month. Month-to-month is basically our total book of business that we have many national retailers in \u201818 that are done. And those tend to be done throughout \u201818. Even though we try to get them all done, we may have a strategy not to get them all done for all sorts of reasons. So, I think you need to separate those two out. Those month-to-month are primarily national retailers that have just not been finalized and they go. And remember a lot of our leases expire at January 31. So, a lot of reasons don\u2019t get -- believe it or not, don\u2019t get done until May and June. And don\u2019t ask me but that\u2019s been year after year after year. So, I hope you understand the difference. Rich Hill : No, I believe. David Simon : Let me repeat. So, you see in the 8-K is mostly vast majority of national tenants that we have finalized our deals, they automatically go to month-to-month, in our 94.6 only leases that are a year older in that number. Operator : Thank you our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. We see that you\u2019re continuing to ramp up your densification pipeline. I was just wondering, as you look out your portfolio, how many projects you think you could be pursuing a densification effort on? It seems primarily hotels have been your densification effort of choice. Do you see more office and resi efforts as you densify? David Simon : Yes. I would say to you that just off the top of my head, we have at least 20 major projects, one of which is under construction. Now, we have to move the fire station at Phipps. But Phipps is a great example where we\u2019re building a hotel with Nobu and a restaurant and an office building. There is no residential there. But as you know, we already built residential in our development there. But, we have a lot of residential. So, like -- and Craig you know the portfolio. So, Stoneridge and the East Bay, significant amount of resi will be part of the Sears redevelopment; same thing with Brea in Orange County. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s mostly hotel. The reality is I think, you\u2019ll see more and more resi built. And just a gross number, at least 20 but we\u2019re building a hotel and Sawgrass. I mean, it\u2019s all over the board, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re excited about, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re dedicating more obviously capital, but also human resources toward. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then, regarding Bon-Ton, maybe you could share some of your future plans for the repurposing efforts of those department stores. David Simon : I\u2019ll let Rick speak, other than Bon-Ton is a nonmaterial event for us. We\u2019ve already got users identified. Again, we don\u2019t own all of the real estate. So, some of it will be out of our hands, at least for some period of time. But Rick, you can add to that. David Simon : We basically have already identified users for virtually every one of the stores. And as David said, there are some that we own that we\u2019re moving aggressively on right now; there are some that Bon-Ton owns, some that are third-party owned. But, we have users. They have said yes, let\u2019s make finalize economics. And we would hope to have information about that later in the year. The stores aren\u2019t going to even come back till third quarter while they finish their process. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Just two just questions from us. First, David, in your opening comments, you referenced internet returns and how you make sure that the tenants aren\u2019t understating their sales. Could you just expand on that? As far -- it sounds like you guys get a full detailed P&L and somehow you\u2019re able to double check to make sure that the retailers, the tenants are leaving off anything to further understate. But, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on that. David Simon : Well, there is not much to elaborate other than we actually don\u2019t get P&Ls, we get -- we have audit rights. And in our normal procedure, we saw some anomalies about sales. And as we\u2019ve gone through our audit rights despite the retailer has audit rights on us in some cases. Now, if you go back historically, it used to be all these CAM audits. But, since we all went to fix CAM, that\u2019s less of an issue. We found out that there -- what\u2019s fascinating to me about the internet and it\u2019s never really discussed is everyone talks about the internet\u2019s gross sales, they never talk about the net sales. And I think by and large, bricks and mortar are -- because as you know apparel 30% to 40% returns and I think most of those returns are occurring in a lot of cases in the physical world, which is good for the retailers because maybe they are giving them credits or maybe they exchange it. But, we\u2019ve just found that we\u2019re getting dinged by the internet return when fact they are not allowed to because the reality is the only thing they are allowed to offset in terms of sales is returns from the store. And in many cases, we limit the total returns they are allowed to net against us. So, this is an issue. I mean I don\u2019t want to make a big deal about it. But, when the market is fascinated by sales per square foot, we just think we need to tell you the other side of the story. What happens here and how it gets dealt with is anybody\u2019s guess. It\u2019s surely part of our lease negotiation, but we just want to tell the market, we are giving you our reported sales and they are less than what\u2019s going on in that market because of the internet sales returns. And I can\u2019t quantify it but I do think I wouldn\u2019t tell you if they weren\u2019t material out that. How\u2019s that? Alexander Goldfarb : That\u2019s what I figured. The second question is, part of your redevelopment that you guys have been doing has also been upgrading the food courts, which I don\u2019t think usually get much attention. So, whether it\u2019s like Woodbury or Westchester, certainly it\u2019s pretty dramatic from what it was. But, as far as measuring return, like it\u2019s to say, hey, at a restaurant, we drive this much more NOI, this much traffic, you add new retailers, new hotel, you can judge that. How do you -- are the food courts really dramatically increasing sales in NOI or these are more just, hey, you got to upgrade it, make it look good, it\u2019s probably got the same sales that it was doing before. But if we\u2019re going to do with the center, we have to. So, is this more defensive spend or are you actually getting a good return when you\u2019re doing those? David Simon : Look, I think it\u2019s all. It\u2019s offense; it\u2019s defense. The reality is, those numbers are all in our numbers, so, however you want to look at it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that critical to say it\u2019s offense or defense. When we do make an investment in our food hall operations, that cost and that income that we get is all in the numbers that Tom provides in his 8-K. And just remember, and we don\u2019t talk about this, we\u2019ve been thinking about it, I\u2019ve been think about it. The 8-K we have here is just the approved projects, ready to go that we -- our own capital committees approved. It does not include our soon to be approved deals like a Phipps or all of the Sears redevelopment that we have to deal with at the end of year. And that\u2019s basically -- it\u2019s more than a shadow pipeline but it is significant amount of investment that we think we\u2019ll get accretive returns on. But, I would just say that simply, yes, it\u2019s both; it\u2019s offense, it\u2019s defense. The cost and the income from that is certainly in our numbers. And the world wants newness, healthy food, community place to hang out, all of the stuff that\u2019s really good. There\u2019s a lot of great operators. We need to do more and more of it. We\u2019re excited about it. Our peers have done it. They\u2019ve done a nice job with it. And I think it will continue to continue to move forward. Now, on some cases, we may take it out because the reality is, there\u2019s a better use for it. And each -- the thing about real estate is gather these trends, but the reality is it\u2019s got -- it boils down to the location, demographics, and all that stuff that makes real estate unique. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : This is Ki Bin. So, David, for a couple quarters, you\u2019ve mentioned that you think the retail demand or environment is getting better. So, what is it that you\u2019ve seen or you see it every day that that\u2019s not parent in the supplemental snapshot every quarter? David Simon : Well, we talk to our sales folks and they tell us demand\u2019s picking up. Now, leases take time. Bankruptcies don\u2019t take any time. Okay? So, they have a lease, they reject it. And then, we don\u2019t know if they are going to reject it or not; there\u2019s lots of games of chicken. But, we\u2019ve got one of the best leasing groups in the country. In the world, I look them in the eye; they tell me their demand is picking up. So, I talk to retailers, Rick talks to retailers. I mean, obviously, results are historical. They\u2019re not future expectations. We feel better about the business than in \u201817. We gave your judgment that bankruptcies would be less than 18. So, far we\u2019re right. We\u2019re not perfect in our estimates and judgments, but we\u2019ve been doing this a long time. And the guy that overseas leasing generally tells me green shoots. I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I wonder whether -- but John and I\u2019ve been working together a long time. I believe his judgment. Rick, you can comment on this. What do you think? Rick Sokolov : Interestingly, we have meetings every week with tenants where we\u2019re in their offices and they are coming in the Indianapolis and we\u2019re going over the portfolio. And that optimism is being generated out of those meetings where we are exposing opportunities to them. And where last year they would have said, we exposed 20 and they were interested in three and now they are interested in 12. So, there is definitely a more optimistic view; they more capital to spend and they are more focused on new opportunities than they were last year and that\u2019s because of our optimism. Ki Bin Kim : That\u2019s helpful. Is that just broad-based or is there a certain segment, it\u2019s a new type of tenants, is it the old guard? Just curious, how that looks like? David Simon : It\u2019s a combination. I mean, look at -- each company is different, but look at just from the gap look at Old Navy. They are growing the Old Navy business. Now, maybe they weren\u2019t two or three years ago. Obviously, the great thing about what\u2019s been going on in our industry is there are more and more entrepreneurs in the food and obviously in the retail front. You don\u2019t have to know -- I know, Rick -- this is usually where Rick updates his list. Let\u2019s move to call along and we\u2019ll avoid it. But, he\u2019s happy to give it to you. There are more folks. I mean, our new business group is doing new and new deals, new ideas. Our business always recycles itself; it\u2019s done it for so long. Our product has been around for 70 years. And despite -- and I don\u2019t want to blame -- I don\u2019t want to like being negative on the media. But, the media wants this one narrative, but it\u2019s just not reality. And look at our numbers, okay? We\u2019re going to make $4 billion this year. Okay? And that\u2019s -- yes, I mean, it\u2019s not perfect. I\u2019d love for everybody -- I\u2019d like not to have a slight decrease in occupancy and this, that and the other. But, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re in good shape. And I think the business generally is getting a little bit firmer. But, and again, and I go back and Tom might know it, but I wrote an article, my shareholder letter in \u201815 and I told you my concern about the leverage going into the system on retails. And the two big bankruptcies this year had basically -- Claire\u2019s had nothing to do with its operation. It\u2019s all about too much leverage. And Toys R Us, it was about the fact that it was so levered to begin with that they could never invest in the product, whether that\u2019s online or in the stores or anything, and the natural media narrative as well as the mall, well, it\u2019s not. Look at -- peel the onion, figure it out. And Tom, when did I write that in my letter, \u201815? Nobody reads my letter, but the reality is I told you about it in \u201815. So, that\u2019s where we try to explain it to you methodically. We show it, we back it up with our numbers. And every retail is different. But the reality is we just feel a little bit better than -- now easier you feel better when you don\u2019t have all these bankruptcies. But we\u2019re going to have some more. And no, I\u2019m not going to tell you which ones. And yes, some of it are because of operations or not -- the life has passed them by. But that\u2019s been going on in our business forever. Traffic is up, sales up, demand is up, and our numbers are catching up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : I just want to continue on your comments about getting better and retailer demand increasing. I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re seeing from your tenants in terms of reinvesting in their existing stores. Are you seeing encouraging activity here relative to maybe a year ago? Rick Sokolov : I think, our tenants that are now recognized being that they are only going to and be able to increase their share by giving the consumer a better environment. And Dave has been taking about that for the last quarters, asking our retailers to invest in the store. And we\u2019re seeing that more now. And that is in fact encouraging. One of the things that we\u2019re very focused on is right sizing our tenants. So, where we have a tenant that we believe is got too much space, we will work with them and reallocate that space, get them to a smaller store, it\u2019s more productive, we make money and we get back more space that we can lease to another productive tenant. And that\u2019s just like manufacturing new space without having to build it. And so, we\u2019re very focused on that. And the tenants are now more implying to work with us than they were in the last year or so. Jeremy Metz : Great, I appreciate that. And then, just switching gears in terms of those Sears boxes, the five redevelopments you recently announced the plans for, you mentioned earlier that those construction spend numbers aren\u2019t in the pipeline yet. But, given it sounds like those can be some pretty significant projects here, adding additional uses, the hotels, office, resi. Just wondering if you can give us any sort of sense of how much capital those five could total here. David Simon : Well, let me answer it this way. We\u2019ve made a deal with Sears to control 12 boxes. And when I say Sears, I should also mention Seritage. Our total investment in that -- now some of these are not this year, the five are this year because we\u2019re getting those back this year. But, the 12 in total is about $1.2 billion and that will flex little bit up and down. So, you should look at the total amount as opposed to the five. But, you\u2019ll see the five start coming into our 8-K. But, I would I say to you that you look at the 12 and it\u2019s about $1.2 billion altogether. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : I guess, also just on those densification projects, in the supplement, and I know another example is Northgate Mall outside of Seattle, which was in the news. That one mentioned it could have housing and offices but reduced square footage of retail. So, just wondering to what extent the project you\u2019re doing could involve a reduction of retail square footage so that even though the end result might be or should be an increase in NOI that there could be some decline in between? David Simon : Yes. There is no question that that will have a reduction in retail space. Because remember, we have Penny, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, and it\u2019s a tight size, but it\u2019s a great piece of real estate. And ultimately, it will be a residential, office and still retail. But, I\u2019d say, roughly retail would be cut in half, more or less, in that range. Obviously, this is a process over time. We\u2019ve got to go through the approval process, but the retail there will be dramatically reduced. Caitlin Burrows : I guess, when you think about the densification projects overall, is that normally the case, or more often is it like on a parking lot on the side that wouldn\u2019t end up impacting the retail portion? David Simon : Well, look, I think a lot of this is happening with our Sears stuff. So, if you consider Sears a retailer, in theory, it\u2019s taking that out. I mean all the 12 -- now, in a lot of cases we\u2019re just changing the mix, but it\u2019ll still be retail. So, I would say to you, a lot of it is reducing the department store, not so much the small shops, but really reducing the department store square footage and not the small shop. So, the income opportunity is really enhanced because as you know, either they pay very little rent or to buy the box on an accretive basis because getting small shop kind of rents or we\u2019re having mixed-use development. So, in a lot of cases, the retail will be reduced in total, but it\u2019ll be mostly department store reduction as opposed to what you and I would consider small shops. Rick Sokolov : And I would tell you that a great example of that focusing not just on the box, the land at King of Prussia, the Penny store is going to be demolished. That gives us 17 acres of land adjacent to King of Prussia mall and that is going to be a significant mixed-use project with hotel, office, residential, restaurants, retail, and amenities. And so, that\u2019s a major opportunity for us to substantially upgrade what is already one of the best properties in the United States. Caitlin Burrows : And then, just last one using Northgate or on this topic but just using Northgate as example, is the reason that\u2019s not listed yet just because the decision-making process is pretty early stage? David Simon : It\u2019s early. Listen, the critical path there\u2019s approvals. And then, once the approvals come, we\u2019ll start to build. So, it\u2019s a -- Seattle is obviously a great market and a great city. And this is a great piece of real estate. The new metro line is -- it basically comes off in our parking lot. But it\u2019s a multiyear process. I think, the most exciting that we\u2019ve got that the market could focus on, if they want say okay, what are you doing now would be Phipps. I mean, Phipps\u2019s Belk leaves August of this year. We demolish the store. It\u2019s a little complicated because we got to demolish the party and then go up. But that\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s basically -- we have this odd process here. I mean, it\u2019s basically -- they\u2019re finalizing all the numbers. But that will show up in either next quarter, closely thereafter. But it\u2019s for all intents and purposes a go deal. And it\u2019s roughly, if I remember right around, 350 million bucks. And it\u2019ll be accretive. And it is going to make that real estate just tremendous, fantastic. The only thing that could flex there is the office. But we think a brand new building there in that area with that parking and those amenities will be exciting. And we will be doing a new food hall there as along with the Life Time Work and Fitness and Sport, Nobu hotel restaurant. That\u2019s going to be the one you can say, well, this is great, you guys talk about this all but this is actually happening. Northgate\u2019s a year or so process. But the other big ones to look for are Brea, Stoneridge and obviously KoP. I mean, those are the big, what I say to you are the big four that are all going to be programmed in here in the next year or so. Caitlin Burrows : And then, just switching topics, the income and other taxes line item was historically an expense last year and the first quarter was positive, I think due to a loss from Aero this year, back to an expense. Just wondering if you could go through the impact Aeropostale had to your earnings this quarter and the outlook for that investment. David Simon : Well, last year -- I mean, this is the good news and the bad news. Last year -- as you know, the first quarter of retail operation usually loses, yes we had the tax benefit of that; this year, because of the lower tax and the operations are better, we had less of the tax benefit. And that\u2019s really what it manifests itself. I think, Aero business generally is, they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re supposed to do. So, that\u2019s a business that with a little elbow grease a less worry about comp sales and all this other stuff. I think we\u2019re going to -- our operating business will -- should have an EBITDA -- and again, we only own 49%, but should have an EBITDA, I don\u2019t know o $35 million. And we bought it basically one times EBITDA. So, I don\u2019t know, people criticize me for it. But, somehow it\u2019s working out. And as you know, they\u2019re going to take on the Nautica operations. We think that\u2019s another unique thing that can be done, the profitability of the Aero operating company. And then, our partner besides General Growth, Authentic Brands Group, continues to do an excellent job. And the brand development of both Aero and then ultimately all their brands, as well as Nautica, which we expect to close here in the next 30 days. So, it\u2019s okay. We have a decent story to tell in our retail investments so far. So, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Yulico of UBS. Your line is now open. Nick Yulico : Good morning, everyone. Looking at the increase in tenant sale per square foot trying to figure out how much is attributed to turning out in weaker tenants from the portfolio versus sales growth. And so, could we get some perspective on what is the average sales per square foot for tenants that have thrown out of the portfolio through bankruptcy in the quarter and in the last year? David Simon : We don\u2019t have those numbers there. But we have such huge portfolio we lost 1 million square feet in bankruptcies. Our small shops are 65 million. So, no matter how you want to do that Nick, it\u2019s not going to be material. Okay? You can make up a number and do it yourself and you will see that\u2019s not material. 65 million square feet is still 65 million square feet. Nick Yulico : And then, on the development page, recognizing these numbers can fluctuate. But, the expected return is now 8%, it was 9% last quarter. What\u2019s driving that? Is it tougher construction costs or some change in product mix, location? David Simon : Things come in, things go out; we round it. So, there is some rounding up and rounding down, but nothing out of the ordinary mix change. That\u2019s it. Operator : Thank you our next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vincent Chao : I just want to go back to the Aeropostale conversation little bit. Obviously, you\u2019ve done a good job stabilizing it on a big basis. But I am just curious there were some special circumstances when you bought that. I guess, what\u2019s the longer term plan there? It seems like not something you would necessarily keep long-term but just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the long-term for that investment? David Simon : Well, again, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a small investment. We have basically less than $30 million in it. So, obviously, it\u2019s a very good investment. It does -- we bought it really, really fortunately. The team has done very good job. But again, our investment in this is basically $30 million. So, it\u2019s not like I obsess with. I do obsess with making sure the operations continue to move forward in the positive manner, which they have been. But, it\u2019s not -- for $30 million, I am not going to -- it\u2019s not like oh God, we got to do something with Aero. But I am open to any of your idea that you\u2019d like. Vincent Chao : Leverage buyout, okay? David Simon : That\u2019s the one thing we\u2019ll not do. Okay. Vincent Chao : I guess, just another question maybe something you are obsessed a little bit more, just the big progress that you mentioned that are going to come into the pipeline. You saw the share of your net cost there -- the reporting numbers go up for the first time in a little while. I guess, after these are all in there, I guess, or maybe by the end of the year, what do you think the pipeline will be? Is it going to be over 1.5 billion at that point, just given some of the things that have been brought on? And then from a delivery perspective, is that more of a 2020 kind of NOI uplift? David Simon : Well, what I would say to you is the stuff that we\u2019re working on now, again, part of the timing is -- the great thing about us is we\u2019re not long development. So, we can turn it on and turn it off, just like our balance sheet. But, I would say to you the stuff that\u2019s in the pipeline now is over $4 billion. And I would call that more than a shadow pipeline, I\u2019d call the real pipeline. The difficulty in answering your question, which is not that it\u2019s not an appropriate question, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s hard to tell you exactly when that will come on line. But, I would say to you, as Tom has described, it\u2019s going to be about a 1 billion plus a year. I still feel like that\u2019s the right number, because we\u2019ve got this $4 billion pipe that I see and I can identify clearly whether it\u2019s 2 billion one year, 1 billion another year, kind of it\u2019s -- that\u2019s harder to -- because a lot of these are little bit out of our control and that you just have to go through the approval process. But the real stuff is $4 billion. And all that\u2019s like in works now. And so that\u2019s why I still think that 1 billion plus a year is probably a pretty good number because it\u2019ll take three, four years to get all basically done. And then, we\u2019ll add to that as well because obviously even though we have 12 Sears stores, that\u2019s not -- there is going to be more. That\u2019s not the end. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Mueller of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : I appreciate the color on the development pipeline. I guess, the one question I have left is this first quarter lease term, how much of that was contemplated in guidance? And is there anything else material that you expect in the balance of the year. David Simon : Yes. It was all pretty much in our initial guidance because it was unique situation that was -- that we had anticipated that was going to be resolved. Michael Mueller : And for the balance of the year, anything else material in there? David Simon : On lease term, not really. And again, I just -- it\u2019s always been part of our business, it\u2019s an okay part of our business. Because if you can get the present value of lease obligation and then you get the space back, it\u2019s not too shabby as my hero would say. But, I don\u2019t sense that there\u2019s anything really that\u2019s going to be that extraordinary. And again, remember, Michael, it\u2019s not in our comp NOI. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum : Question on -- David, you\u2019ve built a reputation as being a pretty astute capital allocator. And as you look at the various platforms that you\u2019re allocating capital to, whether you\u2019re your U.S. mall business, your outlet business or your international business or for that matter, buying back your own stock, can you maybe talk about the attractiveness, as you sit right now, for each of those uses of capital? Clearly you continue to invest and plow money back into your U.S. mall portfolio, but maybe if you can talk about relative attractiveness, particularly regarding your stock as well. David Simon : Well, I mean, right now, it\u2019s basically 12 times. It\u2019s highly attractive. And the only hypothetical constrain in that is that we just think having -- it\u2019s never really manifested itself in our multiples. The optionality of having this powerful balance sheet is something that I never want to get rid of. So, we could buy a ton of stock back but we always are going to be conservative on that front only because we want this powerful balance sheet for optionality reasons, optionality to do something external, optionality to weather any storm, make additional investments, make our properties better and never. And so, we\u2019re never going -- remember, Rick and I workout dudes. Okay? Rick, I mean, when I got back to the real estate business in 1990, I spent from \u201890, to \u201893 doing workouts; Rick did it as well, right, Rick? Rick Sokolov : Yes. David Simon : So, Andy is here, he is conservative. So, that\u2019s -- we\u2019ll never jeopardize the balance sheet. Now, I don\u2019t think we get rewarded for it as much as we probably should. But that\u2019s fine. It is what it is. I don\u2019t think the rating agencies appreciated it as much as they should. But that\u2019s fine. It is what it is. And so for us -- I just think, we\u2019re never going to be wildly aggressive on buying our stock back just because we want that ultimate flexibility. But the priorities are we\u2019ll continue to buy stock back, the biggest priority we have obviously is we\u2019re really excited about all this mixed use stuff that we\u2019re doing and some of these big projects. That\u2019s going to be the future of a lot of investment and growth. And then, we may take the Company in the different direction. Michael Bilerman mentioned the consumer. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t rule out some interesting things from us down the road, because I think -- I just think we have the ability to do stuff like that that we should rule out. So, I hope that answers your question. And thankfully, we have a $1.5 billion cash flow after dividend that we can put back into the business. And we\u2019re not over our skis. So, if we end up in a really tough recessionary environment, we\u2019re not going to -- and I wrote this in my letter. We are not -- again, we are not going to -- the development community historically leverage-leverage, increase rates of return, blah, blah, blah. We are never going to push that to the limit even though it makes your return on investment that much better and all the other metrics associated with it. It\u2019s just not who we are. So, I mean, I -- it\u2019s a long winded answer. But, I mean -- so, we\u2019ll continue to kind of -- what we\u2019re doing I think right now is what we\u2019ll continue to do. But, I want the option that if obviously if it gets different, I am going to step one thing up or decrease one thing up. That allows us. We have the optionality to do that. Floris van Dijkum : One other question, David, I\u2019d love to get your color on what you think the Unibail entry into the U.S. by Westfield means for the global retail dynamics and also for the U.S. mall dynamics? David Simon : Well, first of all I would say, one or two points. One is, people that are looking for a mark on values, it\u2019s a very, very healthy mark; and two is operationally, I don\u2019t see -- we\u2019ll wait to see. I mean, I\u2019ll reserve judgment there but I don\u2019t see a big significant change. I mean Westfield did a good job before. I am sure they\u2019ll do a good job after. But, I think the most important thing is that there is a very healthy mark-out there if you are interested in those marks. I think from our standpoint, we will little to no impact. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai : Do you have any comments on 1Q traffic across the different property types? What kind of uptick are you seeing, given improve trends coming out of the better holiday season? David Simon : I\u2019d say, generally, it was -- I mean, wasn\u2019t like up 5%, it was up around 1 across the board and it didn\u2019t really matter if there were outlets or malls; it was kind of across the board. The outlets tend to get a little bit more to hit because of the weather. But, even though -- even they were up. Linda Tsai : Are you seeing tourism come back to the outlet? David Simon : Yes, we are, even though it\u2019s not as robust as it has been. It continues to move. Outlet sales were really, really nice in the first quarter. So, a lot more retailers are doing better. So, we were very pleased generally with the outlet results. Linda Tsai : Great. And then, can you offer some insights on Kl\u00e9pierre walking away from its bid of Hammerson. What might have been the thinking behind that? David Simon : Well, it\u2019s really -- even though lots of discussion on this. Kl\u00e9pierre, there\u2019s a supervisor board and executive board. We\u2019re on the supervisory board but the executive Board really runs the company and makes those decisions. So, it\u2019s really more important to hear from them. That was a Kl\u00e9pierre led efforts in transaction. Obviously, they didn\u2019t do it without the supervisory board giving them the green light to do yes or no. But it\u2019s really that\u2019s question is really much better directed toward them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Bilerman : Hey. David, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman with two quick follow-ups. Is there anything with all the things going on with all of your competitors, whether it is the Westfield-Unibail merger, the GGP-Brookfield deal, clearly you\u2019ve had management changes that may assert in financial activism, the activism [indiscernible]. Does this allow Simon at all to take advantage of all those things going on for shareholders at all, in terms of just operations and dealing with things and there is just more on uncertainty at all your competitors, not from an M&A perspective. David Simon : I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think they are all running their business I think very effectively. So, I don\u2019t see that at all. They all have the good -- the ones you mentioned all have good properties, good management teams. I would imagine all of that\u2019s business as usual, regardless of whatever corporate activities going on. So, I don\u2019t think so. Michael Bilerman : You\u2019re not hearing that from me retailers that just may like loves drama going on in C suite or corporate at all? David Simon : Not at all. Michael Bilerman : And then just going back to this whole thing there, returns and the leases and you\u2019re comment about the CAM audits and the movement towards fixed CAM and how that changed. Is there any change in the way you\u2019re doing new lease agreements to address this for you to make sure that you\u2019re getting your fair share, percentage rents and the right rent at the end of the day for a space? David Simon : Well, I mean that\u2019s a really good question and it\u2019s a big question. And every retailer is different. It\u2019s just - -I mean, believe it or not Rick, me, John Rulli and his team, I mean we\u2019re -- every retail is different. We\u2019re very focused on it. There\u2019s not a standard response yet, but it\u2019s -- it needs to be addressed in the future leases. Because we all -- we don\u2019t mind internet sales. I mean, because we do think there\u2019s a lot of returns associated with it. We obviously want those returns in the store because that facilitates a trip and it helps the retailer. And it\u2019s all just a function of making sure it\u2019s appropriately dealt with. So, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not an adversarial scenario but it just needs to be appropriately addressed. And we\u2019re in the midst of trying to figure out what\u2019s the right approach. And unfortunately, there\u2019s not a cookie-cutter answer because every retailer does a little bit different. But it\u2019s not -- we want the returns in the store. We want the trip in the store. But it -- as you know, I have been like, don\u2019t worry too much about sales and I\u2019ve been too prudent [ph] on that. And I understand why the market doesn\u2019t like my view of that. But the reality, it\u2019s becoming even -- there\u2019s even a bigger gap on the focus on this because there\u2019s more -- certainly more business being done online but that also means more returns. And the consumer likes to do the returns in the store. And the reality is this whole green effort, we wrote a white paper three-four years ago about the fact that we all want higher levels of sustainability from an energy point of view. And the reality is the internet and the constant packaging and the constant state of returns is really a lot less green than doing your trip in total. So, there\u2019s a lot of stuff on this but I don\u2019t want to bore you. But point is, I don\u2019t have a good answer for you yet other than we\u2019re working cooperatively with our clients to find out what the right answer is. And it\u2019s not a fair share thing, it\u2019s just -- as long as we have to report that number, I want -- we need to somehow -- the market needs to understand there\u2019s this issue that\u2019s out there. Michael Bilerman : And I wanted to congratulate Andy on his retirement, next to go out with a $30 billion balance sheet at under 3.5% rate with a seven-year average maturity, certainly calling it probably the peak from that perspective. But, is there any comments in terms of CFO process? What you\u2019re go through internal versus external and how you think that\u2019s going to be, timing wise? David Simon : So, first of all, Andy, we\u2019ll say goodbye to Andy, not till the end of this year. But, Andy has done a fantastic job as we all know. And when I wrote the comments about his retirement, I really, really meant them and not that I don\u2019t mean what I write. But the fact of the matter is that I felt a -- in my heart how I felt about Andy. He\u2019s done a tremendous job. He has done such a good job that there is no financing that we need to do. Okay? So, that\u2019s kind of ironic, right? So this is a CFO that\u2019s done such a great job, the reality is there\u2019s nothing to do. I\u2019m kidding. There is always something to do. But currently, the simple answer is, we -- looking more internally. We have some really good internal candidates. And I\u2019m thinking more of that as opposed to external. But, I haven\u2019t put a pin in it yet. But Andy\u2019s done a unbelievable job with the balance sheet. He and I have worked together 25 years. He\u2019s got the best relationships in the industry, banking industry. And we will certainly miss him but the reality is he\u2019s done such a good job, there is nothing to do. David Simon : 16 billion in the last three years, plus to revolvers that you got a great internal group that can step up into your commence, we always set a great infrastructure here with very, very strong candidate and the team environment in the finance department. Andy Juster : $16 billion in the last three years, plus two revolvers. But, you\u2019ve got a great internal group that can step up in an year\u2019s time. We\u2019ve always had a great infrastructure here with very, very candidates. And it\u2019s a team environment in the finance department. David Simon : So, the answer is I\u2019m thinking about it. I\u2019m getting closer and closer. But Andy is right, it\u2019s a team effort. But, it\u2019ll develop this year. Christy McElroy : David, it\u2019s Christy, just one more quick one for me. You suggested buybacks are likely to continue. To what extent are assumptions for additional buybacks from here contemplated in the current FFO guidance range? David Simon : They really aren\u2019t other than what we\u2019ve already done. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.David Simon for any further remarks. David Simon : All right. Thank you everyone. I appreciate your questions and your comments. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participating in today\u2019s conference. This does concludes today\u2019s program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

David Simon : Good morning. We\u2019re pleased to report another record quarter with operating and financial results. Demand from tenants from space in our highly productive centers is increasing. We continue to redevelop our irreplaceable real estate with new exciting dynamic ways to live work, plays, stay and shop that will further enhance the customer experience. We continued identifying new unique and strategic development opportunities globally that will extend our geographic reach and create a new generation of world-class destinations on a accretive basis. And let me turn to results, which were highlighted by funds from operation FFO of $1.0 6 billion or $2.98 per share, an increase of 20.6% compared to the prior year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio NOI increased four 4.5% or approximately $135 million year-to-date. Comp NOI increased 2.3% for the year-to-date period. Leasing activity remains solid and continues to improve. Average base rent was $53.84, up 3.3% compared to last year. The mall and Premium Outlets recorded leasing spreads of $7.32 per square foot, and an increase of 10.7%. We're pleased to announce that retail sales momentum continue to pick up in the second quarter. Reported retailer sales per square foot for malls and outlets was $646 per foot compared to $618 million in the prior year period, an increase of 4.6%, which is a large increase - largest actually over the last four years. Retail sales were strong across the portfolio with sales productivity increasing each month throughout the quarter. Our mall - Premium Outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 94.7%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the quarter this year. Importantly on an NOI awaited basis our operating metrics were as follows. Reported retail sales on an NOI awaited basis is 813 compared to 646. Occupancy is 95.6% compared to 94.7%. Average base minimum rent is $70.70 cents - $70.77 compared to $53.84. Turning to a new development, we opened the Premium Outlet collection in Edmonton, Canada making our fourth outlet center in Canada. It's a terrific opening. It's the only outlet center in Edmonton and so far locals and tourists have really appreciated the new project. Construction continues on several additional new outlets. Denver, Colorado which will open in September, Queretaro, Mexico, which will open in December, Malaga, Spain will open in the spring of \u201919. During the quarter, we also announced a new joint venture with Siam Piwat, a world class retail and real estate developer to bring our internationally renowned Premium Outlet experience to Thailand. This will be our first outlet in Thailand adding to our already successful joint ventures in Japan, Korea and Malaysia. Our centre in Bangkok is projected to begin construction later this year and will be a destination of choice for the 50 million metro area locals and obviously the country's very strong tourism with over 32 million visitors per year. At the end of the second quarter redevelopment expansions were all ongoing across all of our platforms in the U.S., internationally just to name a few, we're expanding in Vancouver, in Canada, Ashford, in the - outside of London, as well as our big transformations with Brea, Ross Park, King of Prussia, many more in the works. Capital markets, obviously our balance sheet continues to be industry leading. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times well below our peer group. Fixed interest coverage was 5 times. We only have 5% of our debt is variable rate. We refinanced approximately $2.4 billion of mortgage debt. Our share of that being 850 and an average rate of 3.98% and term of 8.9 years. Our current liquidity is $7 billion and we repurchased 514,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $80 million. We also announced our dividend this quarter of $2 per share, an increase over of 11.1% year-over-year. We will pay at least $7.90 per share and dividends, an increase of more than 10% compared to the $7.15 [ph] paid last year and sometime \u2013 and sometime next year we will have paid $100 per share in dividends, $100 per share of dividends throughout our public history. Finally, we're just pleased with the Supreme Court's decision. As you know, we were been very vocal about it and we do think this will help level the playing field between physical retailers and online and hopefully the communities that those physical retailers and those properties serve. Guidance, we raised our full year guidance from $12.05 to $12.13 per share. This is an increase of $0.09 from our original prior guidance and represents 7.5% to 8.2% growth compared to our FFO of 11.21 per share for 2017. Finally, I would just like to say it was a very good quarter and we continue to grow our cash flow with our good earnings momentum. We're ready for questions now. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Good morning, good morning out there. David Simon : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb : Yeah. So my first question is, I don't think you talked about the big jump in other income, but in aggregate, if you could just talk about what the drivers were in there. And then also what your thoughts are on the impact of the change in internal leasing costs to 2019? Some of the other companies are starting to provide some estimate, so that the analyst can through up their numbers for 2019? David Simon : Yes. The jump in other income was basically a gain in converting our Aero, IPCO investment into shares, out Authentic Brands Group and that number was offset by a significant decrease in lease settlement income. When you net the two it's essentially a positive $25 million, roughly. The good news on that Alex is, I know there were a lot of naysayers on the Aero deal, were way in the money. We've already converted into a significant profit and Authentic Brands Group is a great company. We're a shareholder of around 6% roughly and we continue to think that company will do great things and it's great to be a partner associated with Jamie Salter and his team, as well as Lion Capital, General Atlantic and Leonard Green. Obviously, you know, a very high level, as well as General Growth frankly, a very high level group of shareholders that will continue to accumulate brands and present opportunities for us. And then obviously we had a pretty significant decrease in lease settlement income. If you go quarter-over-quarter. And on the leasing you know, we're still finalizing it, but it'll be under 1%, under 1% of our you know, of our run $12 plus. So I hope - I know you're smart and I hope you can do that math. Alexander Goldfarb : I have back up just in case. The next question is you know, lot of headlines recently over Tesla them asking for cash back from their suppliers. Clearly it's been a big driver of mall traffic. So can you just talk a little bit about your thoughts on Tesla? And then also just what we heard last week from some of the other retail companies, it sounds like the pace of backfilling space had increased. So maybe if you could just combine those, how you're thinking about the pace of backfilling tenants? David Simon : Yeah. Just - Tesla is a great company, a great product, no concerns. I'll let Rick talk about retailer demand. And you know, I would say we feel pretty good. But let Rick add to that. Rick Sokolov : In fact, it is accelerating and there is increasing interest you saw in our filings. We've done a lot of new leasing. Again, I won't incur David's wrath by listing all the tenants that we're doing business with. But there are a lot of them. We came out of our meetings with a significant number of open device across a broad swap of tenants. And as I said before, they are coming from e-tailers, international, existing tenants and brand extensions from our existing tenants, along with new tenants. And that is feeding our pipeline and I think you're seeing that as you walk our property. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Michael Berman : Hey. It's Michael Berman here with Christine. Happy Monday. David you included a new slide in the supplemental slide 28 on the development activity summary, where you sort of broke down the share of net cost of the [indiscernible] in the quarter pipeline between the platform, and then redev and dev. I'm wondering how you think about that densification piece of 15% today. But really each of the slices how you think that's going to evolve over the next few years, given you have a lot of projects in the pipeline that are not yet sort of in the activity summary, how you think that\u2019s - this is going to evolve both in terms of total size, in terms of cost, how that [indiscernible] in a quarter move and then the share between each of the slices? David Simon : Yeah. I mean, I can only - I can only answer you know in big picture terms, because as you know, we only put this - we don't our development type like you know like the European companies do. But\u2026 Michael Berman : Shadow of the shadow of the shadow\u2026 David Simon : Yeah. If we did - if we did though, the general number would be over $5 billion of readily available projects. And I would say to you Michael the shift will be more towards the mall - the U.S. mall and densification effort. And so you know right now if you put those two together it's roughly 50%. I would think that that would tend to you know when we put on that King of Prussia and the Brea as we turn that in, but in that development pipe that reaches $5 billion. You'd see more of a shift there. As an example, we don't have Phipps Plaza in yet, even though we know it's goal project, we're finalizing all of our numbers. We'll take that to our development community here in the next, I think in the next month or so. So I think you'll see that shift in that take a bigger chunk of that. You know, international is episodic. We've got - we're - you know obviously we're excited about what's going on in Thailand and we're looking in other areas in Southeast Asia. We're also looking in the Middle East with our you know Premium Outlet business. So - and I do think we'll find - continue to find a U.S. Premium Outlet new development and I think you'll see the redevelopment of that portfolio begin to pick up. Given the big nature of these projects, so the densification of mall you know, I see that - I would see that tend to increase generically. Michael Berman : And then when you guys did the Aero deal, I remember you talked on the conference call about vertical integration and that was the time of - I think the Time Warner deal had been announced at that point and then you made a big deal about how vertical\u2026 David Simon : I didn't make a big deal. Okay, let's be clear, let's be clear on that. Michael Berman : What I was saying was, you made a big deal about how you know other companies are given a lot of rope for vertical integration and much larger things versus $25 million, $30 million investment on a $100 billion company that wanted some latitude to do those sorts of things and couple of years later that investment as you mentioned clearly is done well and you've been able to rotate your stake in real larger brand oriented company. So going forward, how do you think about furthering those sorts of investments where you are taking some level of additional vertical integration in terms of types of experiential type real estate or other types of brands or other retailers or other things that you would be able to see to bring to your assets? Does that change the calculus at all in your head? David Simon : Well, you know, we feel comfortable that we - you know we're not \u2013 you know maybe we can replicate what we did in Aero. But I mean my goodness, we are - we had essentially no investment in Aero and the business is - I mean we actually have a real big gain, obviously because we see the GAAP financial statements. But you know, that's a business that we you know have effectively from a book value no gain or no investment, negative investment that is you've gotten the gains through the P&L and we still own you know just under 6% ABG, which is worth more than you know a lot more investment. We have the operating business which will throw off. You know, I don't know. We own a little under 50% which will throw off in the $30 million to $35 million range EBITDA, pretax, blah, blah, blah. So and as you know we got criticized on that deal and a lot of the people were concerned we  bought it because that's the only way we could keep the rent payer, and all these other stuff. So hopefully we've put some of that aside. We just thought there was - you know this was a brand that was doing at $1.2 billion of sales. And it had the - it made sense to be able to save the brand. So I feel comfortable we're going to continue to find those investments. We're going to - we're looking at a number of them in the retail restaurant area. we're also looking at a number of them in the venture capital area. And then I wouldn't rule out you know those won't be big investments Michael, but then I wouldn't rule out you know at some point a bigger investment that you know that really aligns with what we're doing, which is we collect \u2013 we\u2019re in a brand building business, the consumer facing business. And obviously we've got all these physical property. So I wouldn't rule it out, but you know nothing's in the works right now. But we'll continue to make hopefully smart tactical investments in good businesses, in good brands and good retailers and good restaurants. And we're working on a number of them. But those won't be sizable, in terms of what you've seen historically. And I will add you know that given Aero\u2019s success, I mean ABG and Aero brought the Nautica business just recently. And you know creating a similar OpCo IPCo structure you know, and we think that's another good brand to be part of that family. Michael Berman : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore. You8r line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. David Simon : Good morning Steve Sakwa : Hey, David, just looking at your page 27, the development activity, I mean I realize that some of the numbers kind of bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Your overall development returns were pretty flat and unchanged from last quarter. The mall redevelopment did tick down a couple hundred basis points. And I'm just wondering if there's anything specific that relates to mix or maybe there's more residential coming in that has lower returns. Anything we should kind of know about that? David Simon : Not really. You know, I would say generally in all of our - all of these kind of metrics, whether they're you know sales, lease spreads, occupancy, development returns. You know we are always going to have quarter-to-quarter ups, downs, flatness, et cetera. So generally it's just new stuff coming out. Its open coming out, new stuff coming in and I wouldn't say you know Steve there's any trend there other than mix changes all the time. Steve Sakwa : And maybe just a follow up. Just anything on the construction cost side, just given all the things that we're hearing about, whether it's steel, aluminium, other import prices. I mean, how do you sort of think about that if you're looking at new projects and underwriting them? David Simon : Well, that's a very good question. I do - we are planning for cost increases. So you know, we're going to - obviously we're covered in the stuff that's under construction, because we generally do a guaranteed max price contract. But the new stuff's all going to be vetted with what we think is higher construction cost. And again those returns are going to have to be generated that will be accretive to us, otherwise we won't do it. But I do think that that's a fair statement. Costs are rising. And you know, I wouldn't call it material yet or deal breaking by any stretch of the imagination. But we are - we are confronted with our construction cost. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then maybe just going back to some of the e-tailer comments that you made, I know - I believe it was Roosevelt Field. You sort of created almost like an incubator or space concept for the e-tailers and would rotate folks through. I'm just curious how that sort of experiments gone and sort of what your thought is about rolling that out across the portfolio? David Simon : Good question. I think you know, we are still experimenting with the edit. It is doing well. We're cycling retailers in and out, not necessarily e-tailors. It could be someone wanting to build their brand, take advantage of the traffic in the mall, et cetera. We do \u2013 you know, I'd say it's a little early yet to commit to this, but we do think that that's a business that you know once we fine-tune it, we could roll it out a little bit more. I know number of our peers are also experimenting with similar concepts. So I do think there's a business there. We've been pleased with it. You know it's - we have growing pains like anything else. We cycled brands in and out of it, but I think we feel - we feel there's an opportunity there, hard to quantify and hard to tell you how many. But there's clearly - I mean, there's no difference here than anything. I mean, people \u2013 I shouldn't say people, brands and retailers want access to our traffic that's going through our buildings. It's up to us as the owners of it to make it in a way that presents their business so that the consumer can experience it. And I think this is one of many ways that we can do it. Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything. Rick Sokolov : The only thing I would also say is we've already had one of the tenants in there that is opening up some incremental locations with us throughout the portfolio because they were pleased with the experience they had there. So it does work as an incubator and we're seeing positive results out of it. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And maybe just last question, Dave you touched on sales up a little over 4.5%. I don't know if you or Rick just kind of maybe provide any commentary around categories or just things that did really well in the second quarter, maybe some of the areas that are lagging? David Simon : The stronger categories were home improvement, sporting goods, entertainment, home entertainment, family apparel. Weaker were women's, moderate in special sizes and home furniture. Steve Sakwa : Okay, Guys. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Schmidt : Great, thanks. Maybe you could get an update on Simon's new tech initiatives to better connect its consumers with its centers? David Simon : Well, that's a long winded answer on an earnings call. I\u2019d just say Greg, there is a lots going on in how we're approaching that. We have a number of ideas how to do it better. So we're doing both incremental approach, you know, to increase that connection. But I also think there are broader and bigger ideas that we have that we\u2019re considering. So you know, I would say if you look at some of the generic things that are out there, you know, our visits store, our app store and our website are significant, our gift card sales are significant increases year-over-year, so we're making our connection through all - the various social medias are increasing and growing. So there's a lot going on that we're doing. Our showcase of deals is getting more throughput, more retailers are joining. So there's so much going on incrementally that\u2019s showing very positive signs. But you know, we're also in the phase of developing bigger and better ideas to scale with even \u2013 even at a greater extent. Rick Sokolov : The one thing I would add is we also have that. We\u2019ve moved online our coupon book and our VIP Club at Premium Outlets and that's generating literally millions of members that are substantially enhancing our ability to track our customers and establish relationships with them. So that's been also very positive in that area. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And would you say your marketing budgets at your new individual centers are moving away from traditional media and towards some of these newer emerging ways to connect? David Simon : Without question, yeah, a big shift in - you know, now listen we all - we shouldn't say all, I struggle all the time on return on investment and marketing dollars, some others might. But clearly the shift is toward social media away from traditional print and television. We still believe television can provide a lot of reach. But you know, I think we're no different than a lot of other major companies that are - that are moving toward more social media to the extent that those platforms deliver what they say they're going to deliver. And you know, obviously we won't get into that that whole issue. Craig Schmidt : And just lastly, are you seeing the strength in your \u2013 on your properties, on luxury retailers, we seem to be hearing from other sources? David Simon : Yes. We had very good results with our luxury category without question. Craig Schmidt : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Rich Hill : Hey, David. Good morning. I wanted just follow up on the expense side, you've noted previously that you've done a good job of tightening the so-called belt on expenses and it looks like you did another good job with that this quarter. So wondering you know, how much further you think you might have in terms of reducing those expenses just as we look forward over the next couple of quarters and maybe the next year. I am not looking for you to give guidance, but just in terms of your ability to continue to tighten up there? That would be helpful. David Simon : I would say to you we're in pretty good shape. I don't expect anything dramatic now. The one thing I would point out to you and Tom I don't know what page it is, our other expenses went down. This was not included in our funds from operation. But part of our other expense, what page is that Tom? Tom Ward : Page 21. David Simon : Page 21 went down because of the increase in the stock price of WPG quarter-over-quarter. We elected not to put that in funds from operation, otherwise we would have generated $0.03 more and you can see that, that's basically a reduction of other expense, that's in footnote 3 there. So you may - I don't know if you saw that or not Rich, but I just want to point that out. But I would say the broader question is, we're - you know we're probably in pretty good shape on the expenses. We're always focused on it, but I wouldn't expect anything dramatic there. Rich Hill : Got it. And just maybe one other question if I can. Going back to the other income, I understand the reclassification from Aero, I'm sorry for maybe being dense here. But I was a little bit confused by the offset by lease settlement income. Can you clarify that. I assume you mean that lease settlement income maybe wasn't as high this quarter versus last quarter given Teavana? David Simon : Yeah. I mean, basically I don't remember went to Teavana was in. But last Q over Q, I think we had a reduction of roughly $10 million plus in lease settlement income and the net increase in other income is around 25. I wouldn't call it a reclass, it's actually not a reclass. We exchanged our interest in the Aero IPCo, which we own around 30% or shares in Authentic Brands Group on a value based upon where they recently - new investors came into to the company. We thought that was a good transaction for us because it not only diversifies the risk, but we\u2019re then writing you know the growth of the ABG above and beyond what happens with Aero. So wasn't a reclass, it was actually a transaction. But basically those are the two differences I hope I answered your question. Rich Hill : You did. Thank you very much. David Simon : Sure. Rich Hill : That's it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys. Good morning. Just given some of the shifts we're seeing in the retail landscape today, e-commerce continuing to grow. I was hoping you could talk about the importance of scale today. We saw when your mall peers combine earlier this year, you guys obviously moved away from a portion of your lower gross assets a few years ago with the WPG spend. But obviously you\u2019ve continued to build - in your opening remarks you mentioned expanding geographically, expanding your reach. So just wondering if you could talk about the advantages of getting bigger in today's environment? David Simon : Well, listen I think you know more or less as we've seen in corporate America, I think scale is really important. You know, and it goes beyond - beyond real estate. You know, look at look at BlackRock, I mean, where do they run $6 trillion, you know that scale is important. Look at that Blackstone, in terms of their private equity and real estate business. Look at obviously - you know look at what's going on with the tech companies you know, from you know all the things that they all have scale and believe me they use that to their advantage in a lot of ways. So I think scale is important. You know, the offset on scale is that our business in you know when you get to the fundamentals of the real estate it's still a very local business. So you've got to be able to do both in our business, whereas you know some of these other companies don't have to worry necessarily about you the location main and main, where we do. So that scale is important learned experiences you know are important. And I think we've been able to do a lot of what we've been able to do because you know we've grown our business. On the other hand, you know, you can blow it, it all takes is one you know big scale deal. And if you don't - if you don't understand it appropriately or you stretch the balance sheet you know too much and you can't weather a down cycle, I mean, you can - it can go for naught. So you try to find that fine balance, it's very difficult in a lot a respects. And I would just finally say that you know we feel the good thing about what we feel about is that we you know, we don't feel and I've been said this for a little bit of time, but we don't feel like we have to just do a deal just to do a deal, we'll find where we can add value and make some money on it. Jeremy Metz : I appreciate that color. And then just one last one for me, just in terms of densifying assets or adding these other non-retailer users, you\u2019ve talked about enhancing the experience in terms of the live work play and shop and you guys have obviously increased your focus on adding these other uses, I mean it's partially resulted to simply getting more access, do you think, or boxes, your peers have done the same. I'm just wondering, just part of your larger development, redevelopement group or do you have a dedicated team looking specifically at these opportunities and if you do, do you continue to hire of that as add more projects, or do you feel like the team is largely built out at this point to handle what seems like a growing pipeline of opportunities? David Simon : Yeah, no. All right on spot. So here's the way we do it generally, we have a development group that will get the permit. So you know, what I call the traditional mall development group, but the actual underwriting development, construction, et cetera is actually housed within its own separate group. And we are adding resources to that group to do our hotel and our multifamily opportunities that you know in some cases we'll do at our own as you know, some case we do with JVs. So our roles and responsibilities change on by deal, but we're - you know the permitting process is basically that same process that we've embarked upon for year after year after year. But we are adding resources to the execution and the identification and importantly the underwriting of that group and I think we'll continue to add dedicated - we actually just hired someone that will do you know - continue to do hotel and resi stuff. So you know without question we\u2019ll be beefing up some internal resources. Jeremy Metz : Thanks for the time, David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. David Simon :  Good morning. Haendel St. Juste: So David my Mizuho counterpart in Asia recently hosted some property tours on the ground there and noted incredible growth. So I guess I'm curious why you aren\u2019t there in a bigger presence, is your new outlet in Thailand perhaps a sign of more to come or you looking at looking at more in Asia these days and could we perhaps see Simon making incremental shift to do more in Asia given the opportunity relative to the US? David Simon : Well, you know it's not - we've basically decided we don't want to do full price in Asia. You know, absent some unbelievable dislocation in the market and you know almost clay peer-like in you know full prices, you know troubled and you know the world's ending and you know, you go in and you buy it at a discount to the value. So what we've found is that our Premium Outlet brand has terrific identity there and the ability to do that is basically new development, right. So new development takes time and part of that is finding the - you know we don't want to do that ourselves, so we have to find the right partner and then we have to find the right sites and then we have to develop it and then we have to lease it. It just takes time. So I'm pleased to note that our partnership in Japan is doing well, same thing in Korea, same thing in Malaysia and now in Thailand we have a great partner and I think we're starting off here, it's going to take a couple of years to build. We have a great partner in Mexico and great partners in Canada. So definitely we\u2019ll grow that business. But that's why it takes the time it takes and yes we are looking at other markets in Southeast Asia, but it does - it just \u2013 its a longer - unless you're going to go buy something - development takes time. Haendel St. Juste: What about China, specifically? David Simon : It's a very you know interesting question and that we think about the outlet business in China all the time. We've looked at opportunities all the time. We have not found the right one. But we have certainly by no stretch of the imagination ruled out the outlet business in China. I mean, that could be a possibility for the company under the right - under the right circumstances. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you for that. Curious on of your thoughts on stock buybacks here, it looks like you're buying back during the quarter with the stock down in the 150, stocks moved a bit here, curious on what your appetite at these levels would be? David Simon : I think it's still to be opportunistic. You know, we'll continue to buy stock back, you know, we try to be thoughtful when we do it and take advantage of the market when it's volatile. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Last one, on lease up progress at your recent redev and development projects, Denver, Boca, I'm curious, are you getting the merchandise, the rates and the lease term you're seeking. And as part of that how does the average length of terms for your new deals, not renewals, but new deals compared to say 5 or 10 years ago? Thank you. Rick Sokolov : In terms of Denver and in the expansion in Toronto, you're going to find those opening substantially leased over 90% with great collections of tenants, including luxury and really across the board. So we've been very pleased with how that has been done. In our new deals the terms are very consistent with what they have been historically. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai of Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai : Hi. Retail REITs I know lease settlement income is not in SS NOI. But we can also assume that the Aero gain was also excluded from SS NOI, right? David Simon : Yes. Let's -- it's not incomparable. It's in our FFO. And I couldn't hear exactly what you said. So restate it. Linda Tsai : I just want to know is Aero in your SS NOI? David Simon : Oh no, I'm sorry. I thought I was hearing FF. No it's not in our same store NOI, absolutely not. Linda Tsai : Okay. David Simon : As you know - as you pointed out, nor is lease settlement income. Linda Tsai : Okay. And then when you think about how retailers are building brands these days, you know, what's critical or what are some of the trends, like I've read for example that you know, stores feel like they need to be Instagrammable, and millennials like and prefer subscription services? But what do you think is changed from a real estate point of view for landlords. And you know what are you doing to facilitate these new requirements? David Simon : Well, I think you know, they basically want great \u2013 nothing\u2019s changed in that sense. I mean, they want really good real estate with traffic and the right brands around them. So you know, it's interesting and I won't - I don't want to steal Rick's thunder in this. But you know, I would say we have at least 50, 60 retailers. We actually break them by category in these categories. You know, their e-commerce, pure e-commerce growing and then they want stores or they want access to our consumers. We have the growth e-commerce, in other words they've already done that and they are growing. We have the international expanders, people that are from international that are expanding. Then we have the new international tenants and they are starting to grow. We have start up or to renew the portfolio with national aspirations and growth categories which are a start up or new to portfolio, again with national aspirations. When you put them together in these categories in have 50 names, but what they all want is consumers you know, the right cotenancy so to speak, if I can't come up with a better word and they want to be in. And I also want \u2013 I think the - who the owner of their real estate is important to them to some degree. I mean, so when you put it all together, and you know that's - I think that's what they want. I hope I answered your question. Linda Tsai : Thanks. That was helpful. Just one last question on \u2013 a clarification on Washington Prime. Why has their fair value changed? Because I didn't out guys still held shares? David Simon : We had units that we had since the spinoff under 3%. We've had that from the get go. And the only reason why that volatility is in and out is because of the new accounting standards. So that started at the beginning of this year. And so each quarter we have the mark-to-market in any public securities or readily marketable securities that we have. We have chosen not to include that in FFO and again, as we said you can see that on page 21, you can see the financial impacts, it does it does go through our GAAP statements. Linda Tsai : And what we the fair market value adjustments, the result of? David Simon : Its because the stock went up. Linda Tsai : Okay. David Simon : It's better than it going down. Actually the quarter before it went down. So we had a loss - we had an increase in our other expense Q1. And again, we didn't \u2013 that didn\u2019t run through FFO at that quarter either. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Thanks, hi. David, you said that redevelopment of the Premium Outlet portfolio may be picking up. Curious what's driving that, are you just adding more GLA to meet demand or are you going to be doing something different to those centers? David Simon : Well, I think in some cases absolutely we have gone back to kind of the - you know take Wrentham as an example. We have a food court that you know we\u2019re not sold on, that's the best use. And what do we do with that box to it up and then make it more customer friendly. And I just think it's been a matter of - you know, we've been so busy in developing new centers that you know that was the focus and as that\u2019s changed to some degree, we\u2019re just going back to the portfolio and mining the opportunities much like we did with the mall business. Now I will say, we've got you know, a couple of major new developments in the outlet business that we've been working on. So stay tuned on those, but you know, those will be exciting developments if in fact they you know they do come to fruition. So we'll still do selective new development in the U.S., but I just think it's a matter of rededicating the resources to going back through the existing portfolio to make sure that you know, they're doing all that they can to continue to be attractive places for the consumer. Rick Sokolov : The other thing we're doing, as David just indicated, if you did any Clarksburg or when you see Denver, you're going to see a much higher level of amenities for our customers, fireplaces, outdoor seating areas, upgraded play and as we go back and look at these properties we're implementing those incremental amenities throughout our portfolio with very good results. Michael Mueller : It sounds good. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Good morning. This is Keyvan. David Simon : Morning Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. So David, I just wanted to go back to your comment about leasing improving, if you can just talk a little bit more about what's behind that and how much of the improvement in leasing volume or whatever you're referring to is tied to Simon improving the merchandise mix at the malls through redevelopment or just changing retailers or how much of it is it the older guard of retailers just doing better on improved strategy or merchandising. And lastly, how much of it is just a better economy. I mean, retail is supposed to do well and a 4% unemployment economy, right? David Simon : Well, listen I think all of the above is the simple, I can't break it down by percentage. But you know, but the reality is our portfolio, our common area or a small shop is so big that there's not \u2013 there is just no way that one thing can move in one direction or another. It's just mathematically impossible. So you know, listen the growth in the economy is terrific. We're very pleased to have seen it. And obviously is consumer is spending more. That's terrific. We haven't seen that for a number of years. A number of our retailers are getting better and healthier. And I think the tax cut on their business gave them more earnings to invest or replenish their merchandise. We're working through a number of the bankruptcies and replacing them with better retailers. We're upgrading our mix, so you put it all together and I think that's what's generated at least the increase in sales. But you know, it's just mathematically impossible for one thing to move it one way or another. I wish I had maybe I should, I wish I knew exactly how to calibrate which of the three or four categories you mentioned, which is driving it, but I think it's all in that number, it's all or part of it. I mean, I don\u2019t \u2013 I the retailers to some extent were playing defense and now they're playing a little more offense. But you know it's impossible for me to tell you what you know, what by category, but I'd say it's all of the above. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just last on CapEx. I know that number can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. The CapEx offered per square foot did that change at all the trend wise over the past couple quarters? David Simon : Not really. I mean, and I do think you mentioned a good point. I mean, there is quarter-to-quarter variance, if you look at it, you should look at it that 12 months or on an annual basis and you'll see it is not a lot - there's not a lot of difference. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. David Simon : Morning. Caitlin Burrows : I have two shorter ones, just on the densification projects, you guys now indicate with an asterisk which project Simon has an ownership interest in, so I just was wondering for those that do not have an asterisk, does, somebody else own them. Did you contribute the land? Or kind of what's going on at those other properties? David Simon : Well, in some cases, we contributed the land or sold the land. But in a lot of cases it's just - it's further validation of the location that we have that there is a lot more going on and that you know, in that parcel than you know - than what we're doing. So, I think it's - it goes under the category of helpful information maybe I guess, I don't \u2013 and I don't get overly excited. I care about what we do, but it's always good to have better neighbours. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. So just looking at one that doesn't have one, like Coconut Point in Estero, that opened last year with a hotel, that just means that it's something that somebody else was doing. But it should help our sensor, is that right category\u2026 David Simon : Correct. That\u2019s correct. Rick Sokolov : We sold them the land as part of our master plan development. We had a parcel that we designated for hotel development. It was across the road from our existing project, so it wasn't integrated and it was just a sale, but it certainly enhances our overall environment. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then the other was just, I know its small portion, wondering if you could give any update on Puerto Rico properties that you have. If they're - to what extent they're back to where they were a year ago or if they still have more catch up do? David Simon : They have - they continue to have a significant amount of catch up to do. And I'd say the outlet, the Premium Outlet is in much better shape, the mall because you know, it's easier and faster to build an outlet store than it is a mall. The mall is taking a little bit more time to get back up on its feet. We're hopeful by the end of this year, it will continue. But you know, there's a lot of work to be done and more in the mall than in the outlet at this point. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys. I am just curious, David, occupancy costs, say, ticked below about 1.3% for the first time, I think since about 2016. Now that tenant sales are moving more strongly forward. I know I'm asking you to predict retail sales, but I'm just curious you know, longer term how do you think about occupancy costs, do you expect them to return to sort of the 11% to 12% range what you saw years ago that seemed to be where you stabilized or do you think you can hold the 13% peak that we've been operating at? David Simon : Well, you know, that's a real tough one. I mean, I - there's so much that goes into that beyond you know - it's space by space, it's supply and demand. It's the model that you know, the high end retailers have much more margin on their product, and so they can pay a higher occupancy cost. I mean, I don't think there's any real generic statement that I can give to you, other than I think we're you know pretty good at trying to price our real estate. But you know, we have to price in a way that the retailer is profitable. So I wish you it were more science than art because then it would solve a lot of problems and be even more efficient than we already are. I can just do an algorithm and say here's the price of the real estate. But the reality is it's not quite that simple. And you know, I just \u2013 I can't predict where that will go though. I'm not alarmed that you know suddenly we're going to you know - it's going to have to go lower and lower. I just don't - I just - you know I'm not alarmed, I'm not worried about it. Jeff Donnelly : And or in other words, like you don't get the message from your retailers that they need more occupancy costs because of more pressure on their operating margins? David Simon : Well, we certainly - we get that every day, but we've gotten that every day for you know, I don't know how long. So, yeah, there's always a big discussion on that. And you know, I mean, it's retailer by retailer, it's a location, it's you know, again, there's so much more margin on their product \u2013 our product is so much different then and when I call you know, you can put it all together in Class A office you know, it's very on commodity like, because there's so much to it because of the location, the traffic, the mall, the competition, et cetera, et cetera. So you know, it's very hard to do it, the way you might see traditional real estate priced. So \u2013 but we try to find that happy medium and you know, we're not - we're going to not be - you know, we're going to lose deals so in some cases we didn't, but we tried to find the happy medium. Jeff Donnelly : Analyst just some of our peers have been increasing with the penetration of you know, their exposure to restaurants and entertainment as they sort of merchandise the mall. How do you guys balance the relevancy of your merchandising, in this case the restaurants versus the higher costs of those deals and maybe the higher turnover risk of restaurants, just so you're not effectively jumping from one risk to another? Because there is a lot of studies out there that say maybe saying we're getting a little over restaurant, I'm just curious what your thoughts are. David Simon : Well, I think the most important thing is making sure you have the right brand, and you know, like others we've got a dedicated team that focuses on those opportunities both entertainment and in the restaurants. And it's really a function of making sure you have the ability to know how they're going to do, we have - how many restaurants we have Rick? Rick Sokolov : We have literally 1750 food users in our mall portfolio. David Simon : So I mean, that gives us a lot of experiences, what's going to work and what's not. And believe me you know Jeff, we take we take risks there. We experiment and sometimes we crap out. But you know, that's part of the job. I mean, we've got to - sometimes we've got to invest in the new restauranteur to see if this is something that will add value to that center and then maybe go beyond that center. Now when we do that we're very good at making sure it's lean free. We're very sure we'll get the improvements that kitchen won't be ripped out, so you know that operator happens not to be the right operator, we don\u2019t start out. That to me is the key on any of these new concepts, as you got to make sure that if you do take a little more risk than you do then you want to at the end of the day you've got a restaurant or a facility that\u2019s easier to lease and you don't have to reinvest again you know, you reduce costs. So you're investing a space that you can monetize over longer period of time. Jeff Donnelly : Maybe just one last one, on leasing spreads just a housekeeping aspect. Do you have NOI weighted leasing spreads for Q1 and Q2 this year? David Simon : We do not Tom we don\u2019t tend to give it out, but Tom will give it out to you maybe if he is in a good mood. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. David Simon : I determine whether he is at a good mood or not. Tom Ward : Just kidding. I am just kidding. David Simon : Well, maybe I am not. All right. Where we can, I know we done that. I don't know why, but we like, okay. Thank you. Jeff Donnelly : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David Simon :  Good morning. Christy McElroy : It seems like with the Toys Toys\"R\"Us liquidation, there was less - a bit of a hole for some brands from a distribution standpoint. Are you seeing any residual impact from any of those brands seeking other distribution channels, maybe looking to open stores as an added direct to consumer distribution point, particularly maybe on the outlet and maybe it's not specific to choice it just trying to think about the residual impact from the fall out that\u2019s occurred in the last year or so? Rick Sokolov : There's no doubt that the manufacturers are very focused on how they're going to distribute their goods. We are working with a number of potential retailers that are looking to be able to replace, primarily the specialty store component that Toys\"R\"Us had in our portfolio. And we're optimistic - we're going to be able to come up with a couple of tenants that are going to want to take advantage of that and we're working with the manufacturers directly because they also are focused on how they're going to distribute their goods in that channel. David Simon : Yeah. You know, Christy, I would say for sure though there is definitely going to - just on the Toys issue there \u2013 would shock me, and you know, and maybe who knows. But it would shock me if there's not a toy retailer that you know re-emerges from the Toys\"R\"Us debacle because I do think you know, there is a reason to buy toys in the physical environment. So again, I mean, that toys thing was a debacle of massive proportions, but there is no question and there's a number of people that you know that are out there, that are thinking about how to create a new generational toy a physical toy retail experience. And in fact, I mean, I don't know if you know this Christy, but you'll see FAO Schwarz open up, I believe Q4, maybe even earlier in Rockefeller Center with their latest version on what FAO will look like going forward. So you know, again, there's no question that that will \u2013 that will I think will happen, we'll see. Christy McElroy : I am sure. And it definitely has to be something more experiential. Just on the leasing side, in your traditional shop leasing, can you talk about any changes that you're making or looking to make to the language in the lease contracts, when it comes to things like cotenancy clauses and sales calculations, just given the changes to shopping that's occurred in shopping center format? David Simon : Yeah, I think all of those - given the business continues to change and evolve, there is always - first of all we don't like them but you know, reality is we have to deal with them and there's always modifications and changes, that we have to deal with, because there's going to be you know, as we know Sears, many - certain other department stores. So we always have to modify those things. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just lastly on the guidance increase, it seemed like a majority of that increase was inherent in the gain on the Authentic Brands conversion. Is that accurate? Or have you included any of that, have you anticipated that in your prior guidance. I'm just trying to think about, things on the core side... David Simon : Yeah, that's a very good question and I thank you for asking it. We always knew that we were going to convert that. And that was always in our original guidance. So again, I mean, we're a business, we're not just - you know we try to give this guidance and there's a lot - as you know we've got - we're not just 10 more - I mean we've got an ongoing, living, breathing business. But that was always contemplated. Our partner had done it earlier. I can't really remember when they did it. We were debating whether to do it or not. But we've felt like it was likely to do, so in our original guidance we did it. And so the increase that we have today is above and beyond that because that was in the original guidance. Christy McElroy : Okay. Any other big items like that that we should be thinking about as we towards the second half? David Simon : Nothing jumps out of me. Christy McElroy : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital. Your line is open. Wes Golladay : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to Puerto Rico. Are you receiving any business interruption insurance? And are you looking, I guess, what is the lost in NOI for the year? David Simon : Well, that's not in our numbers and we don't book BI until we actually receive it. And in fact, if you see some of the P&L changes and reduction in minimum rents and tenant reimbursements, a lot of that is due to the Puerto Rico situation. So none of that's in our guidance, I'm sorry none of that\u2019s in our \u2013 none of that has been received and it's not in our guidance at this point. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then looking to the second half for same store NOI base rent, do you expect a meaningful lift from converting temporary tenants to permanent tenants? David Simon : No I mean, we don't look at it quite that way. And as you know, we give our same store comp NOI at the beginning of the year and then you know, whatever the number is, the number is. We do our best to do a little bit better than what the number is. Wes Golladay : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking the question. David Simon : Sure. No worries. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Simon, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks. David Simon : All right. Thank you very much and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. We're pleased to report another record quarter with continued strong operating and financial results. Our investment in our product remains unabated with a long-term view of creating compelling integrated environments with critical mass that service the hub of retail, dining, entertainment and socializing within their communities. We completed several significant new developments and redevelopments in the quarter or under construction and others and announced more transformational mixed-use activity that will further enhance the value of our real estate and grow our cash flow. Turning to the results, highlighted FFO by $1.90 billion or $3.05 per share, an increase of 5.5% per share compared to the prior year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.1% or approximately $188 million to-date. Comp NOI increased 2.3% for the year-to-date period. Leasing activity remains solid. Average base rent was $53.88, up 2.8% compared to last year. The Mall and Premium Outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.59 per square foot, an increase of 13.9%. We're pleased that retailer sales momentum continued in the third quarter. Our Mall and Premium Outlets was $650 compared to $622 in the prior year period per foot, an increase of 4.5%, and sales were strong across the portfolio in the third quarter. Retail sales productivity has increased each month over the last 12 consecutive months. Occupancy at the end of the quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 80 basis points for the second quarter and an increase of 20 basis points compared to prior years. On an NOI weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows. Retail sales would be $817 per foot compared to $650, occupancy would be 96.3% compared to 95.5% and average base minimum rent would be $71.21 compared to $53.88. At the end of September, we opened Denver Premium Outlet. Center is fully leased. It's off to great start. Center is another terrific asset within a great portfolio and a great location and a strong and growing market. Construction continues on two international outlets, expected to open in 2019, Queretaro, Mexico and Malaga, Spain. And we announced a 50-50 joint venture with Macerich to create Los Angeles Premium Outlets. This will be an exciting project on fantastic real estate and obviously one of the country's most attractive markets. Now at the end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing across all of our platforms in the U.S. internationally, and internationally, we started construction on significant expansions of Paju Premium Outlets in Seoul and Tosu Premium Outlets in Japan. Last week, we held the ground-breaking of our landmark mixed-use transformation at Phipps Plaza that will include Atlanta's first Nobu Hotel and Restaurant, a Class A office building, a Life Time athletic resort, food hall and outdoor community gathering space, all in the area of one department store that we reclaimed. We also announced our transformational vision for Northgate in Seattle. We're thrilled to collaborate with NHL Seattle, make their training center and corporate headquarters, an enterable element of the re-imagined at Northgate Community. This project is a prime example of our unique ability to repurpose our well-located real estate, create compelling ways for consumers to live, work, play, stay, shop and now skate at our destination. Now, Sears, over the last several years, as you know, including what we just recently did at Phipps, we have reclaimed a number of our unproductive department stores in our portfolio. The reclamation of unproductive space, specifically some department stores, is an unprecedented opportunity for us to dramatically enhance the productivity of the space, our centers overall. And we will continue to proactively recapture additional stores to further enhance our centers. The SPG portfolio currently has 33 Sears stores that Sears has closed or announced they will be closed. Of those 33 stores, we have, through proactive action, controlled 22 of those 33, five of which are in our joint venture with Seritage. Of those 17 that we control, Sears will no longer exist in 2019. They will be demolished, replaced and redeveloped. Now, turning back to the 33 that Sears owns and controls, five that will be closing, and Seritage controls six for the total of 33, not including the ones in our joint venture. And they are \u2013 Seritage is the process of redeveloping those and are in construction \u2013 under construction with six of those former Sears stores. The remaining, we have 29 that are currently operating, eight are owned by us and leased to Sears, four owned by Seritage and leased to Sears, and 17 are owned by Sears. Turning to capital markets, during the first nine months, we closed on 13 mortgages, totaling approximately $3 billion, of which our share is approximately $1.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.83%, term of 8.4. We have the highest investment-grade credit rating in the industry. Our net to EBITDA was 5.4 times. Our interest coverage is 5 times, which is well in excess of our peers, well in excess on both fronts. Our current liquidity is $7 billion. We continue to have excess cash flow, which we can reinvest in our business. Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. And we're approaching the $100 per share dividend since we've been public, which we will celebrate in December. So $100 per share have been paid to the shareholders roughly in dividends through our public company existence. Our total dividend payment will be $7.90 in 2018, which is an increase of 10.5% compared to last year. Now turning to guidance, we once again raised our full year guidance to $12.09 to $12.13. Just to keep in mind, this is an updated range compared to our \u2013 updated range includes \u2013 compared to our original guidance of $11.90 to $12.02. And this new range is a growth of approximately 7.9% to 8.2% compared to our reported FFO of last year. So, we're ready for questions. But before I turn it over, we had a very strong quarter and we continue to grow our cash flow. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : I just wonder, if you or Rick, could you just talk maybe a little bit about the leasing environment? And as you sit here today, looking forward, maybe just reflect on the last year and how you felt maybe a year ago and just sort of give us a flavor for the leasing environment? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we tend to take a longer term view, so we can talk about quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year, but as you know, we take a longer term view. And I would say, certainly, our long-term view has not changed. The activity has increased from 2017 to 2018. I think there's clearly \u2013 for the retailers that are investing in their product, there's increased sales. As you know, we showed you that. And I'd say it's certainly generally better than last year, but again, you've got to take a longer term view. We have more activity going on. There's more new concepts on the restaurant, entertainment, overall retail. You've got the folks that start out on the Internet that want to own physical stores. So, I'd say, generally, the environment is better. But, as you know, we never really were overly concerned about maybe a less robust leasing environment in 2017 because we tend to take longer term views of this. Happy for Rick to add anything he would like to this. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The only thing that I would add is that there is, I sense, an acceleration. Last year at this time, I think people were talking, but there was less aggressive approach to opening new stores. I think as David said, the people that are well positioned are now more encouraged to open stores. Obviously, sales are better, the profitability is better. And we are very well positioned. We don't talk about it a lot, but every day, every one of our properties is getting better because of the capital we're spending. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay, David, just secondly, I just noticed on the leasing spreads information you provide on page 22 of the supplemental, there was a pretty big jump in the square footage of openings and a pretty sharp decline in the average rent per foot. I realize these are trailing 12-month figures, but it almost appears like maybe a different set of assets is being compared now. Do you have any comments on that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. We're \u2013 again, I \u2013 what's the most important thing that I focus on... Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : (00:13:38) David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: ... just so we're clear. You got it. And the operating metrics, it's funny. Just to take a step back. So when sales were \u2013 it's always like, okay, what's the operating metrics du jour. Okay. And the reality is our business is changing in that we're going to be recapturing these boxes that pay very low rent and we're carving them up. And we're now showing to you that love metrics, okay, the importance of the embedded growth in our business by recapturing these leases that pay very low rent. So we put all of our openings and all of our closings in that number so that you can see the embedded market rent growth that we have in our business. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, just in the other income, I know there were different components, and last year, you had some securities gains. And this year, you didn't. But is there is any \u2013 there was a big jump in the other income. And I just know there's a lot of different things that run through that, but are there any comments or things you can share. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. So last year, as you know, we sold the Seritage stock at $48.49 (00:14:59), which I think if I look today, it was a pretty good trade to sell it at that rate. In other income, we did get our business interruption, not all of it, but some of it from Puerto Rico. And that's what's in other income. It doesn't flow through the operating numbers. That was \u2013 we always had planned to get that and it's always been in our numbers, but you can't book that until you actually get the cash from that according to GAAP. And then, we got some of that BI in the third quarter. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. Is there a number you could share with us that's kind of embedded in that other income or - David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's the big jump in that \u2013 the vast majority of it, yeah. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay, it's a vast majority of the $20 million increase. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct. And it really is \u2013 now, so you know, we always planned on getting to BI. You just can't show it in your normal minimum rent or CAM recoveries or any of that information. It's got to be in other income. Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's it for me. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, no worries. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David, can you just elaborate a little bit on Sears. You were named to the creditors' committee yesterday, so maybe talk a little bit about the role that you plan to play there. And you went through a lot of different numbers in terms of the Sears boxes. If you just look sequentially, you went from 59 effectively down to 46, which includes the 17, which are closing. So, there's 13 stores during the quarter that fell out. I wasn't sure whether those were recaptured during the quarter and form part of some redevelopment plan. But just looking sequentially, sub-to-sub, 59 to 46, inclusive of the 17 that are closing. Just to trying to get some color there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think the thing to focus on, we're putting Sears in our rearview mirror. Okay? So what we're trying to explain \u2013 and there are a lot of moving boxes and obviously, the whole situation is a tragic, frankly. Put aside, how it affects us, we think this is a unique opportunity. We're going to redevelop this. We're going to generate positive momentum with the properties due to this. We're going to reinvest in the communities. We're going to be able to drive traffic now from this box. Put all of that aside, we're going to be able to make money on this. Put that all aside, if I may, and just it's a tragic set of events that a company that's been around for so long is in this state of affairs. So that to us is \u2013 that's what I think about. It wasn't that long ago, 10, 12 years ago, that 300,000 people worked at Sears. Okay? So I mean, I think we should put that in perspective. But let's focus on what we \u2013 the task at hand. And what I'm trying to do \u2013 and there are a lot of moving parts, but basically \u2013 and what I explained \u2013 I'm sure I garbled some because you know I have a hard time spitting out words. But the reality is, we have 33 stores that are closed or in the process of closed at the end of this year. We control 22 of those and 5 of those are in our joint venture with Seritage. Of the 17 that we have unmitigated control, Sears will no longer exist in 2019. They will either be torn down, redeveloped, re-leased, but they'll be in our rearview mirror. So we are effectively down to 29 operating stores. We own 8, Seritage owns 4, and then the 17 are owned by Sears. And we'll have to wait and see what happens on the \u2013 in terms of whether they'll continue to operate those or not. Obviously, we're planning for the ultimate unfortunate demise of Sears and we're ready for it. And we have the balance sheet and the capital with intellectual and human resources to deal with these set of events. So, that's what I would focus on. The other thing to keep in mind is that there's also Seritage that owns some in that. And they've done a reasonable job of re-leasing some of their space. So those are the numbers that I would focus on. And it's still moving around because they \u2013 some are closed, some aren't, but those are the numbers. And at the end of the day, next year, we'll report 29 Sears stores. That's it. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. It sounds like there was at least 11 that are controlled by others, other than you and Seritage, that closed during the quarter, (00:20:32) in that 33 to 22, right? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's correct. Sears owns the balance of those. That's correct. That's correct. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: But the creditors' committee and sort of your role there and Rick mentioned not a big competitor. (00:20:45) David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There is no comment that I can have on that where we \u2013 for better or worse, we tend to be on creditors' committees with large unfortunate bankruptcies of retailers. So, we have a certain expertise in that. We'll see how it all plays out. But beyond that I can't \u2013 I really can't comment. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit about international in terms of what's happening there? Obviously, Kl\u00e9pierre, its shares have come down meaningfully alongside a lot of other real estate stocks in Europe. There's obviously been consolidation activity going on there, in part, Kl\u00e9pierre tried to make the bid for Hammerson when Hammerson went after Intu. And now, Intu has its own consortia bid from their main shareholder alongside capital sources. How are you thinking about Europe overall both of your investment in Kl\u00e9pierre but then also consolidation opportunities in that region, whether that would be Simon-led or Kl\u00e9pierre-led? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well that was \u2013 I would classify that as add on sentence, but let's put that aside. I am very comfortable with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre. They have \u2013 I mean, I have to look at the long-term prospects of that company, measured against kind of the short-term volatility. And from a long-term perspective, I don't really see any real change. There's very little new development. They have a lot of redevelopment activity. There are good operators getting better. So our investment is solid, and stocks go up, stocks go down. We take a long-term view. We have exposure in Europe not only through Kl\u00e9pierre but obviously through McArthurGlen and through our interest in value retail. I would tell you that the market generally ignores and underestimate the value that we have outside of the U.S., whether that's Mexico, Europe, Asia. There is no appreciation of the value that we've created in that. That's fine. We continue to do what we do. I don't really \u2013 I think we mentioned briefly what Kl\u00e9pierre did on Hammerson, that's in their rearview mirror. I think that's better coming from them. I think the CEO's made that clear to investors. Not much I can add to that. And there's nothing I can add to what's going on with Intu. I mean we don't \u2013 as they say, we don't have a dog in that hunt, so here in Indiana that is. So, I continue to think Europe is fine. It's certainly \u2013 I think the trend there is similar to ours and that the better assets will get better, and the ones that are smaller unless they're uniquely positioned will be put under pressure, but even the better ones will grow, will offset whatever diminution might have happened on the little ones. So I generally feel pretty good. I mean there are parts in Europe that you might want to avoid i.e. Turkey and other places like that, given that currency in the lira and what happens on that front, but generally, I think it's okay. Look, I'm sure the Kl\u00e9pierre team has a focus on Italy, what's going on there, you have Brexit. So you could certainly take a contrarian view at the right time. We did that in 2012 when we invested in Kl\u00e9pierre. Could we be coming into another contrarian point of view, perhaps, but we're really not overly active other than making sure our investments grow in value. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just going back to the Sears boxes in terms of the 17 that you expected to close by year end, the 22, including the Seritage JV. I know it's a little early here still, but can you just sort of frame it out from a timing and capital allocation perspective in terms of how much of this you really think will fall into redevelopment, potentially kickoff some larger redevelopments? And what sort of rough capital investment this could possibly represent? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, remember, part of \u2013 the vast majority of the 17 of the 22, we actually transacted to get back \u2013 when was that? Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.: November. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: November. Okay. So remember that just to put that in perspective. So those plans are already moving. I mean, not \u2013 just to name a few Northshore, Cape Cod... Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Brea, David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Brea, Stoneridge... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Broadway. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: ...Broadway, Midland, just to name a few, so all of those are coming online. And that's why I made the comment that the 17 that we control, Sears is going to be gone. There won't be \u2013 you won't \u2013 there will not be a Sears. It will be either gone, under construction or will take the box and there'll be a new retailer hopefully open by then, but obviously it does take time. So the 22 of the 33 are basically all under redevelopment. The capital of that is over $1 billion. That's always been in our plan. And there is no surprise there. And so that's \u2013 that we are moving at a high level to redevelop those boxes as quickly and as smartly as we can. Then, there's 11 that Sears and Seritage own, that we're not involved in. I think Seritage of those six \u2013 and again, there's a lot of numbers here, that's why I'm repeating myself and I appreciate the question, of those six, Seritage has already redeveloped over half of those. So those are moving \u2013 they're doing those independently in conjunction with us, but independently. And that's fine. And then, there's five that Sears owns and then, we'll see what happens with that real estate. And I think it's a blanket statement that we would love to own at the right price any of the real estate that we don't control. And so we \u2013 patience, seeing how this plays out is important. So I hope that answers it, but it will be well over $1 billion. You'll start to see in the 8-K this stuff as we approve it. I don't know. I'm asking Tom. I don't know. We just approved Cape Cod, Northshore... Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There are some in there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There are some in there. So you're going to see it. We have a busy capital appropriations committee. We approved three or four, Monday, you'll see those in the fourth quarter numbers. So it's all moving, it's all moving quickly. And I would tell you, generally, other than, obviously, to see a retailer like Sears end up where it is, I mean this will be fine for us. We'll add value to the real estate. We wish it would have been done in a different manner, but we have to confront what we have to confront. And I think we'll make this \u2013 it'll be an opportunity for us just like everything else we've dealt with over the last 25 years as a public company. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): No, I appreciate that color call. And as we see that start to come on to the development pipeline, I mean, is it fair to assume the same kind of yield you've been achieving at 7% to 8% on redevelopments or would it be higher than that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. No, look, as you know, every deal is different, but that would be our goal. That would be our goal for sure. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great, and second one for me. Just going back to the leasing commentary about the environment being a little better here today. Are you starting to see this translate into year leases as well in terms of timing to get deals done, terms, leasing capital, or is it more just on the activity front at this point? And then, in terms of rents, we've talked about this before, but you're not necessarily getting the benefit of sales in an area move online, but you do feel the returns at the store level. So to that end, are you starting to push occupancy costs to account for that leakage or you're looking at other metrics to understand tenant profitability and therefore what a tenant can pay and are tenants accepting that this old model maybe needs to change or is it just more of an educational process on both sides still at this point? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: This is Rick. Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground. Let me take it apart. One, our terms, our TA are certainly within the norms that we've established over the years. Our tempo of leasing is accelerating in that we now have more tenants coming in saying, all right, let me look at 5, 10, 15 openings for 2019. That is an acceleration from what we had this time last year. That's encouraging. Our occupancy costs today are the lowest they have been in the last two and a half years. So that's encouraging. And that's taking into account the fact that there is an understatement of sales productivity. All of our leasing agents are totally aware of not that potential but that fact. And as we are pricing our real estate, we are prosecuting that to the extent we can to drive rents. And you've seen our average base rent go up and our spreads are going up. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I would just add though. I mean, retailers are smart and savvy. They are doing what they need to do on their cost structure. And so it's not easy. But like I said, we have a unique position in this industry. We have really quality properties, a lot of scale. We have the ability to think. We have the ability to be patient. We have the ability to say no. We take gambles, we win, we lose, we draw. So we do okay, but it continues to be \u2013 it's not \u2013 there're still very thoughtful negotiations. Everybody is focused on increasing their profitability. They're no different with us. And we try as hard as we can to create a decent win-win scenario. And then, when we do that, the math spits out. But it's better than it was last year. In the long run, we have no worries about where we're going to be. And I think as we continue to redevelop, we're going to make these properties fantastic. But in the meantime, we're going to be in this spot where it's going to be a thoughtful, diligent, but appropriately focused negotiation between us and our best clients. Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for the time. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Hi, Craig. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. I noticed on your redevelopment activity, the yields for the Premium Outlet redevs went from 10% to 11% and The Mills went from 11% to 13%. I just wondered what was pushing those returns. And is it perhaps that the leasing is going better at these redevelopment efforts? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I wouldn't \u2013 those are hard to like extrapolate trends. I think it's just a function of mix. Nothing that really jumps out. But I'm sure we'll look at it and Tom could answer, but I just think it's probably just mix off the top of my head, nothing major. We do have the ability, I think, to continue to add value through our redevelopment, new development efforts. And it goes up and it will go down, but it will \u2013 that gives you the directional idea of kind of where things are. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So, I mean, it's clear that although the construction costs are going up that it really isn't impacting your returns on these. (00:36:02) David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, that's a good question and let me just say this. Everything \u2013 we are \u2013 it's a good point and let me address this, this way. I mean, we have no risk at this point and things always change, but at this point, we have absolutely no risk in what we're building today. You always have contingency in there, but nothing what I would say beyond our contingency, and obviously, our contingencies in our 8-K. We are seeing a general increase in construction costs. It's really a market by market scenario, but the potential rise of those cost are not in any way at the point where we're saying we can't make the numbers work. I don't anticipate that happening, but obviously, we're paying attention to it. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then, we keep hearing about new technology in both retail and just the retail center. I wonder if there's anything new that might surprise consumers this holiday season, whether it's an unmanned checkouts or mobile apps, making things more personalized, or virtual or augmented reality. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think, I think we and all sorts of retailers and technology companies are focused on a couple of things, payment, obviously, driving traffic, which could be through a lot of individual personalized promotion, the checkout process and improving that is really important, and then the ease of parking as well. So, lots of experiments, lots of things happening by us and others, by retailers and by technology companies. And I think there is clearly a bounce back on the physical world compared to the pure online Internet, just because I do think payment and ease and convenience can be enhanced by technology in the store environment. So we're looking forward to those introductions into the physical world. I think that will make physical shopping a lot more easier and convenient. And then, obviously, there's so much benefits to physical shopping compared to looking on your phone and trying to buy stuff. And what's fascinating to us, fascinating, and we see it because, remember, we have our (00:39:22) rights, so we can see the high level of returns. The high level of returns that we see from online sales to the physical stores is that never talked about. Okay? But if you wanted to go \u2013 write a research report, Craig, that would be the big focus because everybody wants to say, here's the gross Internet sale, but they don't want to tell you the net. They want to hit the physical world. But the returns are staggering, okay, and especially in the product that I'm discussing. But no one wants to talk about that. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So I understand your frustration, but thank you for your answers. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Well, I'm not frustrated, by the way. Just so it's clear, I'm just saying it's very interesting that no one talks about it. It's just the fact. Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, good morning. Good morning out there, David. So two questions from us. First, you mentioned the international and you think that it's underappreciated, but just curious, I mean, obviously, in the U.S., you guys have a very efficient platform, but globally, you're definitely spread out. So just sort of curious, how you would compare your overseas platforms' efficiency to the U.S. And then, as you expand into like Thailand or the Middle East, how those markets are initially versus once you get a concentration of assets? Do you really see a material improvement in operations or the Premium Outlets work very well as a standalone or in clusters? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I'd say both. I mean the reality is our joint ventures with the Premium Outlet business has its own group of personnel. So they can add \u2013 as they add product to their platform, I mean they get scale. It's safe to say no one \u2013 none of our investments overseas has anywhere near the scale and the overhead metrics that we have. I mean our overhead metrics are underappreciated. I mean, Tom, can give you the numbers, but many of our peers are at 10% of NOI and we're at 3%, what, give me the numbers? Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We're at 3%. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We're at 3% and they're 8%, 9%, 10%. So all of our places don't have quite that scale. I could certainly \u2013 if I wanted to or could, I could certainly probably find a way to scale, but they're doing. And so it is what it is. So they all benefit from adding good product to their platforms. I would say none of them have the scale that we do and we don't impose our scale to them at all. And I don't think that we will, but you can't rule it out. And if we did, I am sure we could do it \u2013 we could have better results, but at the moment, everything is good, so we let it go. Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then, the second question is, you guys \u2013 in the last call, you talked about converting retail to other uses and obviously, you had the deal out in Northgate where it looks to be sort of cutting the mall in half. As you guys increasingly go through, is there like basically a \u2013 not exact percentage but a view of how much existing retail you could do without to replace with things like apartments or hotels or office versus how much you would increase the overall square footage of your properties to add incremental uses? So trying to get a sense of how much of your existing retail would you scale back to increase uses versus how much of the new mix uses would be incremental to the existing retail that's already there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's hard to give you a number, but let me look at it this way. Okay? So, I think the greatest opportunity that we have, I think we're in good shape with small shop. There's always going to be a mall here or there that has too much small shops but I think we're in decent shape there. And so what we have the opportunity to do, and we are doing, is we probably \u2013 the mall of the future doesn't need five, six, three, it depends on the mall, but doesn't need the department stores. And then, the ability to reclaim that allows us to densify the properties, and I think we have that opportunity in a rather large scale. So, again, this is where we suffer maybe from the scope of what we do and all the activity that we have, but take Phipps as an example. So this is \u2013 was that put in the 8-K or not? Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. So it's in the 8-K now. All right. So, take Phipps, we had one department store, Belk, that was 140,000...? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: 160,000. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: 160,000. Thank you, Rick. We are adding essentially 300 plus \u2013 well, we have the hotel \u2013 the office is 324,000, right? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: (00:45:35) David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And the hotel is - Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.: (00:45:39) David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: How big is that? Whatever, okay, so let's say, we're adding 500,000 square feet in something that was doing 160,000 \u2013 that was taking up 160,000 square feet. And I encourage you to look at the renderings. Do we have the renderings on our website? Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We can get them out. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. We should, let's get them. Do you have the video with me, and Mr. De Niro and the Chef Nobu on our website, and Rick? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's right. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Because (00:46:09) it's out there. Okay. So we won't, but we will do that. And Northgate, you say the mall cutting to half. I've got to tell you, Northgate is so much bigger than that. And again, we have up to 800-plus apartments. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: 1,200 apartments. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: 1,200. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Frankly, we're going to have 1,200 apartments, 600,000 feet of retail. We're going to have probably 600,000 feet of office and the NHL Seattle training facility. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. So I mean, the scope of some of these things are really large, but if you're looking for \u2013 here's the number. I can't give it to you, other than as these \u2013 we do feel like there's a lot of fun stuff to do. It's aggravating in the sense that it's \u2013 you have to herd all (00:47:05) that catch in terms of accomplishment. But once we built something \u2013 I mean, like, once we \u2013 now that Phipps will be open hopefully in, and I'm pushing for two years, but maybe two and a half years, I think we're going to be really proud of that and our shareholders will be happy, and Rick and I will have great sushi. So, what else could you want? Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Sounds pretty good. Okay. That perspective is helpful. Thank you, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. So, your dividend is going to be up 10.5% this year, which is great. I guess I was just wondering, considering your growing cash flow, how are you thinking about prioritizing on development and redevelopment where you're obviously very active versus increasing the dividend and potential acquisition opportunities right now? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I'd say to you that I would expect \u2013 obviously, board decision, blah, blah, blah, but we would expect to continue to increase our dividend next year. Clearly, we will be \u2013 our redevelopment is really active and that could be increased. Now, again, the reality is, Caitlin, that it takes time. So take Brea, which we control that Sears store. It's going to be unbelievable, but we have another six months of permitting. So, we're able to \u2013 I'd love to, like, just stuff it all into \u2013 stuff it all into the box and do it all at once, but the reality is we can't because we have external constraints. I wouldn't say necessarily capital constraints at all, but \u2013 so I'm looking at Brian and he's saying, we don't have any, but maybe I tend to be a little conservative on that front. But anyway, we just have constraints on doing the redevelopment only because we've got the permitting and so on and so forth. So that continues to be a big priority. Obviously, new development is not \u2013 in the U.S. is not wildly active. Though, I will tell you that the deal with Macerich I think is going to be a really good project, but that's a three year project essentially. Okay? So that takes time, and that we are really \u2013 we think that's going to be really a good deal. We've got another one in the works in another area of the country and probably two more outlets that we're going to build, but again, those are over \u2013 one could be a little quicker, but two years or so. So that continues to be a focus. Internationally, it's basically we take our cash flow there and reinvest it. So it's not what I'd call Simon capital. We're actually not writing. Yeah, we may not get repatriation back to us, but we're basically doing what many thoughtful companies do is they take profits and they reinvest it and have more profits and keep doing it until they can't do it anymore. So we don't see that. And so then the next thing is, look, we're going to \u2013 we still have \u2013 if the market doesn't like our business or doesn't like what we're doing, we still have a focus on buying stock back. And then, we're not all that active in the acquisition area. We could do a deal here or there. We certainly are interested in reclaiming at the right price certain department stores. And that's kind of how we're thinking about the world right now. I hope that's helpful. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: It is. And just in terms of the time it takes, is there any \u2013 I think there's some concern out there with the amount of department store reclaims that you have and everyone else does, that finding new uses is taking longer. Is that part of it or is it not? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Not with us. No, no, no, no. Sorry. No way. That's not our issue. Our issue is execution, permitting. It has nothing to do with demand, supply and demand, and has nothing to do with capital. That's not us. Sorry. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great to hear. And then maybe just last quickly. Looks like you guys have $600 million of 2.2% debt maturing in early 2019. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, just wondering the plans to address that. And if it were a 10-year unsecured deal, what you think the rate could be? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, we'll either use our cash or \u2013 certainly our \u2013 we have $7 billion available. So, that's just basically standard operating procedure. No big deal there. We could go to the unsecured market. Obviously, there's a lot of rate volatility today. We wouldn't probably do it today, but we'll have to wait and see kind of where the world shakes up. Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything. Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think our cost of money today on a 10-year basis would be about $4.8 billion (00:52:47). But we have \u2013 as David said, we've got over $7 billion of liquidity, so we have plenty of options to address the upcoming maturity. It is not only maturity we have in 2019. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. And I would say to you, what's fascinating, we have very, very little debt coming due in 2019 or 2020, yeah, both on the unsecured and secured basis. So, we're in a very good spot to do that. And I would also \u2013 again, it's overlooked, but if you look at our peers, internationally north of the border, domestic, Far East, nobody has our balance sheet. Nobody is 5 times debt to EBITDA, nobody. People are 2x of us. Not 7, but 10 plus. Please appreciate that. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: (00:54:03) commentary. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. So, you broke up there, but anyway. So we're in good shape there and we'll see what happens on that front. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. David, I can't wait for you to co-star in De Niro's next film. I guess a question for both of you, Rick and David. And I'm just curious in situations where you guys have redeveloped anchor boxes, do you have any statistics you can share on the change in foot traffic sales or asking rents of the property since the new anchor opened? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: God, we'd have to \u2013 I'm sure we could put some together. Here's what's interesting, that we're seeing \u2013 and again, I wouldn't like \u2013 this is anecdotal. So don't (00:55:03) and I don't know if this means anything and so it's too early. But we've had department store closings in the portfolio. There's no hiding that, right. And we have seen \u2013 and again, nothing drives our business \u2013 this does not drive our business one way or another because the size of the portfolio. But what we've seen, which is actually encouraging, is that the in-line sales are actually getting the benefit of the department store closures. And we're also seeing some of the other department stores pick that business up. So at the end of the day, like I said, maybe our industry got just too carried away with having all these big department store boxes. As we transition to the smaller, more appropriately sized group, and there'll be centers that lose in that and like we may have one or two that were nervous about, the reality is the rest of that center, and we will get a better and bigger benefit, I think we'll get healthier, and we're starting to see that. But again, I'd say that's anecdotal and nothing to quantify. But we are seeing that in some of these cases, which I think is encouraging. And that's what we want. We don't need all of those. We don't really get much of an economic benefit from those boxes. We've taken over driving the traffic to the center from those boxes as that would have been in the historical reason to have them. So this could be healthy, other than Rick and I pull our hair out, we want every box leased, we want everything redeveloped, the teams moving really hard and everybody is like, we're playing very hard here to make this stuff happen quick. I mean that's the downside is that we \u2013 not that we ever have, but we are not coasting, okay? We're not coasting. So not that you should tell sorry for us, but I'm not asking you to, but that's the reality. We're humping and pumping. And I think this will be \u2013 I really think other than, yeah, there will be a couple of losses on the scoreboard for us. But at the end of the day, this will be a good thing for us and likely our entire industry. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The one unambiguous result of replacing these anchors is there's no doubt that our total sales and total footfall at our properties is increasing. Just think about David's example at Phipps. When we're done, we're probably going to have tripled the retail sales, plus have all the hotel traffic, plus the office traffic. So in every instance what we're adding is going to be more productive and more dynamic than what we're replacing. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And I guess, on Sears, I'm curious, were they current on the rents before they filed because typically retailers build up a pre-petition receivable before they file. But it's sounding like some other landlords that they were largely current, which frankly makes it seem like the bankruptcy started out as a (00:59:03) bluff that if they got called out on. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. We're not going to have a bad debt reserve. I think that's correct. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just one last one on Sears. You mentioned about $1 billion of investment for the 22 boxes you're redeveloping. Should people think of that as, I think, a rule of thumb is $40 million to $50 million a box or does that include investment beyond the Sears? I think people are looking for a number there. And I am curious how your return on investment you see in that $1 billion compares to what it's been on prior anchor redevelopments. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think what I would \u2013 the best way to do this is really say to you, Jeff, that we're going to have $1 billion-plus of spend. We've been at this \u2013 Tom, $1 billion for how many years? Six, okay. Six years a $1 billion spend. So I think, Jeff, if you look at what we've been doing, we've been spending $1 billion. And if you look at 2015, 2016, some of that may have been tilted toward new development more than redevelopment. It's now going to tilt more toward redevelopment, but it \u2013 and I think it'll go up, but that $1 billion of spend is not just those 22 boxes. That's a lot of stuff in there. Okay? So, like, Phipps is a $300-plus-million spend. It'll be over two years, two and a half probably, but two years. And that's not Sears. That was an old (01:00:40) store. Northgate, I mean, the Northgate numbers could be much bigger than that, but again, that'll be over three years. And again, that's not a Sears' box. So when I say that $1 billion plus spend, it's like \u2013 it's the vision of what we see on redeveloping our business and it will tilt more toward that. On the other hand, when you add Carson with Macerich and you add a couple more, I mean, I think our spend on average has averaged about $1 billion. It could go up as we add these things. It's not going to go to $2 billion a year, but it could go to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. We're doing our plan for 2019. Tom told me not to invite anybody to our planning process. Correct? Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Correct. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: So I'm officially not inviting anybody. But right now, we're looking at a little over $1.3 billion. So I think it's just more than just Sears. Okay? Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks, guys. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Yeah. It looks like sales growth at The Mills has been similar to the rest of the portfolio. So I'm curious what's enabling you to drive the spreads that are significantly higher there? Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The Mills, they're very well positioned in virtually every market where they operate. They are a unique mix of full price, value, outlet, entertainment, food, they're all 1.5 million to 2 million square feet. And they just are able to attract a very broad segment of shoppers and they're performing well. There's no real magic, but we have a very broad use of potential users there. And we've been able to keep those things very well leased and they're very productive. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is the occupancy cost notably different than the other part of the portfolio? Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. That was it. Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, David. I want to go back to a comment you made. I think at the outset, talking about how maybe your international portfolio has been, not to put in your mouth, undervalued or under appreciated. When I look at your development pipeline, it looks like there is a tremendous amount of focus on international. So how are you thinking about that? I think it's just a little bit above 10% right now as a percentage of NOI. As you think forward over the next five years, do you have a bright line test as to where you want to get it or is it just you're going to do good deals when you can find them? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think, Rich, we don't have a (01:03:50) where we need to be a 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, that's not how we look at it. So the reality is \u2013 and most of that, as you know, is through development that we've made some strategic investments i.e. Kl\u00e9pierre and McArthurGlen that come to mind. And I would \u2013 and remember, we own a decent chunk of value retail. We don't really book any of their earnings. And we've had this discussion, we only book when we get cash, which is cash distributions, which is basically cost accounting for those of you who remember cost accounting, which I do. But long story short, we don't really have a \u2013 I don't have any desire to do more. I don't have any desire to do less. I only have desire to make money. So we do think we add value, we do think maybe some of our international partners don't think so, but I think we do. So I think it's more deal-driven, but it's an important part of our business and we will continue to invest in our platforms whether it's Japan, Korea. We announced a devolvement in Thailand, which I think will be fantastic. That opens up that whole country. The tourism there is remarkable. I just happen to do a retail tour in Europe and the interest in that is, the Far East \u2013 our Premium Outlet business in the Far East is very \u2013 it has a high level of interest from our retailers. So I just think it's going to be how do we continue to drive and make money from our investments there. No desire one way or another. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. So just one quick follow-up question then, and maybe this is just that in light of (01:06:22) of some global consolidation that we've seen. Do you think landlords have to have global footprint to make money? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I think it can help, but I don't think it's the \u2013 and I've evolved on this. I don't think you need it. I think it can help. I wouldn't do a deal because that was a really important component of that transaction i.e., exporting retailers from one level to another. However, it's not inconsequential. So take an example, I've met and I won't name a name, but I was just in Spain with a large retailer. And the fact that we have a terrific relationship with them in the U.S. and Kl\u00e9pierre has a terrific relationship in Europe, doesn't hurt. But if I had overpaid for the Kl\u00e9pierre stake, that relationship wouldn't make it up. Okay? But I think it is helpful, but it's not a reason to do a deal. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you for that color. I appreciate it. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Hi. So, my question is more numbers focused. I'm just trying to understand the nature of the guidance change. And then, just kind of given the $0.05 beat in 3Q, how comes, it's only the low end of guidance that was raised rather than the high end as well? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, \u2013 I don't know. There's lots of numbers. We're a big company. One deal, one of that is not going to change this that and the other. But obviously, the currency in Europe is a little bit softer than it was. We tend to be conservative. There's nothing to really study or read into that. It was just a number. Okay? Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Fair enough, David. All right. And then - David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: (01:08:54) As I said, it's just the number. Okay? Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : All right. Fair enough. And then, any update in regard to just lease accounting targets we should be expecting for 2019? I know earlier on in the year, you've kind of given us some guidance to that. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. That's the same general number. No change in that. We're not going to \u2013 we'll make that clear when we give our guidance in February. We'll absolutely make it clear. The number that we've told the market more or less is the same number. There's not going to be much change there. And we'll debate whether we should \u2013 we might go a year just saying here's what it would have been before and after just so people do it, but we might not, but you'll see the number. And it's not \u2013 and that's really the only thing that's going to \u2013 with these other new pronouncements, that's the only thing that's really going to be different. And again, it's not a huge number. Yes, basically, 1%. And it's pretty much over that \u2013 so it's 25 basis points per quarter and you can do the math to get to the number. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Great. And then last one for me. Although it's a couple of years out, any other information you can just share about the JV with Macerich? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No. It's a development JV. I think a lot of people from discussions with Macerich are probably familiar with the site. And we take the site over in about a year and then we build. So we're happy to be part of it and we think it'll be a very good LA Premium Outlet Center. So, we don't get the site back until Carson does what they need to do, and the timing on that is roughly a year from now. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hey. Good morning out there. Dave, I guess a question for you on the lease termination environment. Are you guys still \u2013 are you receiving early termination buyout offers from retailers? And what's your appetite or sentiments regarding these early buyout offers? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We have some. It was lower this quarter \u2013 much lower this quarter than a year ago quarter, right. Actually, you can see it in our 8-K. I don't remember the number off the top, like... Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It was $9.8 million for the quarter versus $13.2 million. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, it's down. I'm not a big fan of them, frankly, but we'll do them. I would say we'll do them occasionally. It's certainly \u2013 as you know, it's not in our comp NOI because there is a lot of volatility associated with it. I would say, generally, the buyouts requests are down pretty reasonably, Rick, do you agree? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I agree. There has been less activity this period than we had last year. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, it's down. Occasionally, we get it. I'm not a big fan of it. Look, we'll do it for \u2013 we'll do it for strategic reasons. One is, maybe we're helping the retailer, two is we want the space back, but it's not what we \u2013 I would prefer not to like do a lot of it, but we will do it strategically. And it's basically a function of whether the offer is fair or whether it helps the retailer and what are our prospects for renewing the space quickly. And so all that goes into the blender and then we make a decision one way or another. But we don't run around trying to look for it. It basically comes to us. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Got it. Got it. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. I missed it earlier. I think you mentioned that you did receive business interruption income in the third quarter and you put it in the other income, but I didn't catch-up figure. Did you provide one? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, no, we didn't, but it's the vast majority of the other income number. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Got it. Okay. And capital allocation, I guess a follow up to an earlier question. You guys did not buy back any stock after being active. It looks like second quarter stock is pretty much at the same level. Anything precluding you there from buying back stock or just maybe storing up dry powder for incremental read there. (01:14:17) Just curious on your thoughts on capital allocation regarding stock buybacks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I just think we're conservative. I would tell you that I want to hug Brian and Andy every day. Maybe I should get a little credit too. I just love our balance sheet where it is. I just love it, love it, love it. I just think it's so cool to have a balance sheet like that. So, we're going to be really conservative, thoughtful. And then, as you mentioned, I mean, obviously, we've got a very active redevelopment pipeline, but I just love, love, love our balance sheet. And I just think that's something that it's got to be unique, it's got to be unique set of circumstances to really do anything material to it. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay. Last one, I guess, same-store expense growth in the third quarter, can you provide what that was? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I don't know. I mean I have no idea, but Tom will follow you offline (01:15:34). We don't really do that. It's just our NOI or comp NOI. It is what it is. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : All right. I'll follow up with Tom. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Just to clarify something you guys mentioned earlier. The definition for leasing spreads and the volume, I think the pool (01:16:05) changed and now you're including anchor boxes. If that's correct, do you have any of those stats under the previous language available just for the sake of comparability? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's not just anchors, it's everything. It's whatever boxes come in and come out, (01:16:26) whatever theaters we renew, whatever amendments we take. And we just \u2013 we sat back and said, look, this is our business and it's important to focus on that because I think the market wants to know, great, you're getting these boxes back, but is there value in that real estate? Why are you paying for it, if there is not value on the re-leasing of that? And that's what we're trying to express. So we had \u2013 I will say this, if you look at the earlier definition, we had positive spreads that we think the market would be fine with. But I think the more important thing is to focus on what the future of our opportunity set is. And that's what we're trying to do. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: All right. And if I think about Simon and the size and the scale you guys have well above your peers, it's still interesting that on simon.com, you can't buy anything. Have you guys thought about that? Are there any initiatives underway? I could imagine, having something like that could probably help a lot of your data collection initiatives. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Have you been studying what we're up to? A very good question and an appropriate question. And the best answer, I have a really thoughtful answer and that is to stay tuned. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Sounds good. All right. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good morning. Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: How is the mixed-use redevelopment at Phipps Plaza reshaping your vision of the portfolios' potentiality? And in your thinking, how many additional large-scale repositionings exist within the Malls' portfolio? And what's your appetite for accelerating these investments? Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's interesting. We've been active now for over an hour and the word's KOP (01:18:38) and King of Prussia haven't come up yet. Our portfolio has a number of those activities. We emphasized before when we get back one of these department store boxes, it's more than just 150,000 to 200,000 feet. It's anywhere from 10 to 18 acres adjacent to some of the best real state in the United States. We are very focused on what we can do with those 18 acres. And you are going to see an accelerating amount of activity in a number of our properties where we have back 22 boxes. David said, we'd like to get back others. We've taken back Penneys (01:19:24). We've taken back Belks. So, you're going to keep seeing that. We have the capital, we have the expertise, we have the opportunity and it's going to be accelerating throughout the portfolio. Frankly, we've been doing this for a decade. The difference is we now have access to these 10 acres to 18 acres adjacent to our properties that can accelerate all of these activities and there are more top of mind for the investment community. So, it's a great opportunity. We're well positioned to doing it and it is, in fact, happening as we sit here talking to you. Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you. And just a last one, if you could share any updates on digitally native or e-tailer initiatives? I know you have some experience there now and have been doing it for a while. Any early customer or maybe brand retailer feedback that you think is worth sharing? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I would simply say that the store experience \u2013 the best way I can \u2013 we verbal on (01:20:38) a little bit, so let me be really concise. The best way I can say that is the store experience and the store requirement is back, and that is shouldn't be underappreciated. They all want stores. Period, end of story. Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And they are opening stores. We have a very active program right now where we've got probably 25 retailers that started on the internet that have opened stores with us and are opening more, because as David said, they work and they make money. Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is now open. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. In terms of the business interruption insurance and other income from Puerto Rico this quarter, do you expect anything material in 4Q as well? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. We expect to have some more because it comes in over a period of time, but again, all of that was planned in our guidance at the beginning of the year. Remember, we had Puerto Rico down. So, we've been reporting our numbers with basically on average around $35 million of EBITDA, adios, okay, between those two assets. So now, we're starting to play catch-up and happened a year ago. So that's been out of our numbers fourth quarter of last year, all the way up now and we're starting to come back a little bit as we collect the cash. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Would that continue into 2019 as well? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, at that point, the property will be back online, so then we'll have it. Then, we'll report it \u2013 just start normal NOI that we would get from that property. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, I understand that Sears going away is a long-term positive for you and the rest of the industry. As this is playing out though, short term, medium term, do you see store closures or liquidation sales is having a dampening effect on retailers for the holiday season and then, to the extent that the liquidations continue post-holiday? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, let me restate what I said about Sears. I am disappointed. We didn't want Sears to basically file Chapter 11 or go out of business. But given that it's \u2013 at least the Chapter 11 process is happening and given the fact that we could buy some of the real estate back, we're going to make the best of it. And at the end of the day, that could be a positive for us and in terms of diversifying the mix of our properties and so on and all the stuff that we already talked about. There is always a little bit of disruption when you have a liquidation. Just so you know, when you liquidate a store, you've got to follow a lot of rules. We will certainly enforce our legal rights there and hopefully, it will not be disruptive to the other patrons of our shopping environments and/or have any impact on our retailers. But there is a process there that they've got to run by and we intend to make sure they operate accordingly. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And then finally, you said you just completed a tour of Europe and I'm sure you visit regularly, but are there any novel retail models or concepts you felt inspired by or (01:24:30) U.S.? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, listen, a lot of the \u2013 there are a lot of great retailers in Europe, Spain, obviously, Sweden, Italy, France. And so I think what you don't see a lot of is kind of the Internet folks. I mean we're seeing most of that here, but beyond that in terms of Internet \u2013 entertainment, restaurants and obviously fashion and apparel, they're fantastic and they're very good people. And we do a lot of good stuff with them throughout the world, Asia, Europe and the U.S. So it's important for us. And I think that one of the benefits we've gotten over the years is that we're now \u2013 they recognize who we are and what we do, which may not have been the case a decade ago. Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing any further - David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. Go ahead, ma'am. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to David Simon for any further remarks. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: All right. Thank you. We appreciate your questions and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

David Simon : Good morning. We are pleased to report another year of record results, which marks our 25th year as a public company. Our full 2018 FFO per diluted share to be $12.13 an increase of 8.2% year-over-year, which will be at the high-end of our peer group and we beat the top end of our initial 2018 guidance by an impressive $0.11. Over the last four years, we've grown our FFO per share on a compound annual basis of 8%. And to provide perspective on our FFO generation, we produced approximately $165 million in our first full year as a public company, $165 million. And in 2018, we produced $4.3 billion. Through the commitment to our strategy, active portfolio management, disciplined investment, relentless focus on operations and cost structure, we have increased our annual FFO generation by more than 25 times since our IPO. For the fourth quarter, FFO was $1.15 billion or $3.23 per share, an increase of 3.5% year-over-year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio increased 3.7%, more than $230 million for the year. Our top NOI increased 2.3% for the year and 2.1% for the fourth quarter. Leasing activity remains solid. Average base rent was $54.18. The malls and the Premium Outlets recorded leasing spreads of $7.75 per square foot, an increase of 14.3%. We are pleased that retail sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Reported retail sales per square foot for the mall and outlet was a record $661 compared to $628 in the prior year period, an increase of 5.3%. Retail sales were strong across the portfolio, with growth in consecutive months throughout the year. And each platform ended the year at record retail sale levels. Our mall and premium outlet occupancy ended the quarter at 95.9%, an increase of 40 basis points from the third quarter, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the year prior. And leasing activity accelerated throughout the year, with occupancy for the combined malls and Premium Outlets increasing 130 basis points from the end of the first quarter through the year-end. We opened two new outlets in 2018 : the Premium Outlet Collection in Edmonton, Canada; Denver Premium Outlets. Construction continues on three new outlets in leading international markets, two of which will open this year : Queretaro, Mexico will open in the summer, and Malaga, Spain will open in the fall. We're also under construction on a new outlet in Cannock, United Kingdom, which will open in the spring of 2020. We expect to break ground on a new outlet in Bangkok, Thailand in the next few weeks. And our new development and projects and extensive pipeline of development opportunities across all of our platforms reinforce our industry-leading position. Important to know, our diversified income generation by geography and product type, with 48% of our NOI from domestic malls, 42% from our value platform, which is the Premium Outlets and mills; and 10% internationally, distinguishes Simon from all other retail real estate companies that are trading publicly. We completed a number of redevelopment expansion opportunities across our portfolio during 2018. Again, the expansions include Aventura; Toronto Premium Outlets; Shisui, Japan; Johor Premium in Singapore, where reclaiming department store spaces continue to be a focus and significant opportunity for the company. We currently have 10 anchor redevelopment projects under construction, with a gross cost of approximately $725 million. And we have an additional 25 opportunities we're actively working on that are in various stages of development. We continue to fund these redevelopment projects through our internally generated cash flow. Quickly turning to the balance sheet. Continues to lead our industry. Our liquidity ended the year at $7.5 billion. We have the strongest credit profile metrics in the REIT industry. Net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1 times, lowest in our sector. Our interest coverage ratio was 5.1. Our long-term issue rating of A/A2 continues to be the highest in the REIT sector. Our balance sheet continues to be a distinct advantage that should not be overlooked. During the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 287,000 shares of common, for approximately $47 million. We also redeemed 405,000 limited partnership units for $74 million. Going to the dividend. We paid a record dividend in 2018 of $7.90 per share. We have achieved the compound annual dividend growth rate of more than 11% over the last four years. We have paid more than $28 billion in dividends over our 25-year history as a public company. Today, we announced the dividend of $2.05 per share for this quarter, a year-over-year increase of 5.1%. At this current rate, we will have paid more than $100 in dividends per share by the second quarter this year. Before I turn to our outlook for 2019, let me summarize our 2018 results. We posted another year of industry-leading, record results, including revenues, cash flows, FFO per share and dividends. Our reported FFO diluted share \u2013 per share for 2018 was $12.13, which beat the midpoint of our initial guidance for the year by $0.17. Moving on to 2019. Our FFO guidance is $12.30 to $12.40 per share. When analyzing our 2019 range in context of our 2018 results, it is important to note the following. We expect the impact from FASB\u2019s ASU 2016-02 the new lease accounting standard to reduce FFO per share by approximately $0.13. There were some items included in our 2018 FFO per share. They are not expected to recur in 2019, including our gain of $0.10 per share related to the contribution of our investment in the Aeropostale licensing business for an increased ownership interest in ABG. Higher income related to distributions from an international investments of approximately $0.05 per share. These non-recurring items are approximately $0.15 per share in FFO for 2018 when you then adjust 18 for those factors you get to $11.85 with our new guidance for 2019, we will have approximately 4% to 4.5% growth compared to this adjusted number for 2018. We expect our 2000 growth rate will be at the high end of our peer group. Also keep in mind when we are looking at our 2019 number, we are expecting lower lease settlement income in 2019 compared to the prior year. We will have lost rents in 2019 due to closed department store spaces and the downtime related to redevelopment of those spaces. This impact to our NOI this year is temporary, as these investments will yield healthy returns and accelerate our NOI growth in 2020 and 2021. We expect the impact of rising interest rates and a stronger dollar to affect our results for 2019 compared to 2018 and we also had the loss of our share of the FFO from the German operations of our HBS joint venture, which was sold at the end of 2018 for a gain of $91 million. So, therefore lot there, hope you are fast studied like I am. Additional assumptions supporting our 2019 outlook include the following. Comparable NOI growth for combined Mall and Premium Outlets and Mills platform of 2%. No planned acquisition activity or retail disposition activity, assuming no launch of our consumer-oriented platform and a diluted share count of approximately 356 million shares. To conclude, we had another excellent year, capping a solid first quarter century as a public company. We have consistently posted industry-leading returns along the way through hard work, innovation, great people, and great assets as in any industry is more important than ever that we drive change, focus on delivering, exceptional experience for our tenants and consumers, and we are now ready for questions. Thank you for listening. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. First just wanted to congratulate Rick given the changes that are going to come later in 2019. RickSokolov: Thank you. Craig Schmidt : My questions, I guess, you touched on it in your opening comments, but maybe you could talk about some of the other possible impacts from the repurposing of the Sears anchors you know like sales disruption or any kind of competition you might have to give tenants while you're working on the Sears space and especially with the densification efforts? David Simon : Well, you know, Craig again, I think, I'd implore you and other people that covers just, you got to look at it differently. We are in \u2013 some of the numbers that I gave you need to be factored in. So, we started, our enterprise in a $165 million of funds from operation. Today, we have 4.3 billion. We have 48% of our business in the Mall business and when we started it was 90% through 95%. So, there's always disruption in our industry, department store spaces that we reclaim either through lease termination or acquisition, we think will be beneficial in the long run. There are down-times associated with that and like I said, well \u2013 that's all kind of manageable for a company like ours, and we give you the best sense of our guidance, and it is kind of all factored in there within this range that we hope to produce. We have obviously a history unrivaled frankly, I think, about beating expectations. We'll see this year. We've got a lot going on. So I don't \u2013 we're not going to zeroing about one particular property, one particular tenant, one particular issue because you got to look at us on a broader basis. We're a little bit different. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thanks. And then I just wondered, if you've been having any discussions with JCPenney about potential store closings? DavidSimon: No. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Bilerman : Yeah, good morning. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. So, David \u2026 David Simon : From the hip I'm like happy, but I don't know, Rick. I think Rick is squarer down here. What do you think? Michael Bilerman : I just hope that Rick is still going to be on these calls to go through the laundry list of retailers that are coming into your malls. So, David, you are pretty quick to deny the speculation of Simon trying to buy Macerich, which I can understand, if you are buying them. But, I guess, if I step back, why wouldn't you buy them because every deal that you've done in the past 25 years has worked out pretty well for shareholders. Great cost of capital. You talked about your under leveraged balance sheet being a distinct advantage that shouldn't be overlooked. You have an unbelievable platform that can produce synergies, you've proven out your redevelopment and densification efforts. You can probably access as much third-party capital as you wanted. You've consistently raised your cash flow and your earnings, which has led to dividend growth, which is pretty much contrary to every one of your peers by the way. So with those set of facts and the performance, why wouldn't you be more aggressive on the acquisition front? David Simon : Well, first of all, Michael thank you for recognizing some of our achievements. Over the last 25 years I mean we do \u2013 we try to explain the company maybe we're not very good at it, to our best of our abilities we're a little bit different because of some of those factors. But obviously, Michael, I'm not going to comment on any specific company. We tried to do a deal with Macerich long time ago that's, as I've said before yesterday's news. We're glad to partner with them in Carson, which is moving forward and but I'm not going to comment on any deal we may or may not do or any particular company. We have no plans currently to do kind of M&A activity and we're very focused on what we've got in front of us. We're excited about the continuation of the evolution of the mall industry the way it's been evolving for 60 plus years. We are excited about our outlet business in the international, breadth and depth that it has. And as I mentioned in my calls you know we had leading sales per square foot in every platform. So we've got plenty to do and we have no plans at all to think about anything and we're focused on executing the vast amount of activity that we have. Christy McElroy : Hi David, it's Christy. Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Christy McElroy : You're coming off of a year of positive sales growth from a tenant perspective. You've been able to gain occupancy and maintain pricing power. Just from where you sit today and what you're seeing in terms of the health and store performance among your shop tenants. Would you expect that 2019 would be a little bit of a tougher year from a tenant sellout and leasing perspective? And then just sort of related to that, as you've been building your fifth platform and announcing more consumer-focused initiatives, maybe you can talk about what you see coming down the pipe in 2019? David Simon : Well, maybe I'll just start and Rick can chime in. Look, I do think on the retail front, the strong are getting stronger. It's \u2013 as you've seen by numbers throughout the retail community, the days of a rising economic boat don't lift \u2013 or tide don't lift all retail boats. And you've had a lot of over \u2013 outperformance and a lot of underperformance. The underperformance, I can talk off-line on a theory of why that is, but I don't want to bore you. And there are some retailers out there that were nervous about. I mean, so far in the first quarter, bankruptcies are trending lower than they were in 2017 and 2018. However, there's some rumored names out there that could ultimately end up being a similar 2017 and 2018. 2018, as we said and as we look and anticipated 2018, we thought it would be less than 2017. We were ended up being right there. But I do think there will be more bankruptcies to come in 2019. And that's why we're relatively conservative as we look at our comp NOI. Because, look, it takes time to \u2013 it's a little bit out of our control when we get the space, and then to do a lease takes time. And even though as much as we anticipate it, we \u2013 would just take time to lease the space. So I mean, we have our work cut out. We are concerned about a few retailers. That should shake out in Q1. But I think the retailers that are investing in their product, in their store experience, in their branding were having decent results. So physical retail can produce good results, but it can't be distracted with a lot of other activities. And obviously, as you know, we've had a number of retailers. The list is long, the landscape is littered of leveraged buyouts in our industry that we continue to sort through. So that, I hope, answered the first question. On the second one, look, we're very close to launching this platform. And if these things always \u2013 it's a little bit like building something, but it's not quite as certain, it's more like to building internationally, where you think you're going to open in Q3, it goes to Q4, then goes to Q1. We've had a couple of those in maybe Spain and Mexico, where it happens, delay a quarter there. So it \u2013 I would expect us to launch. It will affect, I mean, again, I mean, we're going to \u2013 you see our numbers, it will be \u2013 the earnings impact to it will be, I think, completely on the margin. I hope the market appreciates that. But because we don't have a set date yet on when that might happen, we're not going to put it in our numbers. And then if we launch it, we'll show it to you. We will say, oh, boy, that's worth a shot. It's not a big deal. It's a couple of cents here and there. And it's an unbelievable investment in our future, and we'll see where it goes. So we expect that to happen, but a little bit \u2013 we just don't know exactly when we'll launch, so we've been hesitant to say, it's a Q1 or Q2 or Q3 debut. So again, in summary, with the retailers are focused on product, brand, service, they're doing better, that they're leveraged. We have an investment in their business, overinvested in e-commerce, struggling. Leveraged buyouts were not ultimately beneficial, by and large, to our business. That's kind of working its way out of the system. And we are excited about our fifth platform. We expect it to debut, but when and how is a little bit up in the air, so we'll just keep it at that. We'll keep it off the table for now. But when we do, we'll share it with you. Again, I think we're pretty transparent. I mean, the reason \u2013 I guess, when you take a step back and think about our company, we're not \u2013 we got all these assets. We got all these business. It's all international. It's outlets. So if we got as granular as you wanted, it would waste your time and waste our time. So again, just \u2013 you've got to kind of think of us a little bit differently that we're not these handful of assets here and there yet. And that's why we tried to give you a broader, bigger picture of what we're all about and what we expect during next year or this year. Christy McElroy : Great, thank you, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. David, I don't know, you or Rick, maybe just talk about some of the newer tenants and some of the more online tenants, kind of your experience and success bringing some of these folks into the mall. And sort of your outlook for their growth into 2019 and 2020? Rick Sokolov : Hi, it's Rick. Just to step back, in all of these discussions, the single-best thing we have going for us are incredibly strong properties across all three of our platforms. So in any dynamic any of you talk about, the key is do we have places where retailers want to be, and happily, we do, and they're getting better by the day as we invest our capital and enhance them. In terms of the retailers, e-retailers are certainly one aspect of it. And there, we're working with probably 40 different ones. We've rolled out Untuckit. You've heard out all the names, and they want to be not unlike any other retailer in the best properties. And so we are doing deals with Warby Parker, Fabletics, Indochino and Untuckit, and I could go on. And they are finding success. And you don't have to take our word for it. You can take what they're saying. A lot of them are expressly raising money to roll out more stores. So that has been an interesting and important part of diversifying our tenant mix and keeping our properties current. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then, David, I just wanted to circle back. You talked through about the anchor redevelopment. And you said you're actively working on another 25. Just in terms of sort of the mix between retail and hotels and office and multifamily, how are those sort of projects sort of breaking out in terms of the alternative uses? David Simon : Actually, I think we've never been busier on the alternative uses. We got a list in the 8-K that shows you what's been approved, but that doesn't \u2013 I think, essentially, that pales in comparison to the future activity. I'll just \u2013 three off the top of my head, Steve, that are massive mixed-use projects, include Northgate, which we have made a deal with the NHL franchise in Seattle, to do their corporate office as well as their practice facility and ice facilities for the general public. We have Brea, which we have a reclaimed department store space that is in the process of permitting to do a massive amount of residential. Same thing with Stonebridge in California, so those aren't even on our list. We, obviously, had a significant redevelopment. We're feeling the pressure what we're going through in our portfolio. So I would say by and large, when we're looking at these spaces, they're much more focused on changing the mix, adding additional elements. And then adding the wellness, fitness, restaurants, resi, hotels to kind of make it kind of a standard statement of live, work, play, et cetera. So rarely is it just small shops. And I would say, by and large, the vast majority has all those elements that I just mentioned. Do you, Rick, want to\u2026 Rick Sokolov : The one other thing I would say to you, to echo David's point, this trend is accelerating. This time last year in our K, we listed 11 projects for 2018 and beyond. This year, we have 19. And as David said, we have many more that are in the pipeline that are going to be coming in here. So we have a dedicated team. We have demand because our properties are located in great places. And that is going to be an accelerating portion of our development activity. Steve Sakwa : And maybe just to follow up. Just on the cost and kind of yield when you sort of look at these future projects, just given what we've seen in construction cost increases, how would you sort of, I guess, estimate the returns on the future projects versus the ones that are \u2013 either recently completed or currently underway? David Simon : Well, I mean, look, it's not redevelopment. I mean, it's not new development returns but I think our redevelopment efforts will be consistent in terms of return that we have over the last several years. I mean, it's certainly accretive to the value of the asset, otherwise, we wouldn't do it. And 6 to 10 is kind of the range, and a lot goes into that, Steve. But accretive to the value of the asset, otherwise, we're just not going to invest. I mean, the \u2013 we don't feel like we have to, because of the size and scope of the portfolio, we don't feel like we have to invest in an asset just to maintain it. That's not to say that we don't do appropriate maintenance investments, like a typical renovation and that kind of stuff. But we don't feel compelled to do it. We do it with the lens of what the consumer expects, what the retailer wants and what the value of that asset is in our minds. And that's when we pull the trigger. Our investment returns \u2013 and we haven't batted 1,000, as my favorite \u2013 I don't want to attribute because you may get mad at me. But I think our returns on investment have not been too shabby over our career. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it from me. David Simon : Sure. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning out there. David Simon : Good morning, out there is right, it\u2019s \u2013 I want people to know it\u2019s cold and snowing. But we are here. Alexander Goldfarb : Well, at least the malls are heated. So they have somewhere to warm up. David Simon : You bet. Alexander Goldfarb : So Rick, congratulations and David, I think you said $25 billion in dividends over the time, which is pretty remarkable. David Simon : Alex, you've never been great at math, not as good as we are, but its $28 billion, $28 billion. Alexander Goldfarb : $28 billion. Okay. So, I was a little off. David Simon : I'm just kidding, it was a joke. Okay, just \u2013 you are very good at math actually. Alexander Goldfarb : Your time. Just following up on Christy's question on the consumer platform that you're talking about, I mean, you're \u2013 is this something like Simon brand ventures that will interplay with \u2013 throughout the company or this truly is something totally separate and apart from your existing malls, mills, outlets et cetera. David Simon : Well, it is, put it this way, we would not be doing what we're doing, if we didn't own the assets that we own then had the branding that we do and had the consumer touch point as well as the retailer touch points. So, it is absolutely unequivocally related, and we hope it will be synergistic between what we do today, and what we want to do in the future. So, we would not be doing it, if we didn't have the business that we're currently obviously involved in day to day. So, it is complementary and where it goes will be a function of our commitment to invest, our courage to invest, conviction and our ability to execute what we think might be a real interest. Alexander Goldfarb : But this is something that would add like where SBV adds NOI or adds income to the overall company. This would be something commensurate, correct? David Simon : Well, there will be an investment period, but the reality is, yes, we think it will have a financial return associated with it, but it is a little bit, there isn't a serious investment period before we get to that point. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the next question is on retailers, you said, you're expecting more shake out. Clearly minimum wage increases and just strong economy, low unemployment is pressuring on the wage front. Across your tenants, are you seeing all of them absorbing the higher wage or are the rising incomes allowing them to offset by raising their prices because their consumers are having more income. Just sort of curious how the wage and operating expense dynamic is occurring with your retailers, and if you think that's going to be a growing pressure point among your tenants? David Simon : Well, I do think the category that seems to be most sensitive to that today is clearly in the restaurant category. So, I do think those pressures are affecting decision-making. Now we haven't and I think that \u2013 it's interesting because they're very \u2013 those folks are very sensitive to location and to the extent that states have enacted minimum wage laws were higher than federal mandated numbers. It's got to be a really unique opportunity for the restaurant toward to do it, and thankfully we have most of those, but is it affecting the marginal deal in some of those states. I would have to say, yes, I don't necessarily see it on the, what I'd call, the soft goods apparel side. I haven't seen it in the wellness other side, but I think it's something to pay attention to and where we see it initially is in certain states and primarily when it comes to restaurants. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning. David Simon : Good Morning. Caitlin Burrows : I was just wondering, if you could go through the decision to do buybacks during the quarter and then generally how that compares to your other uses of capital? David Simon : Well, on the units, it was just \u2013 we have the right. So, by and large we believe in the growth of our business units. We have the ability when they want to convert to buy the cash. So, it's a pretty easy simple trade and we'll continue to do that as that happens. And there was a period of time in December, obviously, where the world was changing, I mean, obviously equities were being whipsawed around and we took advantage slightly, but we took advantage of that whipsawing. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then on the balance sheet side also which obviously is a great differentiator for Simon. You previously had $600 million that was actually maturing today. So, I guess, I was just wondering what were the sources there and especially considering the development spend this year. Do you plan to issue new unsecured debt? Brian McDade : Hi, Caitlin. This is Brian. You're absolutely right. We had $600 million maturity today. As David mentioned in his remarks, we ended the year with 7.5 billion of liquidity. So we use existing liquidity to retire those notes this morning. David Simon : Good news is we paid it off. Caitlin Burrows : Great. David Simon : That's not always the case in the real estate industry, okay, that we pay it off. Caitlin Burrows Caitlin Burrows : And then maybe one more if I could. Could you discuss maybe market rent trends? And where they're stronger versus less so, for example, by U.S. quality or outlet versus mills or open air versus enclosed? Rick Sokolov : It's Rick. Frankly, we are having pricing power across our portfolios. And again, that is the function of quality of the properties. It all starts there. And as we continue to improve them, we're able to drive our rents. And I think your \u2013 that's demonstrated in the spreads that we've reported. David Simon : Look, I would only add to that. Look, the reality of how leasing works is that it does take time to lease space, right? It's not like we make a deal, we negotiate the lease, the retailer builds the store, blah-blah-blah. So with \u2013 and if you look the NOI growth, I mean, it's only \u2013 the comp NOI growth, it's only \u2013 it's being affected by some of these retailers that are going through this significant change. And we tend to work with them because at the end of the day, we tend to do it on a shorter-term basis. Because we know, ultimately, we have to re-lease the space to someone. So there is a little bit of supply and demand that we are working our way through, and that's \u2013 I think it's been manifesting itself in the numbers over the last year or so. We expect it to manifest itself in 2019 as well. But when it comes to a good property and a good space with a good retailer, we're making strides. But we're working with some of the ones that are going through their various restructurings, and that ultimately has some impact, certainly, in the short run. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Jeremy Metz : You guys \u2013 good morning. You mentioned the 10 anchor positions you have underway, the additional 25 you're working on. Just given some of the other development and the redevelopment opportunities you obviously have on your plate as well, are you comfortable taking leverage up some from here as you kick off more of these projects? And is there anything kind of holding you back on starting more of these other than just getting those right plans in place? Basically, would you be comfortable taking the pipeline up another billion when they're ready to go? David Simon : Well, look, unfortunately, in a lot of these areas that I mentioned earlier when Steve asked the question, there is real process about permitting. I mean, we could show you our permitting file, and you wonder whether it's \u2013 I'll refrain. But it is a process where you scratch your head sometimes, because all you're doing is making the asset better for the community and for everybody that lives there. But municipalities are, in a lot of areas, are \u2013 you got to go through a real process. We see it all the time. And we still see it in Long Island, as an example, on our project that we have to land and sign off it. I mean, we see it everywhere to go through. It's just a process. I would say to you, Jeremy, that holds us back more than anything, because if I had approvals in, like Brea, we would start and the King of Prussia, we will start. If we had approvals in Oyster Bay, we would start, but we don't. Stoneridge we would start. That to us is governor more than the balance sheet, though, I will say we respect our balance sheet, and we are very focused on it. I'd also say that \u2013 but I'd say the permitting is the biggest constraint. The second is, I mean, human resource constraint is not to be underappreciated, because everybody here is really hustling, very active. And pressure is intense here. And that comes as no surprise to most. I mean, that's more of a constraint as opposed to, boy, we can't make this investment, because we're too levered or we're worried about our cash flow generation or our maturities that are coming up. I mean, we don't do that. But I say that with all due respect, because the fact of the matter is if we didn't take that into account, we wouldn't be in the spot that we are in today. So we do take it into account. We just it by \u2013 it's just ingrained in the culture that we do it by osmosis. Jeremy Metz : That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate that color. And then you did mention in your outlook for 2019 your expectations for comp NOI of 2%. You've been more focused on portfolio NOI growth though in most of your commentary, so I know that's what matters more to you. So any color on where the expectations are for that to trend? David Simon : We didn't \u2013 I don't think we're giving guidance there. We don't have a big portfolio NOI because a lot of the new developments that generate that are acquisitions we're not planning on. And we had some delays in a couple of our international deals that I mentioned earlier. We have a reduction in that, because the German sale of HBS. So it's not going to be \u2013 it won't be the growth that we had, obviously, in 2018 were we had a more external activity. So part of \u2013 it will add incrementally, but it's not going to be like the spread between what we had in 2018, primarily because our developments, as I mentioned to you, have been delayed, and our new developments have been delayed. And again, we sold our HBS German business. Jeremy Metz : Got it. That make sense. And last one for me. You've had some really solid sales results here, obviously, in the past few quarters. Your lease spreads have been solidly in that double-digit range. I assume you're still obviously pushing your standard kind of 3% rent escalators through. So I guess I'm just wondering if some of that have been translated into higher ADR growth necessarily. Is there anything we are missing there? Or should the ADR growth really start to follow suit here? David Simon : Well, look, I think that the pressure \u2013 I mentioned it earlier. I mean, the pressure that we have is that we are still dealing with a handful of retailers that, for whatever reason, have to go through their various restructurings. Because we can't lease every space, every minute, we tend to work with them, and that does put pressure on our ADR. But it's moving in the right direction. I do think the cycle of the levered retailers is working its way through the system. And I think, Jeremy, at the end of the day, we to just like cleanse, I mean, we\u2019re suffering the pain. I mean, 2% comp NOI is not \u2013 we're not ecstatic about it, but the primary factor in that is the retailers that are going through the various restructurings that we had. So I think, though, as that's cleansed, we'll get to that number. But retailers are very focused on their cost and their operating model. Stores continue to be their best investment and their best return. Obviously, there's a lot to talk about how profitable the Internet is and e-commerce and who's bearing the brunt of the investment and all that. I don't want to get into the psycho babble talk about that, but the reality is, because of a lot of investments they're making, they're looking at every expense category. And they're \u2013 we are having those discussions. They're not easy. Jeremy Metz : Thanks for the time, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Haendel St. Juste: So David, as have been discussed, you have one of the best balance sheet, platforms, track records in the REIT sector. And yet you trade an implied cap rate about mid 5, which seems to be in line with the overall REIT sector. So curious why you think that's the case. If it's fair, and what levers to you consider pulling to address that? David Simon : Well, I'm not worried. Look, I think you \u2013 I think what we focus on is trying to make our product better as opposed to what levers we can pull to where we think we ought to trade at a better number than the next guy. I mean, if I took that philosophy, we'd be more levered. We'd be this. We'd be that. I don't look at it like that. I look at it, how do we make this company better day in and day out? So that's the focus. Why do I personally think that? I have no idea. You guys know better than I do. I always think, why aren't we, given our cash flow generation and our ability to make appropriate, strategic investments and our ability to withstand the restructuring that's been going on in the retail industry better than most, I don't know. If I had to tell you one thing, it's probably because people think we're going to buy something. And then when we tell people we not, they ask, why aren't you going to buy something? So I don't know. I don't sit here and obsess over it. We are focused on making this product better. People that get obsessed with where their stock price is, I think, end up making blunders. That's not a REIT statement. That's a corporate America statement. And that's the philosophy. I hope shareholders appreciate it. Maybe they don't, but that's how we operate the business. That's how, I think, our board thinks about it. How do we make our products better and our business better? When we do that, it tends to manifest itself in the earnings, and then we go from there. But I don't know. I mean, if I didn't answer your question, but I'm happy to hear what you \u2013 do you have any ideas, you tell me. Haendel St. Juste: Well, look, I think, perhaps the sector is one variable to consider. It is a tougher business these days, but I think what you guys have built certainly merits value and should be acknowledged though. I'll just leave it there. My second question is on the rising cost of Labor, which has been well documented. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the labor cost inflation built into your 2019 guide, maybe from a R&M and corporate G&A perspective. The corporate G&A has been trending down the past couple of years. I'm curious if you think that could continue as well. David Simon : I think we're budgeting pretty consistent numbers for our G&A next year. We don't see any major changes in that. I mean, I think we \u2013 the area that we're going to end up beefing up is in the area of mixed-use development. So we're going to be adding some bodies over time. But again it's \u2013 that's the other nice thing about the company. We still have the lowest overhead ratio by a large margin. I don't \u2013 I can't remember the numbers. It's 2, 2.5, right, to 10, 10 and 11 to other companies, basically your G&A to NOI roughly, right. So I mean, it's a staggering difference, okay. It's not like 100 basis points. It's like 700, 800 basis points. So I mean, that's not going to be anything out of the ordinary for us. But we are going to add some people in certain areas that we need to, to execute our vision on some of these redevelopments. Haendel St. Juste: And last one, was there any reason that you can perhaps share with us on the sale of the German outlet, I think the designer outlet, Ochtrup. David Simon : I'm not \u2013 I'm sorry, I don't \u2013 I don't think that's accurate. What was your question again? Haendel St. Juste: I was just curious on the rationale for the sale of the German thing you're selling, the outlet. David Simon : We did not sell the outlet. Actually, Ochtrup, we actually bought a few years ago. What we sold was our \u2013 we're partners with Hudson Bay, among others, in addition to other institutional investors. We had the Kaufhof real estate investment that, because of the merger with Kaufhof and Karstadt, they wanted to also own the real estate. So they bought out the real estate interest in the department stores that Karstadt leased. And that's what triggered our $91 million gain. But it's not \u2013 we didn't sell an outlet. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. David Simon : Yes, of course. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai : Hi, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Linda Tsai : In 2018, you guided SS NOI to above 2% and came in at 2.3%. And now you're looking for 2% growth in 2019, implying slight deceleration, but understanding that this also reflects what's happening with more closures and the Sears redevelopment. Do you view 2% as a trough? Or is this sort of a steady-state, long-term growth rate for high-quality outlets and mall? David Simon : Well, we do not think it's our steady state, but we are \u2013 because of the redevelopment, we are \u2013 there is a significant amount of reduction in 2019 due to income that we received from certain department stores. And then it takes a year or two to build, and we're going to \u2013 we're suffering from that in 2019. So that's certainly part of it. And then the other part is, just what I mentioned earlier, just dealing with some of the retailers that have been continuing to go through a more difficult time. But no, we don't \u2013 I don't view 2%. No, 2% makes me \u2013 I mean, we try to give you a sense of where we're at, we hope to do better, but I do not under any circumstance think 2% is our steady-state. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then through your Simon Ventures Fund when you look at some of these nascent brands you're nurturing for this platform. What are some of the business models or concepts you're seeing that make them more successful versus what's happening with some of the struggling legacy retailers. Are these concepts more niche like in nature or could be grown, scaled and replicated across larger physical base? David Simon : Well, I don't think you can go from that point to the next point, I mean, I think the retailers that have struggled by and large have had and again we have a list that, and I don't know, if I should, well, put it this way. We have a long list of retailers that have struggled, 80% to 90% of that list have been over levered, so they couldn't turn left or right. And you just can't have too much leverage in any industry and any business when things are \u2013 you run into an economic difficulty or you need to make investments, you just got \u2013 you have nowhere to go, and if I read you the list, you would, it might \u2013 it comforts me in one sense because we would stood this pretty successfully. On the other hand, I might scare you. So, I prefer not to scare you at this point, okay. But it's something that we've been able to withstand. And so, I think, that whole \u2013 that's where and the retailers have a vision and whether they're starting from the internet or just been around, but they've invested in their business and their product. We're seeing pretty good results. Let's look at the higher end luxury category, they don't have a lot of internet sales, they invest unbelievably in the store experience and then the product and whoops guess what they had great results. So, not overly complicated, the technology and some of the new concepts that we've seen out there that have been successful, usually it's a visionary leader. It's a visionary group that's dedicated to the business. They may have a little bit different angle on something that exist today. And they just execute it better than the next person. I mean, as an example, we're an investor in FabFitFun, which just raised $80 million from Kleiner Perkins and that's and that's basically a subscription business, which has been done before, but they just know how to do it better and more creatively and with better focus than maybe the next person. And that's always been the case in industries, right. There's somebody \u2013 there may be another idea, but the group takes that idea and then just does it a little better than the next person. So \u2013 I think the power of our industry is that we can withstand the ups and downs of a retailer \u2013 or retailers. There are points in time where it's painful as we go through that with them. But ultimately, whether they turn it around or not, if we get the space back, historically, we've been able to lease it to a better person. So that's what we've done. Now will give you a number that I probably shouldn't, but we tend to be on most retailers' unsecured creditors committees. We have somebody internally that's \u2013 he's been around as long as me, Rick, so he's \u2013 been through his time. He has \u2013 and this is \u2013 I think this is actually a great, positive statement about our industry and our business. But he is currently on his 200th, 200th unsecured creditors committee. Now okay, yes, that might say \u2013 holy cow, that makes you a little nervous. On the other hand, I mean, we did earn $4.3 billion. And my colleagues that's been on this committee, leasing committee, is on his 200th. So I think more importantly, it speaks to the resilience of our industry, our product and what the consumer really wants. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Thanks. Just have a quick one. For the 2019 outlook, are there any significant onetime, either expenses or benefits, that we should be aware of? I guess, for example, like the Puerto Rico insurance recovery, anything like that? David Simon : Well, actually. Puerto Rico came in lower than we thought in 2018. So as a company of this size, we're always going to have some of that stuff. We don't really get into that level of detail. I mentioned some of the other items that we think will be lower this year, like resettlement income. We do think rates rising will have some impact negatively as well as the stronger dollar. Now some of that stuff is moving around. I mean, who knows how it all shakes out. So we'll \u2013 we are always going to have \u2013 I think that's another interesting thing about this company, is that we're able to create other income opportunities. We have some, but We don't really get into that level of detail. It's all kind of factored into our numbers. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then last thing, the sales of $661, Do you have that number on a weighted \u2013 NOI-weighted basis? David Simon : We do, and the number is $832. So we took \u2013 I asked, Tom, do people care about that NOI-rated number? And he said no, no one's ever called me or asked me, so we took it out. But the number is $832 a foot. Michael Mueller : Yes, it just seems like if you're doing in any of the buildup, you should apply a weighted average cap rate. David Simon : Yes, we don't disagree. If people really like it, we are happy to put it back in, and they can call Tom. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Good morning. Just a question on your tenant reimbursements. You had an unusual situation last year where the reimbursements declined about 1% for the year. Same impact in the fourth quarter. So what's driving that? David Simon : That's usually just the quarterly spread of how things go. Nothing's driving it. I mean, again, you need to look at the totality of the year and not quarter-by-quarter. Nick Yulico : Yes, that's what I'm saying. If you look the year, your reimbursements declined 1%, and so that's what I'm trying to figure out. What was usual? I mean, your occupancy is going up. Your expenses are going up. How come your tenant reimbursements are going down? David Simon : Those are the numbers. Nick Yulico : I mean, is that something, David, when you're talking about earlier when you're working with some retailers, is low reimbursements one of the tools you're offering to challenge retailers? David Simon : No. I think we had a significant rise in utility cost and other items. So we're not just \u2013 you had some disposals that factored in there. I don't think it's anything material. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Good morning all there. When you think about your \u2013 the capital you're allocating to redevelopment deal, newer development, what do you think about the risk profile of that newer deals you're doing, like the Sears repositioning or densification deals? Is the risk profile for those deals similar to what you've done in the past in terms of redevelopment? Or it's a little bit different? David Simon : I mean, that's what we do. I don't \u2013 there's no \u2013 I'd say the risk is \u2013 we don't feel like we are at \u2013 on the higher-risk plank than redeveloping a department store space than anything else. Rick Sokolov : We're applying the same discipline to decide whether were going to build a multifamily or an office or a hotel that we apply when we're doing a retail redevelopment. We do our market studies. We assess market rents, and we make sure that we're doing a good capital allocation decision as we decide to put in these incremental elements to our properties. So the risk is, frankly, the same because we're doing the same underwriting Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Just going back to the same store NOI. Can you provide a little bit more detail around what type of cushion that you're building in, and specifically, the temporary retailer that you're having to recover your position? How much of an impact is that making to that 2% same store NOI growth? David Simon : Look, we don't do that. I encourage you to think about our company a little bit differently, look at our history and realize that we're a very large company with a very \u2013 we don't get into that granular level of detail, and we would encourage you just to look at our history. And the fact that this is the number that we roll up, and we don't really get into that kind of detail. Ki Bin Kim : All right. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Wes Golladay : Hey, good morning everyone. You mentioned there's some tenants that may be a little less relevant these days, and some of them don't have balance sheet issues. Have you seen any changes in tenant retention at lease expiration? And how much of a headwind is this for same store NOI, due to the 10 basis point headwind each year, or 50 basis points. Any context around that would be great. Rick Sokolov : We have had pretty much the same percentage of renewals that we've had historically. So that has not been manifesting or seen itself as an issue. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then maybe for a given year, is it typically about a 20 basis point impact? Does that seem about right? Rick Sokolov : In what context? I mean, we're renewing about the same percentage of the tenants. We have tenants that we are intentionally not renewing, because we want to bring in more productive tenants that are better operators. And we have tenants, as David has referenced, that through own issues, have to be falling out. So that hasn't changed over all the years we've been operating. It's just the same constant dynamic. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thanks a lot. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is reopened. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. I just had two quick follow-ups. David, at the end of your opening comments, you talked about all the changes 2018 relative to 2019, you rattled off the FASB change, the Aero gain, the loss of FFO, the sale of the German operations, lower Houston fees. The impact of rising rates and the rising dollar on your international operations, and then you talked about, and you mentioned it a couple of times was this impact of the lower department store NOI, as you take those boxes back and you redevelop them. Are you able to at least recognize your large company, we should think about you differently, but are you able just to identify the impact of that item you produced $5.7 billion of same-store NOI. I'm just trying to get a sense of how big that piece is, impact of that 2% growth rate? David Simon : Well, I guess, if material enough to mention it, okay. But again I \u2013 we are not \u2013 we don't get into this \u2013 the granularity of these debates. We ask that you look at our track record and our ability to generate cash flow, I mean, as we did say\u2026 Michael Bilerman : And I do that, right? David Simon : Again, so, I guess, and I answered it exactly how I would answer. In other words, we would mention it, if it was $12, okay, but we also wouldn't mention it, we would mention it, if it's material, but we don't \u2013 we're not going to, we don't give that number, it all goes into our buildup and, but we also don't want to make, I mean, and the purpose of not disclosing it is because we don't want to make excuses, a lot of companies say, next year is a throwaway year because I'm investing this that and the other, and we don't do that here. And that's \u2013 so the reality is, yes, we're going to have the best growth, I think, in the retail real estate industry. I don't know, if anybody is going to be better, but if there is maybe one or two, we're going to have the best dividend growth probably in the industry. We had the best balance sheet in the industry. And, yes, we've got some setbacks and you know what, we're not going to have a throwaway year, we're just going to keep doing what we do, and we don't want to use that as an excuse and that's the facts. Michael Bilerman : Listen, I always take when company say. Well, if you exclude this \u2013 and then as we produced 10% like well shareholders don't have that choice, shareholders will know the whole damn thing, right. I was just trying to focusing on you brought it up and I was just trying to figure out what sort of headwind it was creating on that 2% number? David Simon : It is, again, I'll answer it exactly how I should, which is the.. Michael Bilerman : You don't need to answer the same way. David Simon : Okay. Again I just think, we got \u2013 we all want to, let me micromanage, I will micromanage with my team, you guys look big picture, okay And when you look big picture, you're going to say, hey, we paid $28 billion in 25 years, that's not too shabby, and again tenant reimbursements, okay. Well, the real, look, let's talk about tenant reimbursements, real estate taxes go up because the municipalities want to attack the golden goose, they don't want to attack the internet sales, yes, they are like figuring it out. So, let's just see how it all evolves, we know what \u2013 we know how to \u2013 we know how to deal with the stuff, and we will continue to produce, I think, industry-leading results, if we don't do it in one year, call us where you want to call us. Michael Bilerman : And then just a clarification on this whole consumer initiative when you and I spoke about this a bunch after you put it out in your shareholders letter last year. You sort of said there is a few cents potentially as a cost. I'm just trying to understand, is that a cost to capital cost or let's say you go out and you put $500 million or it's $1 billion investment, the impact is the cost of carry before the initiative starts to produce results? David Simon : Again, it's \u2013 we pointed out because it's an investment. It's not going to be, let's assume, we earned $12.35. We're not going to be at $12 because of that, okay. We are not, I would appreciate, just the understanding that we're thoughtful folks but, yet, we do need to make investments for the future. And we have the track record that allows us to think about that a little bit that warrants our thoughtfulness. So, it's going to be a number and it's not going to be a big deal and we'll figure it out going forward. Michael Bilerman : And I have no qualms with the company making investments. There was just more or so I was trying to understand if that was \u2013 the cost was making the dollar investment, which is very small, right. A few pennies 10, 12, 13 million bucks or does that represent the cost of carry on a much larger investment is, thinking about it of, look, I'll out go and I'll put $500 million to something in the effective opportunity cost of that capital? David Simon : You are dealing with the guys who knows accounting. So, the reality is both, right because you have to depreciate the stuff, you don't add it back for FFO, sums investments, sums and operating expenses. So, it's actually, it would be both, okay. It's not \u2013 you don't add the FFO back from \u2013 for depreciation because it's not real property. So, it's a little bit of both, the amortized certain cost, it's IT spend. So, sums and amortized, we can sit down and go through the P&L, if you're really interested. Michael Bilerman : It would be scintillating. David Simon : It will be scintillating. Michael Bilerman : Okay. I appreciate it, David. Thank you. Have a good rest of the year. David Simon : No worries. Operator : The next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Derek Johnston : Could you help us understand the retail leasing environment today versus six or 12 months ago. Any category standout from a lease term or store closure versus store opening perspective and has rising sales per square foot over the past year plus translated into higher demand for space? David Simon : Well, I would say, as we discussed that by and large demand is better, better sales produce for the retailer produce more interest in opening up. There's new and more retailers coming into the market all the time and the only offsetting of this is, certain retailers that are in the process of dealing with not recent problems, but legacy financial issues that have never been properly addressed. Derek Johnston : Okay. And then just to continue on the ten-anchor redev projects and the pipeline of 25 others. So, beyond the large-scale mixed use transformative redevelopment, which trust me, we think is the future. However, it's likely not justified for most reclaim Sears or other returned large boxes. So, where is that demand coming from to release this space. We've seen like lifetime athletic and some co-working facilities. Can you share any other demand you're seeing? David Simon : I don't, what do you mean, I'm not sure I understand, mode, not justified. Could you restate that please? Derek Johnston : What I mean it for all 25 projects, it's a large densification effort, maybe not justified for all markets, right. So you might be looking at a box where maybe you just want to bring in another tenant to fill it. And I'm wondering where that demand is coming from, I've seen lifetime and some co-working. Just wondering who else is kind of out there? David Simon : There is a great deal of retail demand. Frankly, we are dealing with, I call them, fitness centers, but they are frankly closed country clubs, theaters, entertainment uses. A number of the larger format retailers in many of these instances, we are adding small shop, specialty store space, because as I said prior, if we have a great property, there is demand for that property and the spaces we're getting back are spaces that are in great properties that have demand. So, there is substantial retail demand in addition just the densification efforts that we've talked about previously. Derek Johnston : Okay, thanks. David Simon : Sure. All right. Well, thanks for your questions, and we're available if you like to talk further. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. And thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Tom Ward, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Tom Ward : Thank you, Bridget. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, Vice-Chairman; Brian McDade, Chief Financial Officer; and Adam Reuille, Chief Accounting Officer. Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Please note that this call includes information that may be accurate only as of today's date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good morning. We had a very productive quarter and are pleased with our financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $3.04 per share, an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year. Our reported FFO exceeded -- per share exceeded the First Call consensus at the end of the first quarter by $0.10. Adjusting the prior year for the $11.3 million impact of expensing internal leasing cost our FFO per share growth was 7%. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio net operating income increased 1.7% compared to prior year and our comp NOI increased 1.6%. NOI growth was impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the impact of retailer liquidations and bankruptcies resulting higher bad debt expense, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and slightly and NOI, slightly lower NOI from properties undergoing significant redevelopment. Redevelopment activity is moving quickly and in some cases, it's moving quicker than we originally anticipated. For example, the transformation of Northgate in Seattle, which was originally budgeted to occur next year, will start this summer with the demolition of the mall. The NOI will be significantly reduced while we begin this massive redevelopment. These types of decisions are in the best long-term interest of the asset and our future growth. Especially when you think about a property like North Gate where we are replacing a majority of the retail with the NHL Seattle Corporate office, practice facility, ice skating facilities for the public as well as significant residential, hotel and office uses. Leasing activity remains solid, average base minimum rent was $54.34. The malls and outlets recorded leasing spreads of $14.17 per square foot, an increase of 27.3%. Reported retail sales per square foot for our malls and outlets was 660 per foot, compared to 641 in the prior year period, an increase of 3.1%. Keep in mind this growth is on top of a very strong growth throughout 2018, and reflects a late Easter and Passover as well as some recent lackluster tourism spending at some of our tourist oriented centers due to the strengthening dollar. Our malls and outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.1% an increase of 50 basis points compared to prior year. On the outlet business which we continue to drive corporately, we broke ground and it's interesting to note we broke ground on Siam, Premium Outlets in Bangkok, which is our first outlet in Thailand. This center is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2020. We are also delighted to have received approval to begin construction on our luxury designer outlet in Western Paris located enormity. The center's proximity to Paris, coupled with its affluent fashion conscious local trade area offers significant opportunity for tourists and locals. Construction actually in May of this year. Queretaro, Mexico in May will open and Malaga in Spain will open in the fall. We will also open a new outlet in Cannock, England in the fall of 2020. So let me just restate this. You're talking Bangkok. You're talking Paris. You're talking Mexico, Malaga, Spain and Cannock, England all because of our corporate resources dedicated to the outlet business and all of these will be thoughtful investments, high return on investment and add to our overall franchise value. Redevelopment activities are underway at more than 30 properties domestically and internationally across all of our platforms, where we are creating monitored, innovative, live, work, play, stay and shop communities. This includes 10 former department store space, redevelopment projects that are ongoing and we have more than 25 projects in various stages of pre development. We continue to then supply our centers with the addition of mixed use components including hotels, multifamily office and uses. As examples during this quarter, we started construction on a 430-unit multi-family residence at Round Rock Premium Outlets and construction began on 80 hotels by Marriott at Delano [ph] 177 keys, Sawgrass Mills, 174 keys as well. Our extensive identified pipeline of more than five billion in new development, the redevelopment opportunities across all of our platforms will fuel our future NOI and FFO growth and reinforce our well located properties. As many of you know, we're excited to have launched the data version of Shop Premium Outlets and are encouraged by the feedback we have received thus far. This is a unique long term investment for us, which capitalizes on the power of the Premium Outlets brand, our large base of loyal and engaged shoppers and the strong relationships we have with our retail partners. This is an opportunity to extend our reach, enhancing and deepening our relationships directly with our shopper. We look forward to a full public launch, ongoing cost in the platform. We'll continue with these costs running through our income statement. Balance sheet, our liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $7 billion. We expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in cash flow after dividend distributions, which we will use to fund the investment in our development and redevelopment opportunities. We continue to have the strongest credit profile in the industry, including net debt to NOI at 5.1 times, fixed charge cover ratios of 5.1 times and approximately 95% of our indebtedness is fixed rate, long-term issue rating of A/A2 and during the quarter, our board of directors also authorized a new common stock repurchase program with $2 billion. Today, we announced our dividend of $2.05. This is an increase of 5.1% year-over-year. Including this dividend, we have now officially paid over $100 per share in dividends to our shareholders since becoming a public company. Yet another accomplishment that separates us from others. We're also reaffirming our guidance this year in the range of $12.30 to $12.40 per share. Just in concluding, we produced another quarter of impressive results and operating metrics. We continue to operate our business with a long term view, a focus on cash flow generation, managing each asset as if it's our only asset. Our track record speaks for itself whether it's 1, 3, 5, 10, 7, 6. We have outperformed the industry and earnings cash flow and dividend growth, through the combination of our assets, people, hard work. We expect to continue our industry leading track record. And we're now ready for any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Just to clarify what's the Opry Mills settlement in your original guidance of 2020, $12.30, $12.40? David Simon : Well, Craig we don't give specific itemized guidance. As you know we do give you comp NOI guidance, and I think, it's important to remind folks that every year we have a lot of ins and outs of our company, because of our size. So this year as an example, we expect to have lower lease settlement -- lower lease settlement income from -- compared to last year. We budgeted a higher distribution income from our value retail investment, which we now expect to be lower. We have a stronger dollar than we anticipated. We're accelerating our vacant anchor and redevelopment program, as an example in Northgate, which does about 15 million of NOI. We're shutting that mall down essentially this year so that's different than our budget. And then obviously, we have some unanticipated bad debt. It's now not called bad debt, but I'll call it bad debt for this quarter because of the -- you know the bankruptcies that occurred in the first quarter. And then we have certain SPO cost. So as much as you would like us to itemize each and every aspect of our business, we will -- we don't do that. We're a big company. We've got roughly $5 billion of FFO. So, again put that in perspective. We are an earnings machine. That's how we think about ourselves. We obviously knew about the settlement when we gave you guidance. It was disclosed in our 10-K at on February 22, but when we disclose that. But we don't give itemized specific guidance because of the nature of our company is a little bit different than others. And I hope that addresses your question. Craig Schmidt : Okay great. And then on the leasing spreads that are up 27.3%. Was this impacted by anchor releasing or what drove that number higher? David Simon : Yes, I think it's generally a mix. We are taking out some less performing retailers, putting in better ones. We're not going to guide necessarily for that, that spread, but we're certainly proud of it. And our mix continues to change. We -- we have felt confident we still have leases that are under market and we expect to continue to post the positive leasing spread. Craig Schmidt : And then just finally, the month-to-month leases increased. I know this, they did that last year as well. Is there anything that happens seasonally that increases month-to-month leases in the first quarter? David Simon : Not really. I mean, a lot of -- a lot of the bigger, larger accounts just take some time and that's really all that's ongoing there. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Well, thank you. David Simon : Sure. No problem. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Jeremy Metz : David, morning. Going back to last quarter, you were expressing some caution around the closing environment and the bankruptcy that you saw lingering out there. You seem to know that you thought they were going to pick up. We've seen a number of closing announcements since that last call. So just wondering how you're feeling today, looking at what's out there and what still needs to possibly shatter here in 2019? David Simon : Well, good question, Jeremy. I think it's safe to say that we did anticipate some bankruptcies. We are looking at a few others that we'll see how they -- how the rest of the year shapes up for them. We were a little bit -- a lot of cases when you do run into a bankruptcy, you do see kind of a reward [ph] opportunity. Couple of bigger ones just liquidate it that was different than our plan. But that's what makes our company unique is that, we\u2019ll take that space back. But that's what makes our company unique is that we'll take that space back, we will lease a lot. And I don't think it will affect the long-term prospects of our cash flow generation, but it's going to take some work this year to balance that. But I think most of the bad news is behind us. I can't guarantee that. Jeremy Metz : Okay. I appreciate that color. And then just I was wondering if in terms of your tenant sales, and 3% increase, is there any sort of additional detail or just color you can provide across some of your bigger categories here to understand kind of what's helping lift that, and on the other side, what's what's dragging on it right now? David Simon : Yes, I'd think [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. David, I don't know if it's just our line, but your line it sounds like you're at a bad McDonald's drive through. David Simon : Well, I don't -- it may be your line. I haven't heard that before. Michael Bilerman : No, no. There you go. Now, now we can hear you. That's perfect. David Simon : Okay. Michael Bilerman : Thank you. You talked in your opening comments about the impact to total NOI from the increased bad debt, the foreign exchange. What you're doing at Northgate, which sounds very exciting from an NHL perspective. How much of that impacted the same store 1.6% in terms of -- I know wouldn't be the redevelopment, but I'm sure the store closures and the bad debt may have had an impact, and did that shift at all your view towards the 2% growth for the year. David Simon : Yes, I think, I said this obviously if I was in the McDonald's drive if you didn\u2019t hear it, but for Northgate has no impact on that. That's in the portfolio NOI number, because it was -- it's going through a redevelopment. The fact is though we had budgeted a lot more NOI through that this year, that's now going to go off line. So it does affect our overall $12.30 to $12.40 estimate. And I will put that in mind, remember that's $12.30 and $12.40 which I do think is the leading REIT per share earnings, but you would know that better than I would. And I -- basically the number between the stronger dollar and the extra bad debt expense is around 100 basis points. I did -- I think I said that in my commentary early, but you may not have heard that. So I \u2013 and getting to your question, the 2%. If we felt, we had to back off that, we would tell you today, listen there are no guarantees. But we have a lot of levers in this, in this company and we're going to try to achieve that to our best of our abilities. We felt it wasn't achievable, we would back off it. We are not backing off of it. I would say the biggest unknown is not necessarily future unanticipated bankruptcies, but our average rent always is you know at the -- you know we're at the mercy of retail, retailers and that's a number that we do have a little bit of volatility in it, because of our high producing properties. So yes. So that's the one element that we watch every quarter and we'll see how it shakes out. But the reality is if we wanted to back off of 2% we would tell you today that we're not at that point. Michael Bilerman : Right. Yes, I know what threw me off is when we talked about 100 basis points in the opening remarks. You talked about the impact of retailer liquidations and bankruptcies, resulting in higher bad debt, the effects and then the slightly lower NOI from properties going into redevelopment. And so, I took the 100 basis points as being total. And I was trying to get the impact just at the same store pool on that 1.6%. David Simon : Yes, it covered a little bit of both. But the reality is, the biggest comp NOI situation is because of the foreign exchange rates, and the bad debt. Michael Bilerman : And you talked a little bit about percentage rents, and that having an impact as things go through the year with all the accounting changes that got implemented this quarter. From a disclosure perspective, you've now rolled everything into the lease income line. Right. So now that has the minimum rents, the percentage rents, has a tenant reimbursements, if often has the bad debt. Can you... David Simon : Yes. You say we -- we\u2019re not its\u2019 not we talked to talked to our [Indiscernible]. Michael Bilerman : No, I get that. What all the other companies have done is, they've given us a supplemental disclosure. The way it was before in a separate page so that we can still look at the trends of reimbursement, we can look at the trends on percentage rents. We can look at what bad debt was. And so if it's possible. I think I know investors would and certainly from an analytical community we would really appreciate getting the same level information knowing that your face of the income statement furnished to the SEC is going to be the way it is. That you've presented it, but having that supplemental disclosure on each of the line items I think will be helpful as we model the company given the various pieces that do have some seasonality and volatility in them? David Simon : Well, I appreciate the comment. The reality is, we don't want to necessarily do that. So when the SEC says you can't do that, then you\u2019re asking us to do it. I'm not sure what the right approach to do that is. We take your comments certainly under advisement. For us to say bad debt, when there is no longer a bad debt, is not something we necessarily want to do, but well let's see how this year shapes out, and we're not -- we're certainly open to it, but we don't know what to call it if it's not allowed to be. It's contra revenue as opposed to bad debt expense. Michael Bilerman : Correct. No\u2026 David Simon : We don't know. It's a little -- it's a little tricky, but you know, we\u2019ll. I do think generally we disclose all the relevant facts of our company. We have an exhaustive 10-K. We have an exhaustive 10-Q. We do an 8-K. I think our industry; the REIT industry does a tremendous amount in disclosure. Much better than many other you know Corporate America. So you know, and again, I always maybe I fail at this Michael, but our company is -- it's just a little different. It's a little bigger. There's more moving pieces. We're more international, we're got more platforms. We have much lower overhead. So it's just -- we're a different, a little different animal, and to get into the nitty gritty detail that you get from all these other companies, we could -- we could argue whether it's really all that material and relevant. So we'll have that discussion for a later day. Michael Bilerman : Yes, that was just more, so trying to be consistent with what you've provided before, so that we can keep up with the trends that we've modeled the company for the last 20 years on. But happy to follow up off line and share some examples of with you as well. David Simon : Sure. Michael Bilerman : Thank you, David. David Simon : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Good morning, thanks. Looking at the development, redevelopment pipeline, yet, you raise the expected yield on that 8%. It looks like it was the new developments that are getting higher yields now. Can you just talk about what's what drove that higher? David Simon : Well I mean, it changes every, it's just the mix of a little bit. We do as I mentioned to you, we have driven through our corporate relationships, have driven the outlet business internationally. We've got some really good returns on that coming online. And then some of these redevelopments, we're taking back, anchor department stores or are driving that. But it's a mixed number, and it's subject to change quarter-to-quarter. But again, the general theme about our ability to adapt to having accretive return on investment hasn't changed. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then just going back to the online platform, it sounded like for the Simon Premium Outlet business. I mean, how is that, how is sort of early customer adoption looking there, and it sounds like you're spending money on that, but should we think about that as being additive to earnings this year in a positive way? David Simon : No. I don't think, it'll generate, you know we expect it to generate FFO losses. I'm not -- as much as I know you want to know the number, I'm not going to necessarily give it to you. Certainly, you know and again, this is one of the things that when we budgeted our initial $12.30 to $12.40 that we re-affirm. We weren't really sure whether or not we were going to get the beta or not. But, we're able to withstand, reaffirm our guidance and withstand those losses even though we got the beta. So, and we do expect to be you know for public sometime in the next few months. So those losses will go through. I would think in the scheme of our company, we can handle it. It's a long term investment and we continue to be excited about it, and ultimately be an important part of our company and our platforms. But, it's it's early days there. So I can't necessarily make specific predictions other than to say we wouldn't be doing unless we felt confident. But, -- but we'll see. Nick Yulico : Okay. Appreciate it. David Simon : No worries. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. David and Rick. I guess, I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about the leasing environment. Obviously, it was nice to see occupancy up you know 50 basis points here despite all of the closures and bankruptcies. So just -- what if you sort of think about the pipeline and the activity level, you know how would you sort of maybe stack up the pipeline today versus say a year ago, and kind of the mix of those tenants? Rick Sokolov : It\u2019s Rick, Steve. Frankly, there are still a great many tenants that are happy to have the opportunity to get in to take advantage of the inventory that we have now, that we haven't had historically. And that leasing interest is frankly accelerating. And if you think about it, we've got new retail concepts. We still have a lot of retailers internationally, they're trying to come into this market and have significant space needs. We are growing the retailers, because they all have made the decision. They need to have a bricks and mortar presence. And we still have the brand extensions from our existing retailers. So there is a lot of activity from a lot of different sources, and I think that's reflecting itself in our occupancy and in our spread. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess, David to go back to your comment earlier and this was touched on a little bit about the accelerating sort of opportunities that you have on the redevelopment side. I know you've sort of generally budgeted about $1 billion a year plus or minus. Do you see that number dramatically changing, just given the activity level that you've got or is it sort of on the margin? David Simon : Yes. I do. I do think you know I do think it's going to increase, but some of the bigger ones that we have ready conceptually of what we want to do. We're still in the midst of planning approval process. So we've got just to take two examples that are jump out at the top of my head, Brea and Stonebridge both in California. I mean are big, big developments, redevelopment I should say with a former share stores that we now control. Those are 300 plus apiece in that range, and that's not, as you know we don't we don't put that in our profile, until we get approval and both internally and obviously with the municipalities there. So, yeah it is. And we are, I mean, we are blowing and going on that front. So generally across the company, we're really, really I'd say as active as we've ever been. So the answer is, I think it's going to go up. It's a little bit out of our control in the sense not that we don't want to do it, but we have some big ones that are going through the planning process. But, I don't think it'll be 2 billion a year, it could average $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion just to give you kind of an order of magnitude. But it is -- it is active and it hasn't. It's not slowing down anytime soon. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks very much. David Simon : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. Good morning out there. David Simon : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey David. Yes, I'd echo Bilerman's comments on the disclosure. If you get your accounts comfortable with it to break out those line items that were compressed and aggregated would be -- would be helpful. One of your hallmarks has been growing cash flow annually and not you know just presenting the numbers as you grow regardless of -- if you know this quarter it seems more like an anomaly as far as what was going on the quarter between the outsides [ph] Opry Mills on our numbers it looked like NOI was late. I obviously, I can't speak for my peers, but as far as the NOI that's coming off line for the redevelopments, you mentioned that you're not going to guide line by line, but yet we're all looking at you guys making your number. Are there some points here that you can talk about maybe whether there was some onetime items that impacted NOI in the first quarter, or maybe sort of quantify what the NOI impacts are from things coming off line, that help us you know better.. David Simon : Yes. Look, I think I explained that to you. But I'm happy to do it again. I mean, we have -- we have we are. Let me just say this. I think we had a very strong quarter. And our numbers are pretty damn good. But I appreciate, I appreciate your comments. Let me, let me give you a few things just comparing quarter-over-quarter, but also keep in mind, we did lose, we did have a much. And again, it's not called bad debt expense anymore, and I know I know everybody knows that I know accounting. So you know it's not -- it's not, it's not bad debt, it's contra revenue. But we had a much, we had a much bigger bad debt expense than we did quarter-over-quarter. And that's what affected our comp NOI number now. And I also want to make sure you understand that the Opry settlement is not in our net operating income. Are you clear on that? That's in our other income area. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes of course. David Simon : Okay. So, but we also had lower lease termination income from quarter-over-quarter. That was a material number you can basically see that that was around 7, so I'll just give you a couple things. And that's why I think you'd feel a little bit better about what we -- what we produced this year. We had lower lease settlement income, $0.07. We again, we do only and I've made this perfectly clear. I made it perfectly clear last quarter. We as you know we're an investor in Value Retail. We only book. We do not book our pro rata share of net operating income or FFO. We only book when we get cash receipts. So i.e. cost, the cost method of accounting. Are you familiar with that? I am. You are, that was one of my favorite classes. The reality is we had $0.06 lower and you can see that in our 8-K obviously least capitalization foreign exchange. We did dispose of our HBS. You know HBS, Europe operations. You know that's another $0.05, $0.06 you put it all together. So that that gives you a sense, and kind of what's moving around. And again, that's what we -- that's what happens with the size of this company. And again, I try to -- I try to push people there because that's what happens. But, we did have 7% growth when you take into account, just trying to normalize the new accounting for leasing cost, which is pretty good and in a market that\u2019s dealing with a lot of bankruptcies. And then as my favorite would say, and I wrote about him once, I don't want to attribute to him but I'll say, not too shabby. Okay. Not too shabby. Alexander Goldfarb : And then can you just. David, but can you give us some context for the rest of the year, the NOI that maybe coming off line from the redevelopments? David Simon : Well, it's all in our twelve thirty to twelve forty. And again, what I was trying to explain on Northgate we had budgeted, you know the one thing we're not going to do is budget every mall and show you every mall NOI and it's just -- it's not what we're about. And again, remember to take twelve thirty five times three hundred and sixty three shares outstanding and that's our total rental total FFO. We work and I just give you a simple example, okay. We were budgeting Northgate mall around 15 million of NOI, because we thought the redevelopment of that was really going to start in earnest in 2020. That 15 million is going away, okay. That's just one example. But I'm not going to get in here about every up and down in our company because we've got -- that's not what people do when you run a big company. Okay. If you have 10 assets or I don't know who does that but that's not what public companies should be talking about. I mean, we have ups and downs on assets every time. And what you said earlier still holds true. Alexander Goldfarb : You mean that you guys just grow year after year? David Simon : We're going to grow year after year and we have $1.5 billion positive cash flow after dividends and let's keep that in mind as well. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you for your time. David Simon : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning. I'm wondering if we could talk on the leasing spreads to this quarter they were pretty high. And I guess that's understandable as department store space gets converted to higher rent uses. But I was wondering if you could comment on in line space in particular, how rents trending there? How would you compare in place rents versus market rents for that, I guess subset, but significant subset of your space? David Simon : Well, again if you look at our occupancy cost we still feel like we have a -- certainly opportunity to continue to drive spreads, and I think that hasn't changed. And then when you add the redevelopment opportunities are getting either the space back for the right price and/or lease is terminating with these boxes like you know the penny box with King of Prussia where they were basically, I don't remember, Rick, what were they paying a foot five, six\u2026 Rick Sokolov : $5. David Simon : Five bucks a foot. And we haven't even started on that one. I think there's going to continue to be the rent spreads that we have historically achieved. The environments, obviously there's a little bit more supply due to the bankruptcies. On the other hand, you know and I don't want to overemphasize this, but generally the retail community really values physical retail on one hand. On the other hand an additional hand they are now valuing who the landlord is. Who has the capital to continue to invest and evolve the product, which was the mall business has been doing for year after year, it has been around 60 years and it is always evolved during that period of time and will continue to evolve. We're in a good spot because one is they want physical retail. It's profitable to them. Two is the landlord today and I assure you this, please talk to whomever you want. You guys have a great system of information at Goldman Sachs. And it could get into the consumer business even more you'll have even more information. Is that the landlord is really, really important. It's always been. But now the ability to invest, the ability to make the products and continue to evolve is really important. We have those attributes. So we have to execute, but that's you know people are going to when they when they look to open to buys and they look to make a bet on it, we\u2019re going to be top of mind. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Rick Sokolov : The only what I think to add, David has been emphasizing the size of our enterprise when we have our -- that\u2019s statistic that millions of square feet of openings. So that's not something that's not a number they can't influence by just one or two transactions. That's a whole lot of transactions and that's a very pronounced trend. David Simon : And I'm glad you said that Rick. So when I would also say to you is that we don't feel like you know one of the reasons we've grown, the way we've grown is because we've been really decent capital allocators. So I think, Caitlin you'd say that, right? Caitlin Burrows : Yes. David Simon : You don't have to answer it. It's not fair. I don't have to say it. You can write whatever you want to write. So don't answer that. So -- and the reality is our size as Rick mentioned also allows us to say, hey, you know we'll just milk this asset because we don't believe in the long term location. So, we can actually be almost scientific. I mean our business is an art not necessarily a science, but we can be scientific about where we want to put our capital because at the end of the day not any one particular asset obviously some are more important than others is not going to make or break our company. So that again gives us the ability to be you know it kind of feeds on itself in terms of why you're a decent capital allocator, because you can be clinical in the sense about where you want to put some doubt. And I hope that makes sense to you. Caitlin Burrows : It does. Thanks. And then maybe also when we think about comp center NOI, so its 1.6% 1.6% in the quarter. I know when you guys were originally giving guidance you\u2019d pointed out that in 2019 kind of extra additions from development wouldn't be as significant this year. But now you have the growing pipeline, so I guess any commentary you could give on when we -- when you think that redevelopment activity will start to create a larger spread on that total portfolio, NOI growth versus comp center. Could we see that in 2020 or you think it would take longer? David Simon : No. I think 2020 is good because we have a lot of new developed coming online and I do think you point out very good points in that. We always thought this year was going to be a little muted because we really -- I mean the international outlets do take time. We have a couple opening this year, but most of that's open in 2020. And then we have a lot of redevelopment ongoing. It's opening in 2020. So then you've got obviously the downtime -- when you when you're restructuring a piece of real estate like Northgate then you've got a lot of moving parts about that. And literally we just made the decision, we were studying the last two or three months and we felt like look if we just go ahead and scrape the center we're going to accelerate the development. That's not great for our earnings this year, but in the long run it's the right thing to do. So, we have a we have a number of those that we just -- we're just going to try to make the right real estate decisions as opposed to short term earnings impact. But yet with all these moving parts, with all the volatility with certain retailers we're still got growth. We've still got a billion five cash flow. We still have the best dividend coverage. We\u2019re still growing our dividend and we're still had growth in our earnings. With all that said and our new investments in SPO [ph], I mean we're going to -- we're trying to land the plane at the $12.30 to $12.40 range which as my friend, not a friend. he doesn't know me but I feel like I'm a friend, not too shabby. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thanks for that. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Rich Hill : Hey, David. I saw you bought back some shares this quarter. So I was hoping you could maybe give us some color about how you think about that relative to the various different capital allocation choices, decisions that you've mentioned previously on the call? David Simon : Look, I think we have that flexibility if there's weakness in the stock, we\u2019ll get active. We've been \u2013 we did it in 2017 and 2018. It\u2019s certainly, we feel like it's a good investment and investing in our company through share buybacks is a real opportunity. And that's why we've got it. We had run out of our authorization and that's why we got -- that's why we got reauthorized. So, I expect it to be in our arsenal this year and if there's weakness in the stock well we're going to be active. Rich Hill : Got it. And then one modeling question. It looks like in 1Q 2018 and other income, you had some distributions from other international investments which maybe were not included in 1Q 2019. Is that something that we should expect to come in 2Q or 3Q or was that a one-off event in 1Q 2018? David Simon : Yes. Look, this is associated with our investments and value retail. That's one of these things that we have. I said it earlier but I'll just restate it more succinctly I hope. We cost account or that. So we only book cash income when we actually get this dividend or distribution, technically it\u2019s a distribution from the business. Last year we -- that was all associated in the first quarter. We had budgeted number this year. It looks like that number maybe, we may have over budgeted. So, but again it's a little bit harder for us to budget. So, we took our best estimate. Unfortunately it's coming in lower not because anything is going on with the business. It just -- that's just -- we're not in control of that situation. So, we don't anticipate that coming in like you're going to see that in Q3 or Q4 or Q2. So, and that's all associated, that distribution income is all associated with our interest in value retail. Rich Hill : Got it. Okay. That's it for me. Thanks you. That's very helpful. David Simon : Thank you. Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning. David, just since you're talking about capital allocation, I'm curious where is external investment, whether that's another malls, platforms or even I guess financing other malls that you might not own, fall on the spectrum of that allocation considering that your redevelopment pipeline is around 7% to 8% return. Do you give much consideration to that these days? David Simon : That's a good question. The reality is nothing has peaked our fancy at this point. I wouldn't rule it out but it's, honestly we looked at a few things, not again corporately but just the asset here or asset there. Nothing has really peaked our interest, but that's still -- we're still looking at individual assets here and there. And there could be one or two that we would add to the portfolio, Jeff. So it's still there. We're fortunate enough to be in a position where we could do that. We do have people that approaches to do stuff and if it's really good long term real estate fairly priced I mean I think we would have an interest but it's not -- we're not, I'd say we're not active, that active but it's -- I wouldn't rule it out. But we're not that active. Jeff Donnelly : Do you feel you're better served by waiting? You certainly have one of the better balance sheets, better liquidity if anyone out there in the public markets and probably private markets and access to capital is certainly key right now. Do you think you're value propositions get better the longer you wait? David Simon : That's a good question. I don't -- what do you think? Some days I wake up saying I should wait, other days, I don't know. The answer is I don't really -- it's a tough one to say. I think we've been doing the right stuff, but we're happy to take input. Jeff Donnelly : I'll hold off on that a little bit. If I could maybe for old times sake direct one toward Rick? Is it -- some of the other retail REITs out there have been saying that the challenges in the volume of tenants coming in the front door, it's the flow leaving out the back. I'm just curious with Sears and the Sears filing behind us if you will as an industry, do you think Simon has seen the peak of unanticipated tenant loss, the ones that surprise us all whether you manage that is square footage loss or rent loss. Is that all in the rear view mirror or do you think this is sort of a plateau we're going to operate at for a little while? Rick Sokolov : David mentioned it earlier, we would hope that we'd have seen the vast majority of the fallout from the over-levered retailers that just liquidated. You can never say there isn't going to be somebody else out there that goes, but we're making very good progress in releasing the space. We are getting back and we still have very good demand then. The bottom line is our properties are getting better and better, there's $1.5 billion that we're talking about. We're adding great tenants, we're renovating properties, we're adding amenities. We are making this portfolio better and more attractive to retailers. So I think we benefit in the long run from what's going on because our properties are getting stronger and others may be getting weaker. Jeff Donnelly : And actually, the last question for you David. Can you talk about the costs you see with the shoppremiumoutlets.com website and is that just merely a referral site to your retailers or are you guys engaging in fulfillment there? David Simon : Well, it's early days. Ultimately, I can't predict exactly all the services that that this business will provide. And no, unfortunately I cannot give you the cost, other than the cost of this is now again another thing when we budget our numbers we weren't really sure whether we\u2019re going to get to better or not and ultimately operating. We're now doing that. And it's kind of been in our estimates, but I can't -- I'm not going to itemize it at this point. At some point we anticipate we will, but in the meantime we're just going to accept the burden in our overall corporate numbers. Jeff Donnelly : Thanks guys. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Hi. Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Michael Mueller : Just curious how well is the bottom quartile of the portfolio holding up when you think of sales, spreads, NOI growth. Is it close to the average or is that a big gap? David Simon : It's everything is an asset by asset. Again, you've got to look at the asset in its trade area and what's going on with that trade area. I mean there are a couple of malls where we've had the department store closures. It's interesting, we've actually seen a small shops pickup from that, but it could put -- maybe there were leases in those from the department stores so those no longer are generating income. So I would say when we look at sales and everything else, there's no absolute trend that you can put a finger on and they're still holding their own. We have a big portfolio. There's always going to be a couple of assets that that put pressure on, put pressure on us, but we've been dealing with that for since I've been here that's just 30, let's see what years? Rick Sokolov : Its over 19. David Simon : Okay. So that's only 29 years. Rick\u2019s has been doing it for 63 years. I'd say, he started this when he was five, so, it would be a lot more fun. So, I mean we always have assets that put pressure on us and we figure out how to deal with it. But a couple of them where you had a couple of department stores close at the same time. Yes, they are little bit more of a pain in the neck. Michael Mueller : Okay. But it doesn't sound like there's a broad based large gap once you had a certain sales level toward the bottom? David Simon : No. It's really. It really is an asset by asset, and what -- is it the only mall in that trade area and all the typical real estate stuff. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open. Linda Tsai : Hi. The line item that you call bad debt expense isn't really bad debt expense? You said it was up a bit quarter-over-quarter. Do you think 1Q is the higher, could 2Q to be higher and when would it start to see improvement? David Simon : Well, technically it's now called a contra revenue number. So I'm not -- we don't -- we had an anomaly in Q1. We don't expect that to happen the rest of the year. So I don't know if that answers your question, but we did a much bigger contra revenue hit to our revenue this year \u2013 this quarter versus certainly last quarter and our expectations of that are to decrease. Linda Tsai : Okay. And then when you look at some of the advances that Amazon is making, most recently the availability of one day Prime shipping up from two days, do you think this \u2013 do you see this is having a meaningful impact is driving more market share shift? Some analysts have discussed the idea of shipping elasticity faster you get something the more you buy. I'm just wondering if you have thoughts about this? David Simon : Well, I mean there's -- and that's a big question lots of lots, I don't want to talk about one particular company, but that's a big question and probably I\u2019m happy to talk to you about online. I do think from a society environmental point of view we should be thoughtful about this drive for, what is it do to our environment? What does it do to our infrastructure to drive this one day shipping to whomever does it. And I don't know. We'll have to see what happens. I think our retailers do generally have a real significant advantage with the footprint that they have because the bottom line pickup in store doesn't cause extra transportation and environmental cost. It already exists and it does -- the consumer does want convenience and speed and it seems to satisfy that desire. So, we'll see how that offsets against the one day shipping. But I don't really have any other comment than that. Linda Tsai : And then final one; how do you feel about the retail environment in the U.K? What are some of the similarities or just similarities you see with the U.S. right now? David Simon : While in the U.K, we're only in the outlet business. And right now with the pound it's actually pretty decent. So, we don't have any pull price in England and with the pound a little bit weaker tourism, okay, we're building a new center there that we think will be good. I mean, there is some trepidation from retail commitments on the new stuff. But long term we don't expect any real inability to lease outlet up. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of in Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Good morning. So, talking about your shop Premium Outlets platform it's an interesting idea and there's probably a lot of upside from data analytics to the fees or just being more involved in the ecosystem. So, a couple of questions. One, how the demand pipeline looking from other retailers wanting to sign on? And second, while there is kind of interesting single interface in the backend piping is actually at nine different retailers that are funneling up their different systems and shipping methods to SPO. And for example if I'm a customer that want to buy one thing from each retailer, I would get nine different packages and pay potentially nine different shipping fees. I realize this is just a beta version, but longer term how do you think about that? And do you to offers kind of singular shipping and make it really work? David Simon : Well, I think, listen, you can't -- when you build something it's like building a shopping mall. When you build something, you know what that mall is today maybe something what it is it's going to be different five years from now. So I think we -- that's how we're thinking about that. And I think all the great Internet companies and startups and all of the new technology companies have all started with one product, one idea and then morphed into several. I mean obviously you can look at Amazon, Google as prime examples about where they started and where they end up. You can look at we works. You know they call themselves we company now because they go in different directions. So I think you have to put that -- we're not even close to those companies, but we have to think about our product just along those lines and that we start somewhere as we get traction we add to it. So in direct response to your questions I will say we're adding more retailers. We do have a universal shopping cart. And yes you're right, we're not in the fulfillment business today but one day we could be, one day we could be doing it from the mall or the outlet. So we'll have to see how it transpires. But it is early days. And I think the retail receptivity has been rewarding otherwise we wouldn't have started. If the retailers hadn't expressed an interest in our product, we would have killed it couple years ago. Ki Bin Kim : And you bring up an interesting point about the Internet companies, but they're also kind of bound by a different set of rules versus Simon, I mean I think it feels like the focus is on lot more revenue than expenses, almost like 90-10. But for your company, a cash flow driven company, the markets probably are a little bit more hesitant to allow you to express losses for the sake of kind of a longer-term revenue potential. So how do you, how do you think about that dynamic? David Simon : Well, I guess, I guess what I would say to you is there is nobody that values cash flow more than me. And I think you know that, right? So we're getting into this business, it's got -- we're going to invest in it like we invest in our real estate product. If we thought -- and I -- there is no guarantees. You're right, it could, maybe we don't find the secret sauce, maybe we don't get the consumer buy and maybe this maybe that. But there is nobody that values cash flow more than, more than me. And we've got enough of free cash flow that is to build this platform and see where it goes, and if we, if we're not successful then we're big people and we'll go on to the next. In the meantime, we're not going to risk the company. It's not make or break, it's -- I don't want to say it's on the margin, but this is what we do, we invest in our products and this is just another produc. Ki Bin Kim : All right. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with BTIG. Your line is open Jim Sullivan : Okay. Thank you. David, not to beat a dead horse, but I just want to be absolutely clear in this, when you have the insurance recovery out of the operating mills this quarter, I think you made it clear, but I just want to confirm that those recoveries are not in operating income, right? David Simon : That\u2019s correct. Jim Sullivan : Okay, good. David Simon : It's absolutely correct. And by the way, it wasn't a recovery. Well, it was a recovery, but we had to actually litigate to get the recovery. So it was a settlement of the lawsuit, but that is not in our net operating income to be absolutely clear. Jim Sullivan : Okay, good. Thank you. Second question. You've talked and written for a couple of years about kind of the industry issue about over-levered private equity owned retailers and how they conduct their business and how it's really not been good for your business. It appears, and I don't know maybe Rick can chime in on this, but the so-called digitally native retailers that some quarters have written a lot about appear to be in the early stages of doing a series of IPOs, we'll see if they're successful, but a few of them who I think are in your centers are talking with underwriters and we may be entering a phase where the next phase of capital formation in terms of who's company in the front door as opposed to who is going out the back door. Maybe a group of well-capitalized maybe profitable maybe not, retailers who are going to raise a significant amount of capital in the public market, we'll see if that develops. But I'm just curious from your standpoint, do you regard these this new retail, this new development of retailers as a material source of incremental demand or not? David Simon : Well, I would generally say yes, but I think we're early days in it. I don't expect suddenly a 60 store or a 100 store expansion from the folks, but I do think -- and with all the -- with all of the changes that have occurred in our industry and with all the changes that have occurred in corporate America, I will say this, the entrepreneurialism, the idea, the ability to get something funded, the idea to create a new concept has never been greater. That's terrific for us. We want to nurture those. In fact, we're not opposed to helping those folks grow their business and in some cases we'll invest in that. There is nothing -- I'm not saying that it wouldn't be great not to -- people -- I don't necessarily love people shopping online, Jim, as you might imagine, but this technology has allowed just a lot more entrepreneurs to get started. And I think that's terrific and we're embracing that and trying to help them in every way we can and I think it's good. Are they at the point now where they're going to do a 100 stores a year, no, but in some cases 20, 30, 40 stores. Rick, I don't know if you want to add? Rick Sokolov : The other thing that I would say and it's sort of related but different; there have been several announcements about companies spinning off various businesses. Historically what we have found is when these new businesses are formed their first call is to ask to figure out how they can grow that business because now they have a dedicated management team and dedicated source to capital and a much more focused growth strategy because there are standalone business and that there is something that going on right now that I think is going to augur well for us in the future as well. Jim Sullivan : So green shoots, but not maybe material element at this point? Rick Sokolov : There is activity and we're taking advantage of it and it's more than isolated instances. I mean we're working with scores on these retailers online and they are all agreeing that having a bricks and mortar presence is an essential component of their overall offering. So that is a very good thing and we're taking advantage of it because they're going to the better properties which we have. Jim Sullivan : Okay. Very good. Thanks guys. David Simon : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Wes Golladay : Yes. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick follow up on Jim's question and we talked about the digitally native tenants, but are international tenants coming to the U.S. a bigger portion of the leasing versus the digitally native? And then who is driving the majority of the shop lease, and is that still the existing tenants? Rick Sokolov : Well, international tenants think about international, H&M is an international tenant, Zara is an international tenant, Uniqlo is an international tenant. These, all -- these tenants all have substantial space needs and are looking to have the United States become a major market as part of their global footprint. So they're a much more significant source of demand right now than the online retailers. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then the existing, I guess the leasing you're seeing right now, is it still more domestic tenants or is it the International tenants actually exceeding those right now in the open to buys? Rick Sokolov : It's hard to say in terms of comparing the two. They both have significant demand and that's been reflected in our occupancy. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thank you very much. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hong Zhang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Hong Zhang : Hey guys. Two quick questions from me. I guess number one, are you still expecting any business interruption insurance from Puerto Rico? And would you be able to provide what the sales per square foot number is on an NOI-weighted basis? David Simon : Yes. On Puerto Rico, no. And then on the NOI-weighted number is sales $8.42. Hong Zhang : Do you know what it was last year, 1Q 2018? David Simon : [Indiscernible] Hong Zhang : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. Just along Ki Bin's line of questioning, I just wanted to focus on XPO a little bit. First of all I wanted to -- if you could just remind us what economics of that business is in regards to what kind of deals you strike with the retailers when someone actually does buy a product through the site? And then second of all, also wanted to understand the competitive advantages of the platform in regards to what stops one of your competitors from doing a very similar thing? A - David Simon Well, okay. Well now the answer is we're not -- we get a percent of revenue, and just like we get in our in our leases today. So it's very similar. We get very much what marketplace driven internet side would get. We get a percent of revenues. Our competitive advantage and I'm sorry, I kind of you know we have great premium outlet portfolio, where the consumer knows what we stand for in that business, both internationally and domestically. We had terrific CEO relationships at the retailers across the board. We're known in through our Simon Venture Group and we're known in the technology space. We've got personal investor relationships throughout. We have the wherewithal to make the investment. And it's a little more complicated about why we chose initially outlets versus malls. I don't really want to go through that. But, I do think we have competitive advantages that a few have. But, I guess somebody could try and do it, but we'll see. Omotayo Okusanya : But there's nothing contractually that prevents a retailer from signing on to a similar platform, if someone else tried to do it? David Simon : No, not at all. Omotayo Okusanya : Great. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. David Simon : Yes, no worries. Thank you. Okay. I think that is the last of the questions. So we appreciate all the comments, questions and input and we'll talk you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Tom Ward : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; also on the call are Rick Sokolov, Vice-Chairman; Brian McDade, Chief Financial Officer; and Adam Reuille, Chief Accounting Officer. Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of the risk factors relating to those forward-looking statements. Please note that this call includes information that may be accurate only as of today's date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR Web site at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter, and are pleased with our financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $1.06 billion or $2.99 per share. Adjusting for the prior year for a non-cash investment gain [indiscernible] IPCO [ph], ABG Exchange and the impact of external leasing cost, our FFO growth rate was 4.9% per share. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Our comp NOI increased 2% for the second quarter, and total portfolio NOI increased 1.6% for the quarter. Retail bankruptcies in the second quarter impacted our comp NOI by over a hundred basis points. Year-to-date comp NOI has increased 1.8%. And to put this in perspective, our comp NOI grew 3.6% in '16, 3.2% in '17, last year 2.3%, and we continue to comp it on a NOI base of more than $5 billion. Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $55.52. And or leasing spread was $16.53 per square foot, an increase of 32.3%. And we're pleased that our sales momentum from our retailers continued in the second quarter. Reported retail sales per square foot for our malls and outlets was $669 per foot, compared to $646 in the prior year period, an increase of 3.5%, and just to give you a fun fact, we have over 77 properties; that's right 77 properties that if you average their total sales will be over $900 a foot. So 77 over $900 a foot, and you can see that clearly as our report retail sales on an NOI weighted basis of $852 compared to the $669 per foot occupancy would be 95.5% compared to 94.4%, and our average base minimum rent would be $73 -- a little over $73 per foot. New development, we broke ground on a luxury outlet in Normandy, which is our first designer outlet in Western Paris, Catchment Area and our third outlet in France. This center is projected to open in the second quarter of 2021. Construction continues on the three international outlets in Malaga, Spain; Bangkok, Thailand; West Midlands, England, all open in 2020. Queretaro, in Mexico, opened and its full grand opening will be in the fall of this year. We continue to expand our international outlet presence in growing markets adding to our overall franchise value with high rates of return. And as I mentioned to you in the press release today, we have 42 international outlets after we finish the four that are currently under construction. Redevelopment, just the highlights, a lot going on, as you know, so we have 30 properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally with our share of net cost of approximately $1.7 billion. Our extensive identified pipeline is over $5 billion in new development or redevelopment across all our platforms. These significant redevelopments and transformations will continue to fuel our profitability. Importantly, we will fund these accretive projects through our internally generated cash flow. And they'll continue to serve our communities. As you know, our properties generate significant property taxes and significant sales taxes for their jurisdictions that fund the police, fire, schools, et cetera. So we continue to play a very, very important role in the livelihood of our communities that we operate in. Now, going to liquidity, you'll be pleased to know that we have $6.8 billion of liquidity, and that is net of our outstanding CP balance. During the quarter, we purchased 1.05 million shares of common stock. We continued, in July, to purchase another 630,000. So we have combined, over the last essentially four months, 1.68 million shares of repurchase. And this further is represented by our strong balance sheet, which continues to be a far significant advantage in our area. We announced a dividend increase. We're now paying $2.10. That's an increase of 5% on a trailing 12-month basis ending June 30. Over the last three years our dividends have grow at more than 8%. Another fun fact which I'm here to supply to put our dividends as a public company, we have paid more than $30 billion, three-zero billion to our shareholders in cash in dividends, pretty good number. As reminder, our annualized current dividend yield of more than 5% is 300 basis points higher than the 10-year treasury, and our dividend is more than one-and-a-half times covered by our annual FFO. We continue to reinforce our guidance at 12.30 to 12.40 despite some headwinds, which include lower lease settlement income, lower distribution income from our international investments, stronger dollar, obviously all the redevelopment that's going on with our anchors, accelerated redevelopment including, say, Northgate, some of the unanticipated bankruptcies, and some of our SPO costs which we're now accelerating. So to conclude, we produced another good quarter of results and operating metrics. There's no company in our industry that has the reach and impact on the communities that we have. And we continue to focus on the long-term, we'll continue to invest in our product and generate the kind of returns that will grow our earnings, cash flow, and dividends. And we're now ready for any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Jeremy Metz : David, I was wondering if you could break it down for us to then talk about what you're seeing on the mall front in terms of trends in traffic versus what you're seeing in the outlets, anything that's going better than you expected so far this year, even lagging a bit, and maybe just as a follow-on, what your expectations are that you have built in for Dressbarn here. David Simon : Well, I would say, and recon way in the mall business, sales are up, traffic is reasonably good. I say it's -- there's ups and downs, but overall it's up slightly. In the outlets business we're skewed a little bit more toward the tourism. And because of the strong dollar and some of the implications of what's going on in the global environment, traffic there is flattish, but sales are more flattish. And that's really a function of the big tourist centers in the outlet business that are essentially flat where we would expect them to be up. Overage rent is up in the mall business. It's a little under plan in the outlet business. So I'd say, generally, it's, absent the strong dollar and absent what the decrease in overall tourism in the U.S., we would be performing well ahead of our plan. Obviously the unanticipated bankruptcies is something we're dealing with. Yet, even with that, we've produced the 2% comp NOI growth. And I missed your last -- what was your -- well, Dressbarn is, it is what it is. We'll see what happens, insignificant to us in the scheme of our operation. Rick? Rick Sokolov : The only thing that I would add is that the trends that David talked about are manifesting themselves in the interest that we're seeing from our retailers. There's still a steady stream of retailers that are seeking to find space in our property. And the properties continue to get better through the addition of retailers that are making a difference in our trade area presence. Jeremy Metz : Appreciate that. And David, can you just talk about the investment in Black Ridge and Allied eSports, just what drove this and what sort of larger opportunity you possibly see here with that? David Simon : Well, look, I think we do think obviously there's a huge momentum going on about the eSports and venues. And we have, just like the exhibition theater business, I mean the mall is a great place to host those kind of events, and in a setting like that drives sponsorship income, drive traffic, reinforce our real estate as kind of the place to be for the community. So we've got lots of options beyond just Allied about brining those kind of venues to our real estate. And in fact the explosion on the location-based entertainment area is incredible from kind of where it was a decade ago to where it is today. So we have essentially a dedicated team that's looking at all sorts of operations and venues that we're going to be brining to our real estate that will broaden the mix, invest in the community, increase traffic, bring sponsorship opportunities, food and beverage. And given the department store -- getting those department stores back in a lot of cases or buying them back in some cases gives us the real estate that we've never had before to bring them into the mall. So that's what's really exciting that, yes, it's a lot of work, yes we have to be focused. But we now have the ability, where we didn't have it before, to bring all sorts of those venues into our real estate. So brought a team on essentially just to deal with the, for no better word the location-based entertainment concepts, just to go through that so that we could bring them to the centers. And again, we now have in some cases the real estate to put them in where we didn't have it otherwise. And we can do it at accretive returns. Rick, would you like to add anything? Rick Sokolov : Only thing I would add is that we've been doing this for over a decade, because we have a very large relationship with Merlin through our Mills portfolio, and we've got a great set of experiences there that demonstrate the viability of our properties for these types of uses. So we're building off of strength to implement the initiatives David just talked about. Jeremy Metz : All right. And last from me, and just sticking somewhat along those lines is, and looking back at the investment you made in Aero alongside ABG and your experience you've had since that time, how do you think about making similar investments? Would you do it? Would you -- what would you look for just given some of the distress that I wonder if this is something we could see you guys do again here at some point in the near-term? David Simon : Well, look, I think it's very possible we're going to be very smart about it, Jeremy. Now, it's interesting because, as you know, we authentic plans grew just to the private placement where we decided to keep our stock, but certain shareholders sold and new shareholders came in, and we decided not to keep our entire interest. So we didn't sell down because we believe in the company. But that stake, based on its current raise in terms of new shareholders coming in, is worth $153 million, and we basically put no money in it. We still have the Aero OpCo, which is -- we own 44%, and it's going to do $65 million EBITDA thereabouts. So I think we're not too bad at this investment. We're certainly as good as the private equity guys when it comes to retail investment. And so I wouldn't rule it out, but I mean we've made a ton of money in Aero, and we love being partners with authentic brands group. And we will work together on other distress situations. And let's face it, there are some out there. So -- but we will get a pie into companies that we think have brand and that have the volume that is worth going to sell. They just bought Sports Illustrated. I think they have got a great the intellectual property there. I think it's got a great future with company like ABG to focus on. We may invest Mad as an example. There could be Sports Illustrated eSports, gaming, food & beverage. And we will be at the forefront to try and to be as creative as we can. Now with our real estate that you cannot duplicate, and again, while we serve the community, we pay significant real estate taxes, significant -- our retailers and us pay significant sales tax. And we are investing in our properties to obviously for our shareholders but also for the benefit of these communities. Jeremy Metz : Thanks for the time. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from with Citi. Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning everyone. David Simon : Good morning. Christy McElroy : Just off of Jeremy's last question but maybe from a little bit of a different angle. Given that past experience with Aero and Nautica and the insights that you have gain from these investments, and you have also talked about being on many creditor committees in the past. How are you approaching retailer restructurings and bankruptcies differently than in the past, or maybe differently than what some of the other mall REITs have the capability to do that maybe gives you a competitive advantage with tenant fallout and bankruptcy activity having picked up again this year? David Simon : Well, that's a good question. I would say we have another -- what is it called, quiver in my -- what is it -- arrow in my quiver? Rick Sokolov : Arrow in your quiver. David Simon : Arrow in my quiver, I always like reverse when I am supposed to say it. Rick Sokolov : Robin is looking out. David Simon : But now I would say we certainly have the ability to help beyond what you might do on the leases become an investor in a distress situation. So we have the ability. I am not sure we would do it alone, but with somebody like ABG we have obviously worked well with historically General Growth and now Brookfield. So we have kind of the ability together or even individual or some combination thereof to look at becoming more than just a real estate player, but a buyer of these brands. So that's the difference -- that's the majority difference. We also have the ability to underwrite the business pay lot better than we could have. So, we are left in the dark about what the right rent should be in a workout scenario, and we have resources, I mean the folks at the Aero, OpCO -- the folks at ABG are friends with Brookfield, and our team can basically rapidly run through any kind of investment or retail scenario and find out -- get to the bottom of what the right fix is. And I would say to you we were decent at it a few years ago, but now we are pretty good at it. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just with the straight line rent adjustment elevated in Q2 and somewhat volatile over the last couple of quarters. Wondering if you could provide some insight into what's driving that perhaps impacted by some of the lease accounting stuff? And how we should think about the impact to GAAP non-cash rent adjustments for the full year? David Simon : Yes. With the new capacity pronouncements, we --historically we have never straight lined our camp even though as you know a lot of our camp is not -- most of it, 95% of it is fixed with a growth in it. And I believe a lot of our peer groups historically have straight lined that. So, we have to straight line that because of the new pronouncement, and that's really the change in that. Again, our content OI Christy as, you know, takes out any straight-line impact. So it's basically cash. And but that's basically all there is to it. When you look at kind of the increase in straight line less the -- now that we can't capitalize our leasing costs, I mean, it's basically less than 1% differential, in terms of our FFO per shares, it's one way to look at it, but the reality is, if you look at the comp NOI, we strip it out in any event, but it's simply we never straight-line comp expense. And that we have. Christy McElroy : Okay. So we should expect it to remain elevated going forward, because of the straight line? David Simon : Well, certainly this year. Then I think you'll see it more normalized. Now, we also write-off strictly, we have to rise -- when you have a bankruptcy, we've had straight-line write-offs this year, because if you have a tenant that goes into bankruptcy, and yet you certainly any straight-line rent or straight-line candidate, you may have for that tenant. It's going to be written off. So we've had certainly some of that as well. Christy McElroy : Got it. Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning, I guess just a couple of questions first, maybe to just start on kind of the leasing environment. I mean, you and Rick touched on it a little bit that there's good demand. I mean, can you just elaborate a little bit more, you said you've been impacted about 100 basis points from bankruptcies this year. And I'm just wondering, David, you just sort of look at the tenant watch list and the, potential tenants, you're still kind of working with the restructure? Where do you sort of feel like we are in that kind of pendulum or timeframe of kind of getting to the end of that and, just 2020 kind of begin to show a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel? David Simon : Well, I still think there are a couple up there, without naming names, Steve that we're monitoring. And, we'll have to see kind of where that goes. So it's hard for me to give you an exact, response specifically to the question, other than there are still a couple out there that we're monitoring we'll see how it ultimately reside? I will tell you, not that this is of interest, but it's not a reflection of our business. Okay. And I know that's hard to say, that's hard to. I know that's a statement that many don't believe but if you look at the bankruptcies, each one of these folks, there were things and decisions that they did that led them to that point. As opposed to it, this it's our business, okay. And I won't go through names, but lack of investment, too much leverage, opening two biggest stores going international, when they should have stayed domestic, picking the wrong mark, it's not endemic of our business, and that's the important point, because the reality is, even with these bankruptcies that we've had to deal with, we are comping up, yes, it's not where I'd like to see it, but it's still comping up a couple of percent. And we would have really outperform had we not had the unanticipated bankruptcies. We are outperforming an overdraft in the mall business underperforming and the outlet business because of the tourism that I showed you. So there's pros in that in what we're seeing in sales there, the higher end continue to do well, as I mentioned to you, we have 77 properties, in total, would get you over if you just took the top seven, and we'd be over 900 bucks a square foot, so it's not endemic of our business or our industry. It's each one of these, each one of these has a story and I could spend three hours going through pros and cons as to what decisions they made that led them to that problem. And that's the most important message I can deliver to you. today. It's not quote and again, we're much more diversified than the mall business. But let's talk. It's not the mall business. It's certain folks that ran their business, not in the best way. And yes, we suffer while we re-characterize or reach lease the space to better operators. So I'll turn it over to Rick to add any implication to your question. Rick Sokolov : And part of that is demonstrated by the fact that our occupancy trends have held up very nicely in spite of all that bankruptcy. And as we detailed in the past, there is still a broad array of tenants that are seeking to come to our properties, whether they're new concepts, whether they are digitally native retailers, whether they are international retailers, we still have retailers that are traditional retailers, like [indiscernible] that are still growing significantly. And we are adding a lot of food to our property. And all of that is contributing to the fact that you're seeing our sales growth, and you are seeing our NOI growth. Steve Sakwa : Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks. David, just a small point, on the total portfolio, NOI was up less than comp, which is not normally the case. And your share of NOI from investments was down. Is there anything kind of just for us to focus in on as we think about or\u2026 David Simon : Well, remember, we sold our interest internationally in HPS. That's the biggest reduction. And in addition, we've got a lot of redevelopment going on, you could see that number, we have a number of properties that are basically taking a step back, because of our redevelopment efforts. But those are the biggest ones that jumped out at me, right. So -- and Tom just mentioned to me FX as well. So when you put the -- I'd say those are the three things. So HBS has gone internationally, FX, currency, and then the redevelopment, as you can see, where we have a number of properties that are kind of going down a little bit this year as we redevelop it -- Burlington mall, Ross Park Mall, and a handful of these that we're taking a step back to take several steps forward. So that's basically the map. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. And then lastly, I just noticed, the average base rent per foot, which, takes into a lot of things, including lease restructurings and others was up a more modest I guess, 1.2% to 1.3%. Anything, we should just be thinking about that number, versus say the least spreads you're getting and obviously the change in occupancy that I was curious on that trend? David Simon : No, I'd say it's basically a function of, some of the workouts that we're having to deal with. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks a lot. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line up Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I wondered if you could categorize the store closing and then outlet space versus the mall space. Is it, are they experiencing store closing through a comparable degree or the more meaning to the malice? David Simon : I would say they're the last few bankruptcies have also had outlet exposure. So, they are more comparable where a couple years ago it was more the mall than the outlets and now, they're similar there's not -- there's not a trend that outlets or better or worse than, than the than the malls and when it comes to store closings due to bankruptcies, I'd say they're. They're more similar in terms of that pattern. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then obviously very active in redevelopment. I wondered if it is possible to categorize what do you mean you think you're in, in terms of the major anchoring position. I recognize you're always going to need to do it but in terms of this major push for anchor repositioning, maybe what do you need more then? David Simon : Well, I never been much of a baseball player but I would say what and I would say the third -- maybe three so he and I hit the number at the same time. I'd say the third inning. Craig Schmidt : Okay, great. Thank you very much. David Simon : Thank you, Craig. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, Good morning. Good morning out there. Out there it's not that, it's not like we're in -- it's not like we're in outer space. We are not on the moon. We're [indiscernible] here. David Simon : Yes, well\u2026 Alexander Goldfarb : I think it's kind of like Neil Armstrong. Okay, he is very thoughtful. David Simon : Right. Alexander Goldfarb : Straightforward guy. Go ahead, Simon. David Simon : Okay, perfect steady hand at the landing. Alexander Goldfarb : Just two questions here first, David, sort of following up to Christie's question, the jump in; so two-part question on the leasing spreads from straight line rent. So one, how much of the increase of straight-line rent is any of that due to increase leasing activity, because looking at the leasing spreads, they've really jumped over the past year. So I don't know if that's purely mix, or maybe this is the benefit of backfill, but if I look at your TIs over the past year, they've gone up a little bit, but nowhere near as much as the rent spreads have jumped. So just trying to understand how much of the jump in rent spreads is purely just mix, versus its actually you guys getting better tenants, and maybe some of that is leaking into the higher straight-line rent? David Simon : Well, we certainly continue to straight-line our rental income, beyond comp. I don't have the breakdown for you, but it does add into that amount we continue. I mean, there's rent spreads, continue to be healthy, obviously, a lot of that will be significantly enhanced, as we're getting back, very, cheap space that we can rent it, I mean, that's going to be the future growth of the company is taking back the some of the bigger spaces and generating much greater rental income from them. And, that's why we're spending the capital. So it all kind of feeds into each other in terms of generating our cash flow future NOI growth, leasing spreads. And obviously, that'll be part of the straight-line, rent income as well. Rick Sokolov : And I would just confirm your observation that our tenant allowances have been very stable over the years, and there has not been a noticeable increase at all. It's business as usual at the testing. Alexander Goldfarb : Should they -- Rick, the rising -- releasing spreads, it just is purely mix, or we should expect these, I mean, just wondering next few quarters, it is going to go down to more in the mid-teens or these going to stay elevated? Rick Sokolov : That's why you have a job. Okay, you'll, see when it happens, okay, but the bottom-line is that's why we have a job -- the bottom-line is, we are certainly one of the greatest opportunities we've had, as a company and I can't underestimate yet some people could look at, the demise of certain anchors as a sign of, impending doom, we look at -- we'd look at it in the complete reverse, as a significant opportunity, because we are now getting the ability to take that space, and redevelop it with a creative returns on investment and higher rents. And so, I do think that trend will continue. Whether it'll be up five bucks down, that's just -- that's a quarter-to-quarter change. But that is -- that's why we're spending -- that's why we have a $5 billion pipe. I mean, that is our business going forward. And it's important for the market to understand, I mean, that's where we see great opportunity. Alexander Goldfarb : Right. Rick, I just want to make sure the budget like this wasn't like a definitional change, or something accounting change. I'm just trying to get to, because obviously, it's impressive. So just want to understand if this is definitional change or accounting change or\u2026 Rick Sokolov : Not at all. Not at all. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is just quantifying obviously got Forever21 pretty small, but overall, your comments about what your guidance has endured as far as headwind stronger U.S. dollar, tourism, all this stuff, where are you guys trending as far as your bad debt budget. So presumably your budget whatever it is 100 basis points or something like that for the year, where are you trending on whatever your budget is, where you are trending on that year-to-date? David Simon : I would say we are higher. I mean I don't have exact number, but it's higher than what we -- certainly higher than what we budgeted because we had some anticipated bankruptcies. Unfortunately when we do our model, it's the end of last basically November -- October - November. We are now in July. And we've had a lot of stuff that we had to deal with. So, it's definitely higher than what we budgeted. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good morning. Maybe on the leverage side, net debt NOI has been coming down to 5.1 times now. And I think investors do like to see this. So, I was just wondering what's driving this decision from the Simon side versus spending more on say development buybacks or something else. David Simon : Well, look, we try to manage the balance sheet with great care. And so, we do have a -- the pipe we can -- we have not capital constraints on the pipe, but really human resource and permitting constraints. And obviously, we are very focused on supply and demand in those particular markets because as you know a lot the redevelopment efforts are going to be kind of mixed use element. So -- but we can only go as fast as the permits and our human resources can do it. And it does take certain markets specially California where we have a pretty big pipe and in Seattle with Northgate a huge development there -- development that based on phasing, but -- and over a period of time and the approval process there is going very well, but that's a spend that could approach a billion dollars given the opportunities we see with that site. So unfortunately, we got to tear them all down first each time, which were -- I think we will start in eight days, right? So I think that -- to get back to your question, I think the biggest constraint is really just human resources and permitting. So, it's not -- listen we don't want to be carried away with the balance sheet. And as Rick mentioned, I mean we are very -- every once in awhile, we will take on a flyer on development or redevelopment, but we certainly when it comes to -- allowance comes to capital, as you can see over the history of the company we are very, very, very thoughtful on that. I mean we don't bat a 1000 you see I am using the baseball analogy but we -- so we are very thoughtful on that. And then, I think the buyback -- look, we are going to be opportunistic. REITs will always be and I think I read, not to quote Steve Walk [ph] because we don't want to give him a big hit, but I do think REITs are always going to be somewhat limited on buybacks compared to industrial America because of our need to pay out our taxable income obviously to maintain the REIT status. And that's why if you leave with anything in this call is we had paid out $30 billion, that's with the D, dividend in the history of this company, which is pretty damn remarkable I think. Tom, you agree? Tom Ward : Agree. David Simon : Okay, so -- and so it will always be something nice to do, but we are always going to be somewhat constrained just because we are paying out so much capital and dividend. Now the reality is we would buy -- we didn't have to pay out on our taxable income and we would be a cash flow machine, we would buy a tremendous amount of product check. So it will always be there for us to be opportunistic but we can't overwhelm given our pay out on the dividend front. Caitlin Burrows : Got it, okay. And then maybe just you do have a history of raising FFO guidance the vast majority of quarters in the past. So, just wondering if you could give some detail on how maybe results played out during the quarter. How that related to your own budget and what prevented you from raising the full-year guidance. I know that in previous set of questions you did mention potentially that bad debt was trending a little higher than you had originally predicted. David Simon : Yes, I probably bored you. But the reason we haven't raised guidance this year is a few things. And I will just restate what I said. We have lower lease settlement income than we had budgeted. We have lower distribution income from our interest -- essentially in value retail. We don't equity cap for that. As you know we cash account -- cost accounting. Not to bore you I don't know what you background is, but cost accounting -- cost accounting still exist, correct? Brian McDade : Yes\u2026 David Simon : If you know how old I am, but cost account -- basically we only book with what cash we get. So anticipate a little bit higher distribution income from our investments and value retail. We haven't gotten -- we have the stronger dollar. Obviously we had unanticipated bankruptcies. We didn't budget SOP though we kind of knew that we might do it, we just -- it's kind of out there and we decided well, it's out there and then obviously the anticipated bankruptcies. On average rent, we are trending above in the mall business, but below in the outlet. And I have explained that basically it's not a function of the business, it's a function of tourism and a strong dollar being basically reduced in the country, and we are not the only company in America that's telling you that. You can see that and from a number of different lives. Caitlin Burrows : Got it, okay. David Simon : So that's basically -- so that's what's been going on and why we haven't raised guidance this year. Caitlin Burrows : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Hi, David. Good morning. First of all, thanks for reporting prior to the open. It's nice and refreshing to have it mixed up from deluge of companies reporting after the close. I appreciate the color on FFO guidance. And I wanted to also maybe talk about retail overall and maybe how you are thinking about some of your investments. So maybe first, could you maybe give us an update on your [indiscernible] stake and if you would think about increase that? It looks like that's been a pretty good investment, and then maybe also an update on the test [Ph] consumer facing platform as well. David Simon : Okay, so having just been in a board meeting last week, I think that they are doing an excellent job. They are very well positioned. Their balance sheet which continues to be much better than their peer group, and their cash flow their like for like I can't remember exactly what the number was, but I thought it was pretty good given what's going on and continue to sell asset sure of the business. And what we have seen is a company that continues to operate better and better over the years that we have invested. I would say you -- it's unlikely we would ever -- I mean if we go over 30, I don't know if you know the rules, we have to offer the whole company. I would say it's not in our plans to ever to do that right now. But, I mean it's certainly in our option that we would have down the road, but it's not in our plans at all. So, with that said -- and then our SOP, we have -- we are still invaded. We have got 12 retailers, 3000-ish brands on online, we're going through kind of the kink, so you can have access to it. If you are one of our loyalty members, we got another 15 or so that's in the process of coming on board. And our plan is to make it public sometime in the third quarter. And I'd say to you, we've got a lot of interesting things going on with that platform. Beyond just that, but I can't really share much beyond that other than stay tuned. I do think we can have a -- I do you think we can create a real business opportunity for us in this area. Rich Hill : Got it. That's it for me. Thanks for the transparency and thoughts David. David Simon : Sure, no problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks, David. I just want to go back to the topic of redevelopment and also tied into questions about total portfolio NOI growth. And I think we can appreciate how redevelopment and disruptive NOI process with some attractive payoff down the road. But we get a sense of timing of, when this will start to benefit overall portfolio growth because it's not showing up in the numbers this year. And if you mentioned your guess, is that we're in a third inning of this process. I mean, does this mean that it's going to be an ongoing drag on total portfolio NOI growth, or does this change at some point in the next year or so\u2026 David Simon : Again, just to be clear I -- there are three major elements on that. One is the -- that's where the currency, stronger dollars hurt us. Number two is we sold an asset for when you sell an asset, you don't have the income. Okay. So, and then the third element is our redevelopment. So, the reason that the properties there are relatively flat, and normally, we would see growth there. So I just want you to put that in perspective. So with that said, I'll address your question. Look, I think you'll start to see benefits in 2020 later, but you know, it takes time, I mean, that's -- the reality from a new development point of view. You know, we don't have a lot. So a lot of the driving as a new development was through that line, we did decide to more or less buy the land and also to build also premium outlets yesterday, and the outlet there. So that's a go project. We still have some hurdles to do. But that's pretty much so. So I, and that's open in 2021. And we've got a lot of the International outlets are really open in late 20 and early 21. So it's going to take time. Now, Nick, here's the important thing. You will never hear from this company. We will have a throwaway year. Okay, so even with kind of like yes, it's not that exciting. We're not going to tell you wait for next year. Wait, we don't wait for good deal. Okay, not here. So, yes, we're, it's going to accelerate, but we're worried about '19 and '20 and '21. So we don't have throwaway years. Nick Yulico : All right. I appreciate it. That's helpful. Thanks, David. David Simon : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai from Barclays. Linda Tsai : Hi, your weighted average interest cost is pretty attractive at 3.49%. And then in 2020, you have some higher rate debt maturing for both consolidated and JV debt. You know, with the 10 year having trended lower, do you think you'll achieve some interest rate savings on these upcoming maturities? Brian McDade : Hi, Linda. It's Brian. Yes, look, as we look out into the future and looking it through the perspective of today's current interest rate environment, certainly there would be some pickup if we stay in this environment for a longer period of time. Linda Tsai : Thanks, and then hopefully heard this correctly, the bankruptcy impact on SS NOI year-to-date was 100 bips, but then given some subsequent comments about fallout being hired, does that mean that the full-year impact on SS NOI would be greater than 200 bips? Brian McDade : Now, I think what we said to you so far, the -- Let me re-state what you just said. So there's no ambiguity. We had kept that live growth to 2%. We, generally, based on our budget would have been a little over three, had it not been from the unanticipated bankruptcies. We're still -- our goal for this year is still 2%. Linda Tsai : What's the overall impact of bankruptcies on same store for '19? Brian McDade : We just told the year-to-date, it's around 100 basis points. Linda Tsai : Okay. Thanks. Brian McDade : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. You've covered a lot. So just one for me if you don't mind, David, look, I like malls, okay. But acknowledging that sentiment on malls have been pretty poor, so far in 2019. Frankly, worse than the fundamentals, and clearly, nobody knows your business better than you guys. So when you look past '19, with 2020 and beyond fast approaching, what is the management team most excited about opportunity wise or strategically speaking? David Simon : Well, thank you, very great question. So I would say, the most exciting, the most difficult thing that we -- I mean, in terms of exciting but difficult in terms of work, and execution is the ability to redevelop our centers. And while we're doing with the fifths of the world, the North gates of the world, [indiscernible] down the line is to me, really, really exciting. I mean, yes, it's a lot of work. I'd rather have my feet up on the desk. But that's the most exciting. So, it's -- we have been constrained Derek on how to redevelop a lot of these centers, because we had to run through all these hoops with the department stores. Well, if we've got the space back, and we have their acreage, then we then the only thing constraining us is our imagination, and our ability to get permits, and obviously you got to be grounded by supply and demand. So that to me is the most exciting opportunity ahead of us is to really re-imagine the center now, you're right about the mall business sentiment. Now, Rick and I rolled it up. Rick is a little bit older to know that people have been trying got kill off the malls for clearly to be 60 years, right? So was -- with the current centers, it was the power centers, it was, Walmart, it was Amazon. It was this guy or that guy, look we're resilient. Rick and I are all like cockroaches. Okay, we're going to still hang around. So -- but I do think that doesn't mean that we've got a -- we can't keep re-imagine or places. And I would say that the most exciting. The other thing I would say to you, Derek, that is as exciting to us is because of our high-quality portfolio or high-quality balance sheet, the stability of our cash flow, even with all the turmoil going on in our, the retail world. You know, we have lots of opportunities beyond what we do today. And we evaluate those with keen interest. Derek Johnston : Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : Yes. Hi. David. You mentioned you have 77 assets that generate more than $900 to put the sale. Can you give us a sense as to what portion of your pro rata NOI those assets represent? David Simon : No, but well, I'll -- just let me think about whether I should give that word. What you might say, was that Michael, you may tell somebody a joke? Michael Mueller : No, no, I got it\u2026 David Simon : It's well over. You know, it's well over 50%, it's probably 70ish. Give or take. Michael Mueller : Got it? Okay. And then maybe push it a little further at the opposite end of the spectrum. How small is the contribution from the assets doing, say, less than 500 a foot? David Simon : I don't have those numbers at top of my head, but -- Michael Mueller : Okay. David Simon : But no worries. Michael Mueller : 70% is helpful. Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Hey, good morning everyone. I'm looking at the international properties in the total NOI bucket. And I'm seeing that that's been growing about 4% year-to-date. First question is that largely comparable? And what is driving that strength? Rick Sokolov : Well, it's largely comparable, other than there may be an expansion here or there. But remember, that's also been impacted by FX. So it's actually probably would be higher than that. You know, had we compared the last year? Most of that, most yes, the dollar has been obviously, significantly stronger, and we had budgeted to be not as strong, and it certainly year-over-year comparison stronger than where it was last year, because the vast majority of that is comfortable. So that guys have -- Wes Golladay : Would you ever consider putting that in the total bucket and maybe adjusting on the constant currency basis? Rick Sokolov : You know, I thought about it, and we should do it? Because it would demonstrate the -- I mean, the fact is, I think a lot of people forget about this diversity and the high-quality portfolio we have. By the way, the 77 assets that would average over, over 900 is not has nothing to do with our international assets. They all I'd say by and large, well over 1000 foot. So, we thought about it, but then I don't know it's just, I don't know, we decided not to but I we thought about it, we certainly generate higher comp NOI growth. And I know, others do, do that. They'd lock it in there. So maybe one day, but then you would ask what the domestic business is and we'd be back to where we are today, right? Wes Golladay : Can you keep them in the separate lines? But yes. That's why. Thank you. Rick Sokolov : Yes, no worries. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman, here with Christy. David, I wonder if you can sit back and think about the mall or the retail competitive landscape from a landlord perspective. And you talked about the turmoil and the retail industry is clearly affecting different of your peers in different ways, especially those that don't have the cost of capital or balance sheet. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about perhaps your market share of retail leasing. And whether you believe you're getting a disproportionate share of retailer store openings or a lower share of retailer store closings, given that relationship and where you stand relative to all the other mall peers? David Simon : Well, I actually don't think, Michael, that I actually, referenced to any of our peers in this call, other than to say, we do have the -- we do have some expertise that maybe others don't, when it comes to, it comes to, looking at opportunities or restructurings of retailer. So, look, I would say to you, I don't really think I referenced the peers all that much. Michael Bilerman : No, you didn't. I'm asking the question about whether you are running the company are feeling and so you're getting a disproportionate share of leasing or a lower share of closings, given retailers' desire to be in your portfolio given a lot of the others things that go along with Simon, including the balance sheet and all the other variability, are retailers more --? David Simon : Yes, no, I got the question. And I would answer it this way, and Rick can add or embellish on, I would say simply we've always -- we've kind of always had that position frankly, because of the quality of our real estate. And the fact that the quality of our real estate, the organizational strengths, and so on. So maybe on the margin it's even more important today. But I think that the stability of the organization and the quality of the real estate and the fact that people know we're going to invest in our real estate certainly helps, and certainly shouldn't' be overlooked. And I will say anecdotally, without numbers, and whatever that's worth. I mean landlords do matter. Historically maybe in a go-go time period maybe they matter less. And I'm hopeful that as retailers look at whether it's in downsizing or restructuring or growing whatever the scenario is they do take into account who their partner is. But I think we've always been in that spot, maybe it's slightly enhanced. And I do think the landlord -- the ability to invest, I mean Rick and I run around, we talk to people, they say, \"Yeah, we know you're going to take care of your properties.\" Maybe there's a few retailers that want to put in what I call \"The clause\" where that if we don't own it they can do whatever the hell they want. At least we try not to do that, but I mean we hear stuff like that. But I'd say that's kind of on the margin. Rick, please embellish. Rick Sokolov : The only other thing that I would add is that our portfolio creates a lot of profit for these retailers. They are not charitable institutions. I think they do hold us in high regards, witness our result. But the reason we have an ability to interact with our retailers in a productive way is because they make a lot of money in our properties. And when they think about their business it's in their best interest to do business with us. And that's a function of all the things that David's been talking about the entire call about reinvesting in the property, having a stable balance sheet, having all these inventive and innovative plans. It all comes down to having more productive properties. And that's what gives us, I think, an edge. Michael Bilerman : David, can you talk a little bit about sort of all the 5th platform initiatives. You've obviously had the outlet online business you've done at eSports, the CBD shops, there's a lot of other little bets you're placing in a lot of different ways. I guess how should we think about how you're spending your time on all of those initiatives? And how should we think about the capital that you may put forth to additional programs to drive [indiscernible] assets? David Simon : Well, I think you'll see more and more of it, Michael, and can't really quantify it because it is opportunistic. But look, all of this is kind of return based. I mean it's not money that we're willy-nilly just throwing there hoping it sticks, it's not spaghetti up against the wall. But I do think we're going to be as creative and as innovative as we possibly can be with the guardrails that we have historically used, which is making sure that's a good return on investment, making sure that it's synergistic to what we do, making sure that we're betting on the right people and the right product and the right vision. But you will absolutely see more from us in this area. And I'm hoping from that what -- we've been fighting the fight for years that we're more than a mall company. We've always defined ourselves as a retail real estate company from the get-go. Even when we went public we were more than a mall company. We have morphed into retail real estate, we've morphed into outlets, we've morphed into the Mills, we've morphed into international. So we are densifying our business in terms of -- so I am hopeful that with time, even though we are categorized as a mall company. Again, I'm not running from the mall business here. As someone asked earlier, what one of our most exciting things we have is redeveloping all this anchor space. But we are much different than that. And that process and evolution will continue. And we're hopeful that we will be profitable in it like we have in our other ventures out of our traditional business. Not our core business, our traditional business. Michael Bilerman : This one, sort of strategically, as part of when you spun off WPG, which in hindsight I think those assets clearly would have been a little bit more of an anchor to your growth. You did spin off the open-air shopping center business. I guess as being a retail landlord does that business and the potential to maybe re-aggregate in that space or that's not on the table at all? David Simon : I don't think it's on the table. If I understood the question I don't think it's on the table. I think there's a lot of opportunities ahead of us, I just wouldn't rank that as high up there. Michael Bilerman : And then how does the U.K. which is obviously going through -- the stocks there are obviously having a lot of difficulties given their leverage position. You had Queretaro try to do something. Does that rank high on your list? David Simon : I'm more worried about my -- the season is about to start for my team Crystal Palace. I'm more worried about it. And I have another -- I want a solid year this year. I'm tired of watching the relegation fight. So I'm more worried about that right now. Michael Bilerman : All right, thanks for the time, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. David Simon. David Simon : Okay, thank you and have a great rest of your summer. And we'll talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR Website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Okay. Good morning. We had a very busy and productive quarter, and very pleased with our financial results. Results of the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $1.081 billion, or $3.05 per share. We achieved this consensus this quarter even with certain unanticipated retail of bankruptcies, reduced property level NOI from the acceleration of properties undergoing significant redevelopment such as Northgate compared to our budgets. Reduced overage rents from tourism spending, including the negative impact from the continued strong U.S. dollar and lower distribution income from certain international investments. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Comp NOI increased 1.6% for the third quarter and total portfolio increased 1.3% for the quarter. Portfolio NOI was negatively impacted by 50 basis points due to properties undergoing significant redevelopment and the unfavorable FX impact due to the continuing strong dollar. Year-to-date comp NOI has increased 1.7%. Retail bankruptcies negatively impacted our comp NOI by over 100 basis points in the third quarter. As a reminder, our Japan Premium Outlets and designer outlets in Europe produce over $1000 in retail sales per square foot, and all of our 26 international outlets excluding Canada, which is in our basically North American portfolio generated comp NOI growth of 6.3% on a constant currency basis, which as a reminder is not included in our comp NOI, and if you did that, we'd be well over 2%. Retail sales momentum accelerated in the third quarter. Reported retail sales per square foot for malls and outlets was $680 compared to $650 per foot, an increase of 4.5%. Leasing activity remains solid, average base minimal rent was $54.55. The malls and Premium Outlets recorded leasing spread of $12.10, an increase of 22.2%. Our malls and outlets occupancy end of the quarter, 94.7% an increase of 30 basis points compared to occupancy at the end of the second quarter. And again, tenant bankruptcies affected that by roughly 60 basis points. On an NOI weighted basis, excluding our international outlets, which I discussed above, we reported were as follows. Reported retailer sales on an NOI weighted basis is $867 compared to $680 per foot. NOI weighted sales growth was 6.1% year-over-year compared to 4.5%. As mentioned, occupancy is 95.8% compared to 94%. Average base minimum rent is $73.14 compared to the $54.55 number and our weighted comp NOI growth would be 2.7%. We started construction on new Premium Outlet in Tulsa, Oklahoma scheduled to open in the spring of 2021. Construction continues on four other new international outlet developments, Malaga, Spain, Bangkok, Thailand, West Midlands England, and not to forget Normandy, France, which we expect to be a terrific new outlet center. We had a very busy quarter in terms of completion of redevelopment projects, in particular, expansions on several of our high performing international outlets. We opened -- including two in South Korea and one in Vancouver out -- Vancouver designer outlet in Canada. During the quarter, we started construction on our significant redevelopment at Tacoma mall. And at the end of the third quarter, we have 30 properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally with the share of the net costs of approximately $1.4 billion. And as a reminder, this is being funded by our internally generated cash flow. We announced and as you are aware, we closed on our new venture with the Rue Gilt Group to combine our shop premium outlets marketplace with RGG\u2019s highly successful Rue La La and Gilt creating a new multi-platform dedicated to digital value shopping. We're very excited to expand our omnichannel capabilities in partnership with our RGG, which is a very profitable company with significant sales. Our industry leading capabilities in the physical outlet space combined with RGG\u2019s exceptional e-commerce success will give shoppers and enhance access to the world's best brands and most compelling deals, both online and in-store. You saw the announcement this week regarding strategic investments. I won't belabor that other than we're very excited about the transactions that we're investing in Lifetime, Fitness, Pin Stripes, SOHO, PARM, Sports Illustrated, Allied esports. You can now for those of you that really like gaming, please enter the Simon cup. We encourage you to do so. You'll have a lot of fun, but I will not be funding the analyst, it's in fact one of you win. Look for us to open Sports Illustrated, Sports Gaming Restaurants in the future. So now balance sheet. We completed three tranche senior notes, totaling $3.5 billion at the coupon rate of 2.61%, average weighted turns of 15.9 years are offering marked industry milestones prior to our issuance no real estate company had ever issued 1.25 billion of 30-year bonds in a single issuance, and the interest rate for each of the tranches was the lowest achieved by any real estate company for similar notes. We in October completed our four early redemptions of our senior notes, totaling $2.6 billion and during the quarter, we repurchased one point 1 15 million shares. After the bond redemptions, our liquidity stands at 7 billion, balance sheet\u2019s in great shape. We announced a dividend of $2.10 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year. We\u2019ll pay $8.30 per share in dividends in 2019. That's an increase of 5.1% compared to all of last year. We've grown the dividend more than 8% over the last few years. And as a reminder, our annualized dividend yield is greater than 5% which is more than 350 basis points higher than the 10-year Treasury which is it at basically at a record spread were more than 1.5 times covered in terms of our dividend coverage by our FFO, and we've paid out since we've been public now well over $30 billion, a lot of dough. Now just to update finally. Guidance is $12 to $12.05, which is an increase of $0.03 from the bottom end of the range after giving effect to the $0.33 debt extinguishment charge as we outlined for you when we did our notes deal a month or so ago. So that's it. We're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Oh great. Thank you. I just wanted to touch a little bit. I mean you've been very active in terms of developing your experience for tenants for your assets. And I just wonder, how high could you be taking this penetration in the next say two or three years? David Simon : Well I would say to you the level of interest and new retailers in this category continues to amaze us. They actually are very interested in our real estate. So despite the negative narrative that you see from the general media, they all want to locate in the mall, and in our real estate, and I think we're just at the beginning of that. So I continue to expect us to redevelop our assets with those kind of retailers significantly over the next decade. Craig Schmidt : Yes I was just thinking about the Southdale where you replacing a appendix with the lifetime assets. What kind of lift could that give to that center? David Simon : Significant. I mean, they -- they'll have 5000 members. They're great for the community. They are without question the best operator of a lifetime resort. In that whole industry they blow everybody away. They're great partners, good friends. And we expect continued growth there. They reinforce our real estate as a place for the community. And I couldn't be prouder working with them side by side and as partners. They also have. They also have a world class shareholder base. So that's as we create kind of the next generation of our company. We're associating ourselves with world class entrepreneurs, partners, investors. We could sit here and talk about selling an outlet for a million dollars, but I encourage you to think about our company differently. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And just lastly, I know we've touched on this. You're saying that human resources and permits are probably more of a generator than your access to capital. But then are you thinking you might have to accelerate some of your capital spend in the next few years, just given the redovs and developments you're doing, and you seem to continue to be on pace for whether it's the new developments and in the European outlets etcetera. David Simon : I think, it's going to be relatively you know within you know margin of error relatively consistent with what we've been doing the last couple of years, correct. So we're spending a billion to a billion and a half per year, that's not going to jump up to two and a half billion just because of what I would you know because of some of the constraints that we have. Not financially, but just you know execution. So I would expect us to continue to be in that range over the next few years. Craig Schmidt : Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks. David Simon : Yes sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : Hey it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here for Christy. David because you know I just picked up our gold cards, but I don't think we're going to win. Our kids probably have a better chance of doing that than we do. David Simon : Again, I would, get one of your kids to enter it and then they may have a better shot than you Michael. Michael Bilerman : Exactly. If you think about all these investments that you're making, a lot of the consumer facing brands and you talked a little bit about you went through the list on the call. You know as reported in the press, the full House, SOHO House one was about a$100 million. How should we think about the totality of capital that you have out today across all of these different investments? If you look at the balance sheet, I'm not sure if it's in the other assets category, but if it is, that that totality is gone from 1.2 billion up to 1.8 over the course of the nine months. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of the total money that you've put out across all of these different exciting adventures? David Simon : Yes, First of all, just to clarify the increase in the other assets is basically because writing up the leases to value. I mean that's the biggest because of the new accounting rules. That's the biggest change. Okay, so you can't go from that number to what we've invested by any stretch of imagination. So that's number one. Number two is to the extent that we reach materiality. We're obviously going to have to disclose that in our financial statements in our Q and our K. So the other assets is just so you know is basically the increase in those -- for what. And it's, driving up and that's $525 million roughly when you have to write up your leases to market with the new accounting rules. Okay. So we have not reached the, I would say it this way, we certainly have not reached our investment, our outside investments to the level of materiality. That's the first point. Second is I look at it, our embedded, and we basically reinvesting our embedded gains that we have in Aero in ABG and some of the other Venture Group investments into some of these things. So right now we're playing with the houses money and it's not material. I don't think the SOHO House number is right. So, just I'm not going to go through each one at each level, again I encourage everybody try to think about us a little bit differently, but what we're doing is we're making these investments to learn. So that we're going to be number one a better company. Two is creating investments with great partners, with great entrepreneurs, with great shareholders, I think is going to exponentially increase our opportunities both in our physical and ultimately in the online world. And the level of activity that we are seeing it's just very encouraging is all I can tell you, I mean I think where we're at the epicenter of kind of physical online world, Entertainment creating kind of the next generation destination center and it's, we're all trying to put it together, but we're not. At this point simple thing to think about is make sure you understand, you know that on the deferred assets. Number one. Number two is make sure you understand we're not at the materiality level. And number three is, it's basically we're rolling the embedded gains. The way I think about it as our role in the embedded gains in our future investments. But we're also making these not as a learning experience because who cares about learning. We're doing it to make money and I expect all of these to pay off in the future. Michael Bilerman : David, you've obviously been critical to the company's success for well over 25 years. You signed your last retention employment agreement back in 2011 that expired back in July. Where do things stand in terms of you going without an employment agreement at this point, or is that still being worked on? David Simon : I have no employment agreement. Michael Bilerman : So you'll just be an employee at will, with everybody else. David Simon : That's the way it's shaping up. Yes, that\u2019s the answer. Michael Bilerman : Christy has a question too. Christy McElroy : Hey David, good morning. You mentioned the 100 basis point impact I think to comp NOI from bankruptcies in Q3. Just to try to get a sense for the impacts that have already incurred been incurred in Q3, versus what could be incremental in Q4. Just with regard to the Forever 21 bankruptcy filing, was there any reserve in the revenue line and impact to same store for non-payment of prepetition rent? And have you seen any impact thus far from Barneys or Kitchen Collection at this point? David Simon : Not at this point. I mean, we don't really go through each and every retailer. I don't think it's fair given the size of our company for us to talk about specific retailers. I want to differ on that. But the reality is we have these we've updated our guidance, we've narrowed the range and all of that kind of embedded in that. So you know, I think the important point is, a number of these were unanticipated from our budget, we told you what our budget was at the beginning of the year. We don't update our comp NOI as you know. And we would have well outperformed it. We still, you know, the biggest variable, we've got right now is still the overage rent in our tourist centers. And we'll see how the fourth quarter shakes out to me that's the bigger variable than anything else, but all of kind of all of the noise that is out there from certain retailers is kind of embedded in our guidance for the year. Christy McElroy : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I guess David, maybe you or Rick could just talk about sort of the leasing pipeline and the momentum and as you think about 2020 and kind of where you sit in terms of leasing for next year and just the tenant demand. How would you sort of describe the environment today versus say a year ago, and how do you sort of feel like you're shaping up on 2020 expirations? Rick Sokolov : Steve, it\u2019s Rick. In fact, David and I have just slogged through twelve hour days going property by property, and frankly the environment is still strong. There are a lot of tenants that want to access our properties across all three platforms. We are doing a whole lot of leasing. So far this year, we've got almost 10 and a half million square feet. You see our rents are up. Our spreads are up, and in a lot of instances spaces that we're getting back, we're putting in more productive tenants at higher rents. David Simon : I would just say look, next year -- I think -- we obviously you know it does take time. We did where we are having a high bankruptcy year. I mean, there's no denying that. I mean you know I mean it were so, but as we put together our plan for next year, I think we'll be -- I think we'll be okay. And we're hustling. We're finding new tenants. The biggest setback that I see for next year is not so much replacing the bankruptcy, but really getting our redevelopment pipe open. We've got it. We have taken a step back this year, a reasonable level of cash flow. Forget whether it's comp or whatever, however, you want to describe it.  But we've taken a reasonable step back this year because of taking down properties to redevelop, and you know and we are -- we are never a company that does. I've seen so many companies throw away the year and say, well we'll get back to 2021, we'll get back in 2022 we do not do that. So the reality is, we're going to come in with comp NOI that\u2019s going to be not so bad, it\u2019s a little variable as I have described repeatedly, with our you know the tourism slowdown, which you know we pointed out six month \u2013 three, six months ago, and now you see it across the board for both retailers and companies that are -- had exposure to tourism and the strong dollar. But we are still going to deliver comp NOI growth that's not going to be that, you know is one of my heroes would say not too shabby. Next year, we've got a lot of \u2013 we don't give guidance until as you know end of January. I think it'll be fine even with, even with the bankruptcies that we've got to lease up, and the fact that we're still in a massive redevelopment number. And that stuff the redevelopment takes time, and we are in that we are in that business. We're not in that -- but we don't have throwaway years, Steve you know that about us. Steve Sakwa : No. Look I appreciate that. I guess again, not I guess trying to delve a little bit onto the redevelopment and just thinking about sort of next year and some of the headwinds you're taking down Northgate this year, I mean, do you sort of think about, I guess those types of projects that have negatively impacted. Do you expect those to continue? Number one. And then as you just sort of think about the list of bankruptcies this year, and you sort of think about possibilities for next year. Does the list of potential bankruptcies next year look a lot smaller than maybe it did a year ago? David Simon : No, I think -- listen, I think we're flushing through most of the dues. Okay. So, I actually think you know now who knows, I mean but I think we're kind of reaching bottom and 18 on that stuff or 19 on that stuff. It's rivaling what happened in 17. So it's not like something that we haven't experienced before. But we know what we have to do, and again, I don't want to get ahead of our guidance, but I don't think, I don't think you're not going to see a dramatic, Oh my God from us. Okay, when we present our plan. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning. Your third quarter same-store NOI growth of up 1.6% seems like it's the best in the mall sector, so I was just wondering if you guys could go through any thoughts you have on how you're able to differentiate yourself on a scale helping the mix of property types or something else? David Simon : Well, I mean I think it's not. If you look over a long period of time, I mean, I think we've done that for a number of years. So I don't really. I don't know, I mean it's a function. We have good people, good assets with diversified not tied in one particular regional place. And again I just want to know the fact of the matters that we put in our international business, which we really don't have. We thought we're thinking about it, but we don't want to confuse people. So, I mean we'd be well over 2% comp NOI growth. And don't forget about our international business, its 26 assets again exclude Canada because we have put Canada in our premium outlet business from the get-go. So I don't know I just, you know, it's, we're focused on the business and running the day to day, the best that we can. So I don't really want to compare contrast. But I think it's not, it's not, this isn't like a first quarter, this isn't the first time we've done that, I guess is what I want to say, right Rick?. Rick Sokolov : Exactly. Listen, we grind every nickel everybody pays attention to every aspect of our business. On the income side and the expense side, and we've been doing it for a very long time, very consistently and we intend to continue to do it. David Simon : Yes, I can give you here is the culture. So we go through every asset while we're planning, we were here till 9 o'clock last night. We're not sitting here, planning, how we're going to communicate. Maybe we should because sometimes we garble the message. While all the time, maybe. So we've been in the last two days going through, this is we're going through our mall portfolio today than next week we go through the international business and each category have offered Bilerman to come here and see it. But Ward telling me not to do that again. But the reality is we are doing that nine. We did it all day Monday to nine. We do it all day today, we're right after this call. We're doing it. There is no downtime. We're not planning how to communicate what we're doing, we're just doing and that's the culture.. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then I was wondering, maybe if you guys could talk about the new outlet in Oklahoma that you're working on. Just what pre-leasing has been like, and what other retail options kind of are in the area? David Simon : Well we have a very good mall there. It is the -- you know I mean not not to dwell too much on demographics, but it's the largest trade area without a without an outlet center. And we've been working on it for a while and you know based on our success in Denver and tenant demand, we feel extremely confident we're going to be able to liberate for a good return in a -- in a very good market. I mean Tulsa is a very good market with good income demographics, and I think it's kind of a. It's really our bread and butter. We don't honestly, if we have to pre lease, we're not the kind of company we need to be. So we don't really pre lease so to speak, but we're very confident then that we'll be able to deliver the product that we want to deliver. Caitlin Burrows : Okay,thanks. David Simon : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Simon : Hey, good morning. Jeremy Metz : David, just wanted to go back to Michael's question a little bit on the Simon Ventures and some of these other investments you made, and just hoping you can expand upon your last comment in response to the hedges, in terms of how do you really think about measure returns for some of these, just given some clear tangential benefits are you obviously looking to pull from doing this? David Simon : Well, just to be clear. We expect these returns to be similar to what private equity type returns and they must stand on their own, but we're making them because we think there is potential to do business with that partner. So there are two separate decisions. One is, for instance in lifetime it's very simple, we looked at a multiple of EBITDA. We looked at their growth. We looked at their future. And we're very confident that we're going to get a multiple of our invested capital. And all by the way, there are wonderful partners and we're going do arm's length business with them going forward. And to me that is a perfect scenario of a win-win. So the investments must stand on their own. They must be and we look at them through a private equity lens much like everything else we've done. At the same time, if we can do business with them on an arm's length basis that's the gravy. And that's basically how we look at it and again. And we expect that we, by the way we've. Yeah, we've had some write-offs in our venture group which is a little. That venture groups, a little more at the early days of investing. Not in a round not kind of either BC round, BC or even DRAM. But the ones that I've announced here this week are ones that are basically well-established companies. So that's -- this is in many cases growth capital or just solidifying our relationship and we think it's a good investment. And again these aren't at the point of materiality. Again I want everybody to put the size of our company in perspective, but we are going to make money on those investments, number one. Number two is, we're going to learn a lot because a number of these companies are leaders are in their industry, and we're not too old. Rick and I were close. But we're not too old to learn. And I mean not to diverge and we were up at the RGG Board meeting last Thursday or Friday. I can't remember, but I mean the amount that we are going to learn, and in addition to the opportunities that we had as a partnership going forward. But the amount, we're going to be a better real estate operator, and this is what I need everyone to try and appreciate. We are going to be a better real estate operator. The more we know e-commerce, okay and the more we know how they integrate. And have been partners with one of the best entrepreneurs, frankly ever in the e-commerce space, one of the early pioneers in that team. I mean just separates I think ultimately what we're going to be able to do. And again, I can't -- I can't say it's going to mean, and it's and it's a profitable company and they do several hundred million dollars of sales and all this other stuff, but and we wouldn't have done it had we not felt like the company was worth it. But the reality is, we're going to. And it's going to accelerate our marketplace efforts, and we're going to be better in the real estate, we're going to be -- we're going to make money in that investment, but we're also going to be better real estate operators, because of that investment. And we're going to know our retailers better, and we do already. But this is going to take us to another hopefully to another level. And that's -- that you know in technology and how you integrate it with the physical properties, and all you know and with our retailers, I think it's going to be very very interesting to see how it all evolves. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Great, thank you for that. And just a follow up I have is just on the densification projects. You remove the disclosure from the sub but regardless, you obviously have a number of projects going on that are going to deliver here and have been 2019 but really next year and beyond. I just wondering if you could talk about the pipeline, what's the total dollars at a gross cost basis today that have under way. And I guess what's beyond, what was last disclosed I guess last quarter. How much additional opportunities are you working on currently given some of the other need here for capital and it's a bit of a different skill sets, I'm assuming there is a human capacity to how much you can really have going on at any one point along these will that. David Simon : Yes, Don't read anything into the fact that we took that out. So here's why we took it out and we can put it back in. Number one, if you are under construction, and we have approved it's in our detail, its i.e. it's already in the detail. That's number one. Number two is, we are also outlining other stuff that's being done on the peripheral of our properties that we aren't doing that I thought was. I didn't want to mislead the market, somehow, even though [Indiscernible] that it wasn't our projects. So we took that out. And three is the pipeline is so big, we weren't having, we weren't doing the right discipline of, you know what's in there, because it is a, big pipeline. So we just felt like it's probably better to communicate it when it's been approved. So the pipeline is actually, I didn't want to just lift like we'll be at schedule that says, here's all the densification we're going to do. I'd rather just put it in the 8-K when we actually are doing it. That's the nature of our company as opposed to outlining potential stuff. So the pipeline is continues to be very big Northgate. The Northgate continues to evolve. It's a $1 billion project you know with office, residential, all sorts of mixed-use stuff. So you know we have the Houston Galleria development again that could have been on a pipe, but we're not quite ready to start construction. So you'll continue to see what's the number over $2 billion to $3 billion. If I had that we had put a number on it, but we'll, I think we'll just, it is so much ingrained in our business now. There is no reason to separate it. It's just part of our 8-K that you'll see as we approve deals. So I look at it as an evolution or sophistication in our ability to execute. So it's just part of our portfolio as opposed to this is a separate distinct schedule. Doesn't need to be anymore because it just part of the nature of what we do. Jeremy Metz : Got it. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning out there. So two -- two questions. First\u2026 David Simon : Alex, why do you say good morning after all the time? You think we\u2019re that far out there? Alexander Goldfarb : Well I -- you know I, it's just a standard hello greeting. So anyway now you're asking me to think on my feet, which is tough. I said sorry about the questions. First, on the debt side, obviously you had strong demand on your unsecured bonds, you priced pretty tight the Apple. But maybe, you can just talk about what's going on in the mortgage market. You know some of the folks that we've spoken to have said, you know the lenders are either pulling back, or trying to pare exposure or tightening terms, lowering LTVs. I mean, we all saw you know the LTV and the underwriting for the Norwalk SoNo mall. So maybe you can just give a sense of what's going on the mortgage side of the business, and whether it's by asset type, is it across the board or is it certain productivity levels you know of malls etcetera just a bit more color on there? Brian McDade : Good morning, Alex. It\u2019s Brian. So look I think from the mortgage perspective, this year has been a relatively light year from a maturity profile perspective, but we're much more active next year. We are already in the market on some of those assets, and are receiving solid indications back in line with what our expectations are. Look I think, at the end of the day we're not seeing any reduction in appetite, but certainly that's a function of our asset quality. And so, we expect that market is going to be there. I understand that there's a few deals that are out there now, that will get priced here in the next six to eight weeks, which will further drive down price discovery in that marketplace. David Simon : Yes. And look I think, we would we reaffirm Brian's points, but also just add a couple of things. Number one is sponsorship in and again that said, I'm not reflecting any other deals that are out there, but sponsorship isn\u2019t the case for everybody. Sponsorship is critically important. That's number one. And the balance sheet and that's what's great about where we stand is that, we don't -- we can do all sorts of different financings. We're not tied to the secured market or the unsecured market. And that again is a material separator, which I mean we didn't harp on it again today because you know when Tom says this first thing, he usually puts it in. I'm like -- I think people are tired of talking about it. So, but I would think that and the proof is always in the pudding, which the pudding was pretty damn good a month ago, okay. So the reality is we do have this separator in our real estate peer group, because we have the ability to go in and out of the markets pretty effectively, whether secured unsecured etcetera. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question is on all the new investing you're doing the Sports Illustrated whether not you do Forever 21. All these things as you underwrite them how is your tolerance for sort of the time to get to cash flow positive. Is it the same as you would underwrite for real estate meaning or do these projects take longer or do you allow yourself more to let these things go before you decide ultimately to just kick the venture out and move on to the next. Just curious how you're underwriting is different in the time it takes to profitability versus the non-traditional retail ventures versus traditional retail real estate? David Simon : Well, I think it really depends on the category and what the, -- I mean the reality is, all these companies have comparable. So some case there are valued at 5 times cash flow. In some cases they're value to 20 times cash flow. And it's really a function of what we see in the future and where the market is. So we don't really get ahead of ourselves, one way or another on that. And then like I said, I think we look at it similar to what you know with respect to Simon Venture Group, what kind of the venture people look at it, we look at it with the same lens and in the private equity, I think we do the same thing. And again, we have this extra soft in the sense that we're expecting to get other benefits out of it, which are not necessarily in our numbers, but which is important to us. And I don't want to talk about retailers specifically and, but we are not. It just so everyone, it's clear we're not involved in the one retailer, you mentioned about investing or doing anything on that front. I mean I think it got mischaracterize. Last call, so I just want to be clear on that, we're not involved in any retailer that is in BK in terms of us looking to invest. So just to be clear on that. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thank you David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Rich Hill : Hey, David. So look, I think the reason that you're differentiating yourself is you're playing a lot more offense than maybe some of your peers who are playing defense. So with that in mind, I have, I have one question and one follow up to that. Look 7% to 8% development yields to quote you not too shabby in this world backdrop of slow growth and low rates. Are you seeing, maybe even more demand from sovereign wealth funds, other foreign investors to maybe partner with you on your developments with an eye on the long term? David Simon : Well look, I think it's a really good question, Rich. And you know it's funny. Most of those folks I've got to be careful here, so I don't know. I don't mean to you know, I mean right now let's face it. We're a contrarian investment, okay. If you look at our multiple compared the kind of most of the other non-retail real estate confidence, and if you look at cash flow stability or multiples or however you want to slice and dice it, we're you know in today's world we're contrary. And there are not frankly a lot of contrarian investors, there's more herd mentality. There are some very sophisticated sovereign wealth\u2019s that would love to partner with us on new opportunities. And again, when I say new opportunities, you know existing, existing, existing real estate that they may have and they want someone like us to do that. We're starting those discussions very, very early early early days just to get to know them. But the reality is not a lot of contrary investment and for whatever reason we are considered a contrarian, but you do make a good point. We're on the offense, and the fact that matters, we've been so busy and excited about the both the redevelopment, the densification and some of the new ventures that we've had, that that's that's perfectly fine for us, so we're going to continue to run the business. So I do think at some point there's a -- there's that there will be a swap back to reality. But you know those kind of investors would rather buy certain assets types that are three and a half yield. I won't name names as opposed to you know six plus and Class A regional malls. That's been historically a bad debt overtime. And you know who am I to say, I'm smarter than those other guys. But listen, I'm willing to -- I'm willing to play the game and see who's right in the long run. Rich Hill : Got it. And so, one follow up question to that. You look at \u2013 you have a tremendous amount of free cash flow that you're spinning off, or a super strong balance sheet. Why wouldn't you just ramp up CapEx as a percentage of your operating cash flow right now, and spend even more money to redevelop your properties for the future and how -- I guess, I guess the question I'm ultimately asking is, you'd said CapEx is going to be relatively range bound. Why wouldn't you play even more offense than what you're playing right now? David Simon : Well it goes back to a little you know. I mean, it is literally some of the big projects we have. We're still constrained by getting approvals. So we have two or three big ones that are in the approval process, just to name three that jump out at me. Brea, Orange County, Stoneridge which is in the East Bay Area of California, King of Prussia. So you know we -- we don't have the approvals yet to start. That's the biggest limiter. And you know I don't. On the -- and then we are building office and the reality is, we don't. That's the one area, we're not going to build speck on. I mean, we're depending on the side. We're going to want some lead tenants. We're not -- we're not foolish. So but we think we have really good product that\u2019s differentiated in the markets that we're contemplating it. But getting the lead tenant, does take a little bit of time. So I think we're -- you know we're pretty aggressive, but you know and Northgate, it's a great example. I think Northgate, we could have been a little more methodical, we had it. Just to give you a -- you know it depresses me a little bit. But just to give you an order of magnitude, we had roughly we had in that in our numbers this year to do about 15 million of NOI. And it's going to do five, roughly. Yes I get five. Come on, I know these numbers. And that's because we accelerated, we basically decided let's just get on with our lives and tear them all down. Okay. Happy to be out there when the mall is coming down believe it or not. So we are doing it. It's just I think we're moving pretty fast in some of these areas. We're not going to be you know if we are building office, we're not going to get over. I mean, it's 100,000 square foot QDC [ph] building that's one thing, but we're not going to get over our skis too much on some of the stuff to make sure we're in good shape. Rich Hill : Got it. That's helpful David. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nick Yulico : Good morning. Sorry if I missed this. But could we just get the bankruptcy impact on same-store NOI growth this quarter? I think, it was cited as about a 100 basis points in the first two quarters this year? David Simon : It's a 100 year-to-date and it was 60 roughly 60 in this quarter, correct or not? Brian McDade : A 100 for the quarter. David Simon : 100 for the quarter, I\u2019m sorry. 100 for the quarter. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks, and then second question is just going back to Forever 21, we looked at the bankruptcy filing for them. You only have one existing store on the store closure list. That rose about feel, this -- it excludes all the stores in development, which will not be opening. So I guess, that store closure was -- I mean, should that give us comfort. There is one store in there? Or should we be expecting that over your 98 stores with them, either you already gave rent release or you're planning to over the next year? David Simon : I guess, I don't. We don't want to talk about specific retailers. Well I think, there we\u2019ll have to see how that. That that bankruptcy evolves. I mean, there are more stores that they rejected that or about to reject that they never opened in. Again, I don't want to get into the nitty, gritty detail, but in that particular case you brought it up. It was Riley Rose. We had a handful of those that at least is executed that won't be open. So whether you know they weren't in our initial numbers in any of them. So you'll see some of those come out one way or another, but it's never been an arts until they open, it's not in our not in our document I guess or 8-K. But we'll see how it goes. I mean, I can't -- I can't, I'm not you know and I want to be very careful here, so I'm not involved in it. We're \u2013 we\u2019re negotiating kind of the future like every other major landlord and we'll see how it all shapes out at the end of the day. Nick Yulico : Okay. And I hate -- I guess, I'm just trying to tie it back to the bankruptcy impact year-to-date. It was 100 basis points. I'm assuming there was not much in that from Forever 21, unless you've already renegotiated leases. And it's almost 1.5% of your base rent. So as we look forward over the next year, it's kind of feels like that bankruptcy impact to Forever 21 by itself could be similar to your overall bankruptcy impact this year. Is that fair? David Simon : Well I think you'll see a bigger, what we'll know more in 2020. It's not going to be material in 2019. And I think the focus is going to be really 2020, what that that group is able to do going forward, which is out of our hands, and we're going to have to wait and see. We'll have a \u2013 again, I don't want to get into particular tenants, but we'll have that, that's our view of what happens with that, and other bankrupt tenants will ultimately be in our 2020 estimates. And that's the way for us to look at it. At this point, the materiality of any of these guys and in the next year end is not in my opinion going to be material. Nick Yulico : Okay. All right. Thank you. David Simon : For you, it might be once that might be what, I know, okay. But it's -- we did update our guidance and what we know today about the bankrupt tenants is in our guidance. And that's the important thing. And then our view of you know some of these bankrupt tenants and what their plan is for 2020 will be in our 2020 guidance. And that's the best way I can answer that. Nick Yulico : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi. Just following up on what you were just talking about. So with some of these bankruptcies having been unexpected in 2019, as you look out to 2020, do you think a base case of 2% NOI [ph] growth would still be achievable? David Simon : We give our guidance at the end of January. Do we have a date yet? Not yet. We get word -- we're waiting to see if the Colts make the Super Bowl, because we want to -- we want to make. We want to. We want to work it around that day, around that day. That was a joke, but no, no I actually think they're a pretty good team. But where we give that all of that will be reflected in, and we've never given 2020 guidance, and you know I mean people have estimates all over the place. So I don't, I don't really opine on a one way or another. Linda Tsai : Okay. And then, in terms of SPO.com How are you and Michael Rubin thinking about its value proposition. You know how much crossover would the product you provide online through SPO.com is available through other online distribution channels? And then, do you have any sense of the price differential on SPO.com and how it might compare with other discounters like Ross or T.J? David Simon : Yes, look this is a complicated -- that's a complicated question, and I think, I think the important thing is, we both think and not just us, but you know our SPO team and the existing RGG team couldn't be more excited about the future opportunities together that we have. I think their team is unquestionably excited. I would not. You know, I think it's going to be a great partnership for our company and together, we're going to do a lot more both in terms of growing their existing business and then the partnership taking the origins of our business and extrapolating that going forward. But it is early days. We're very committed to making this exciting, and between all of our relationships with the brands, and all of our physical attributes and their e-commerce attributes. Now this could be a really really significant opportunity for our partnership. So let's give it a little bit of time. I can't give you an exact roadmap, because some of this stuff we'd like to keep to ourselves, because we are -- we are still growing the business and there's a lot of competition out there on that front. So, but again, couldn't be, couldn't be more pleased with the potential opportunity in the future. Linda Tsai : Thanks for that. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. So you're -- you\u2019ve been reporting improving sales per square foot for the past several years, but that formula there's some noise to it because the denominator is always changing. So I was wondering if you had a sense of the total sales productivity on at your centers over the past couple of years. Just try and get a sense of if it's becoming more vibrant or somewhat static overtime. And I realize that hotels and apartments you can't because there's no sales data for it, but just try and get a bigger picture. David Simon : You know, I will give you the benefit of rule of large numbers. There is absolutely given our large portfolio. There is absolutely your comment about the denominator changing, is there a relevant in terms of our results. Because one particular property going in one particular property going out or 10 going in or 10 going out aunt going to move the number my friend. So that's number one. Number two is many cases in our new developments; they come in below our average. And with that said, if anything, its understanding it. And then finally, I'll say, we continue to believe that we're reporting and this is really important and I've said it again, I want to keep saying it, but we're getting the you what's reported to us. And in some cases, what are reported to us is not actually gross sales. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. I'm just going back to the topic of your investments that you're making and in places like RGG or Authentic Brands. Is it easy to get the sense that you're focused on making your fleet better and adding on different types of opportunities like private equity or venture capital. When does it start to become more interesting to actually increasing your fleet size or is it the case that the upside opportunity and redevelopment and private equity type of investments is still just far greater and better opportunity then increase in the fleet size? David Simon : Did you say fleet? Ki Bin Kim : Yes, sort of mall counts, retail center counts, things like that. David Simon : Okay, well, look, I think we've historically have been acquisitive over our career. We just haven't done anything in a while. But the fact of the matter is if we have so much going on in so many opportunities here feel pretty good. I mean I don't feel like we need to do that, but if there's something out there that's makes sense. We would look at it. But I think its business as usual for us and the focus being on, it sounds like gobbledygook. But the focus is just making us a better company, we got plenty of assets. And all of these things that we are doing and attempting to do is to make the real estate in our company better. But we are more than a real estate company and that we interface with brands and consumers to an unbelievable extent. So why that takes advantage of that reach that we've done reasonably well. But we can certainly do it too much greater extent and that continues to be a focus for us. Ki Bin Kim : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Vince Tibone : Could you elaborate on the magnitude of the decline in international tourism, and the impact that had on foot traffic in tenant tailed some of your key gateway market properties? David Simon : Well, we don't give out specifics on that. But I mean, put it this way, the business has been, the tourist centers have been relatively flat in terms of sales, and we think had we had a normal you know if we had a normal, what I'd call a normal dollar in terms of the strength versus vis-\u00e0-vis the euro and other currencies and you know and all the other noise that's out there, we would have expected at 5%, 6% increase. So I don't know if that means, I don't know if that gives you kind of what you want, but it's you know that some of our bigger international property sales have been flat. And traffic's actually not been too much the problem. It's been stable, but it's really we're seeing the flatness of the sales that we would expect it. When we did budget, we would have expected to have a 5 or so percent increase in sales. Vince Tibone : Interesting, but that's helpful color. And then just one more for me and maybe switching gears a little, can you provide some color on the trends you're seeing in the private market for malls. I mean, do you think cap rates or the number of interested bidders has changed over the last six months or so? David Simon : I would say to you that, I have not seen a change, but I would think that, I have not really seen a tangible change. I still think you know investing is more or less a herd mentality. And we're you know I was going to give an animal analogy, but I better refrain. Last time I did cockroach, which I -- I'm not going to do today, but I think people steal, the guys that have the money you know I think they, they they've always been retail real estate's always been you know it's not -- it's not a commodity, so the operator really matters so to speak. So it's not like a warehouse that's like you know one commodity versus the next. And so do the operators matter, and the money that kind of goes in and out a commodity real estate as you know it's always kind of ebbs and flows for retail real estate, because who the operator is always been materially important. So that's, that's one aspect I'd say to you. The next is, I still think they're surprisingly I'm actually surprised about it. But the so-called smart money has not played a big role in this. But, I mean they obviously have different points of view and they may be right. But we feel pretty good about what we're doing. Vince Tibone : That's helpful. And just one follow up on that. I mean, let's say the herd mentality does push cap rates higher. Is there a point where you would potentially come in and be an acquirer of single assets on the market? Given to your point that the platform makes a big difference and you could probably increase in a line from these acquisitions. David Simon : Yes. I think if there was a good fit, we would certainly take a -- take a hard look at it. Vince Tibone : Okay, great. David Simon : I think that's, I think that's the other point. I mean, we're not really seeing that's a good point that we're not really seeing kind of that A-assets show up on the market. Vince Tibone : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi good morning. I guess following up on that. For the properties where you have JV Partners, have you seen those investors want to exit more in recent years or they find with the exposures and it's more about where to park incremental dollars for them? David Simon : I would say a lot of them are following the herd mentality. Michael Mueller : Okay. David Simon : I think my guess might be -- I'm not trying to be, am I clear on that. Not, I'll restate what I would be answering. Michael Mueller : No, I think so. I think so. Yes\u2026. David Simon : I think all, I think a lot of the folks out there are you know a little nervous about our business. But you know I would just put it you know not our business, not Simon Property Group business, but I\u2019m nervous about whatever retail generally and so they do tend to, they do tend to follow the herd mentality, that's where somebody maybe us. It\u2019s going to make a lot of money. I assure you. I've seen this movie before, and our cash flows are very very very resilient. If you have good real estate and a good operator, they always evolve and always change. And if you look at the mall that was built in the 60s, you look at the malls that were built in the 70s and 80s and 90s and 2000. Look at the redevelopment I mean, my goodness they changed a lot. And, and they're changing today. So I don't, I don't know. No one here, I mean no one here is overly concerned about it, but all of these guys, they all get that you know it's a lot of people suffer, suffer from groupthink. Okay. Maybe we do too. But we don't. We're in good shape. Michael Mueller : Got it. And I mean, would you think over the next three years, five years or so maybe we see a pickup in you buying out some of these JV Partners or is it a little bit more of a function of you've got a big redevelopment pipeline, a lot of capital that's going there and you're getting bigger returns on that. So it's, I guess that's the tradeoff. How do we think about that? David Simon : Yes, I mean we're focused. Listen I'm going to. If they're nervous, I'm going to buy them at a real big discount, so let them get really nervous. I want them nervous, okay. Nervous is good for us. Okay. So that\u2019s okay. The reality is there could be opportunities. But you know, we'll see. Michael Mueller : Okay, thanks David, bye. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And we have a follow up question from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Hello. Christy if your line is on mute, please unmute. Christy McElroy : Hey, David, it\u2019s Christy here. I know that it's just an accounting question for me and you know that the new straight lining of cam was addressed on the last call. I anticipate straight line trending higher this year, but with the recent bankruptcies I'm just wondering what kind of assessments have been in there? Also for the write-off of occurred straight line rents being uncollectible just with the bankruptcies this year, given the new rules around determination of un-collectability, just trying to get a good sense for what the normal run rate is for that line? David Simon : I mean, that all flows through, so I don't have that off the top of my head. I would say to you. It's not material, but I mean that would do that all the time, right. So that we have to -- we have to make that decision all the time, whether it's collectable or not collectable. Christy McElroy : Okay. I just didn't know if there was a material impact on that line. Aside from that, is it being elevated with the straight lining of camp? David Simon : Not material. Michael Bilerman : David, it's Michael speaking. You talked a little bit about how your stocks of contrarian investment at this point given the multiple, and you've used some of your significant balance sheet capacity to buyback your stock. You did about 300 million in the last six months. You've talked a little bit on this call about maybe partnering with sovereign wealth. It sounds like either buying assets or managing assets they may, or look at new opportunity. No\u2026 David Simon : I don't think, I don't think I said that Michael. So I said, I said, there I said there are very few contrarian investors right now. And we're not really, we're at the very early stages of seeing how they feel about our -- you know the market in general. So I just want to be clear on that, okay. Michael Bilerman : Right. I was listening to when you're talking about maybe working with them, but I didn't know if there is an opportunity to either liquefy some of the value in the assets that you've created. The debt markets provided you a cash amount of capital at a very attractive rates. Right, is your stock that is the one that is associated with the performance that you're putting up. And so, I know in the past you've been reluctant to sell JV stakes in your assets to buyback your stock. I'm wondering, if that's changed at all, or in some of these conversations that you're happy and having if you find that there is an opportunity to partner with contrarian capital, that you want to do that. David Simon : Well, again I have never been a fan to sell an asset-A, to make a mark because A, assets grow historically over time and most everybody that sold A-asset, if they're going to believe it's an A asset in the future. Regret that decision. Okay. So and buying stock back is a temporary investment decision and the reality is we're in this for the long haul as we've demonstrated over almost 26 years has been a public company. So I think that's kind of the worst thing. Frankly, we could do and getting this mark, getting a mark on our portfolio is fool's gold, it's never worked because the next question is, well, what about the rest of the portfolio. So and again, just to reemphasize. So the answer is you know no interest in doing that, number one. Number two is, there are you know, some of these, I mean we're just I don't want to over emphasize and hopefully I didn't I look back at the call, but we're not out running around saying, do you want to go. People come to us we'll talk to them about interest partnership interest, but we're not out soliciting sovereign wealth funds, were not out doing that the reality is we don't need their capital. So, they know my number 1800 David call me if they want, they don't have to. Okay? Michael Bilerman : And I wasn't thinking about it from\u2026 David Simon : I don't want to overemphasize. We've talked to a few here and there. I think they respect what we do but I don't really know, maybe that's a flaw in us that we haven't really solicited them just to have better relationships. But I mean, we've done oaky without them being a major player for us to get to where we are today. We've never needed that in scale. So that's that. So I don't want to overemphasize. We've had discussions here and there, because you know sometimes they call, sometimes they don\u2019t. So we're not out, we're not out trying to buy partnership interest of ourselves or others. We're not out talking to sovereign wealth other than we'll have a couple of conversations. And look, the reality is a lot of that institutional investors as we all know you know have a certain queasiness over retail. We've seen that before, it doesn't affect us. It's not, it doesn't, it affects you, it affects others. It does not affect me and my company in what we do. That's the important point, okay. Michael Bilerman : And I wasn't thinking about it from a positive mark. I was thinking about more so in being able to raise additional capital and invest in your stock, and you know just basically bolster that program that you're doing right now using the free cash flow and capacity, doing something more meaningful if you're able to find an investor that's willing to partner with you. I understand the dynamics, and I understand getting up the growth. I just didn't know if that was part of the psyche today, just given where things stand. David Simon : No, I mean the stuff that look, I think most of the and again we're beaten. You know we're spending more time on this than warranted, but most people, most institutional investors would like to do something you know is as we've talked to him often on over several years. Most of all like to do external stuff with us, variety. And you know but the reality is, we haven't been doing that. So we haven\u2019t been talking to him, okay. So again, it's where we're spending too much time on this. On the other front, look, we've got what you know why are we aggressively buying our stock back? Listen, we love our balance sheet. We'll be you know I think it's an unbelievable advantage. Unbelievable. It's under appreciated. Sorry Tom, I took out your paragraph in a teleconference text, to do $3.5 billion in four hours, you know 30-year bonds, blah blah, blah is all pretty powerful. We don't want to jeopardize that. We've seen when people had overstepped their numbers, overstepped their credit ratings. You know how it kind of can retard the opportunities going forward. We don't want to do that. And importantly, I mean we're in that process of adding to our already successful retail real estate portfolio, and what does that mean? We're doing all this densification stuff. We're building our consumer facing business. You know we're positioning the company for the future. And as we all know, you know any leading company out there is invest in the future. You know from Microsoft to Amazon, to you know go down the list. Every successful company that understands the importance of investment. And so I want the balance sheet that allows us to invest. If I had a criticism of historical retailers, they did not invest in there. And again, it's not for me to criticize, honestly, I don't want this to sound you know like I know it all. But the reality is what we've seen with Rick and I have seen because of strained balance sheets or overspending in one thing versus the other thing is the inability to reinvest in your business is a major no no. So that's, you know that we are not going to do the major no no. Michael Bilerman : Thanks for your time, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks. David Simon : Okay, thank you. Everyone have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

David Simon : Good morning, everyone. We had a very busy productive quarter to end another successful year for our company. Our full year 2019 funds from operation per diluted share was $12.04, which includes a $0.33 charge for the early redemption of our four series of senior notes. Adjusting for the debt charge, our full-year FFO was $12.37 per share, at the upper end of our initial 2019 guidance. Comparable FFO per share for the year increased 4.4%. It is a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, commitment to our strategy that we achieved the upper end of our initial range, even with the number of headwinds we faced during the year, including retail bankruptcies, significant downtime due to major redevelopments at many of our properties and a reduced overage from tourism spending, including the negative impact from the continued U.S. strong dollar, as well as the continued trade tensions limiting visitors. For the fourth quarter reported FFO was $1.045 billion, or $2.96 per share. Comparable FFO was $3.29 per share, an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics, including our comp NOI, which grew with \u2013 our international properties grew at 1.7%. Our comp NOI for domestic properties increased 1.4% for the year. Retailer bankruptcies impacted our comp NOI by roughly 120 basis points and lower overage rent, due to reduced international tourism I mentioned earlier, increased \u2013 impacted our comp NOI growth by 30 basis points to 40 basis points. We are pleased to report that retail sales momentum again accelerated in the fourth quarter, reported retail sales per square foot for our malls and premium outlets was $693 per foot, compared to $661 in the prior year period, an increase of 4.8%. Keep in mind this is on top of more than 5% increase for the prior year. We continue to believe reported retail sales are understated and are negatively impacted by Internet returns of retailer's process at our brick and mortar locations. For the recent holiday period, some media reports quoted in-store sales growth of less than 1.5%, but contrary to our number, which was more than 3% and again, impacted by the Internet returns that occurred at our stores. These sales results further reinforce the benefits retailers experienced from operating in high-traffic, highly productive, well-located real estate. We generated a record of over $1 billion in gift card sales, which was an increase of more than 18% year-over-year. Leasing activity remains solid. Average base rent, minimum rent was $54.59. The malls and premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $7.83, which was an increase of 14.4%. Our malls and premium outlet occupancy at the fourth quarter was 95.1%, which was an increase of 40 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the quarter \u2013 third quarter, down 80 basis points compared to the prior year, which was impacted roughly by 200 basis points from the bankruptcies that we process through the year. We have successfully re-leased approximately 60% of those bankruptcies already. On an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows : retail sales on an NOI-weighted basis is $884 per foot compared to $693; occupancy would be 96% and average base minimum rent would be $73. Now just to move to new developments. We opened one new development in 2019 in Mexico. Construction continues on five new outlet developments in leading markets, including four international destinations and one in the U.S.; Malaga, Spain which will open this month; Bangkok, Thailand; West Midlands, England; and in 2021 Normandy, France and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Very few companies that I know of could open in Thailand and in Tulsa and throw in France for fun. We completed a number of redevelopments and expansions across our portfolio in 2019, including four redevelopments of former department store spaces. We had a very busy year on the expansion of several high-performing international outlets, adding approximately 400,000 square feet in aggregate to centers in Seoul, Korea; Kent, England and Vancouver, Canada. We currently have 15 former department store redevelopment projects under construction. Our share of those costs are roughly $815 million. We have 20 more in our pipeline. And at the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion densification projects were ongoing at more than 30 properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally with our share of that net cost of approximately $1.3 billion. As a reminder, we fund these accretive projects through our internally generated cash flow. And just to give you a sense of the magnitude of some of the downtime, we are dealing with respect to our redevelopment. The projects that we have under construction that will open in 2020 will contribute approximately $70 million of incremental NOI in 2021 as they are stabilized. So again Thailand, France, Tulsa 30 projects under development $1.3 billion. $70 million of NOI that will be generated in 2021. Good comp NOI given a few headwinds. And just to put it in. I know it's a lot of numbers and a lot of going on, but it's important for everybody to understand it. Now let's talk about Aeropostale and ABG, because again we see a lot of misinformation out there and I just -- I think it's important just to give you a sense of our smart capital allocation decisions that continue to differentiate our company. We completed our third full year of owning Aeropostale, so I would like to take some perspective on that investment. I'm going to simplify this. I know it's a lot of information. I'm going to -- and focus on our cash investment our cash investment in Aero OpCo was approximately $25 million. We have already received $13 million of distributions, so I have $12 million of cash invested in Aero OpCo. At the time we bought it, it was producing a negative EBITDA of $100 million and had over 500 stores. Today, today, we expect Aero OpCo to produce EBITDA pre-royalty from 575 stores of approximately $80 million of EBITDA. We believe Aero is approximately, if you put a market multiple on it $350 million today and our ownership is 50%. 12 to three -- to 50% of $350 million. That's the math. Now with respect to ABG we invested -- we made a recent investment in it. So we have a total of 600 -- or sorry $67 million in ABG, Authentic Brands Group. At the time of our original investment, which was roughly $33 million, ABG produced EBITDA of approximately $150 million. Today our value is worth $190 million of our $67 million and ABG is expected to produce EBITDA well north of $350 million and the value is growing every day. Which leads me to Forever 21. As you've read recently, we have recently participated with Brookfield and Authentic Brands Group on behalf of the NewCo, SPAR Group, F21, LLC in a stocking horse bid for certain assets and liabilities in a going concern transaction under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Our Group's successful turnaround of Aero after climbing out of bankruptcy in 2016 gives us confidence with our ability to do the same with Forever 21. Forever 21 is a storied and well -- widely recognized brand with over $2 billion in global sales. We believe F21 similar to Aero presents a very interesting repositioning opportunity. If the transaction is consummated the newco contemplates the continued operations of many of Forever 21 stores and e-commerce business and maintaining many jobs. Our interest in the new venture will be approximately 50%. The aggregate purchase price -- acquisition price is approximately $81 million, plus the assumption of certain ongoing operating liabilities. The process is subject to a go-shop period. The auction is expected to be completed in mid-February with closing shortly thereafter. Now we're not done, sorry. We have balance sheet. So as you know we were very active in 2019. We completed 3-tranche senior notes of $3.5 billion with an average weighted coupon of 2.61% 15.9 years. We retired $2.6 billion of senior debt and our liquidity stands at $7.1 billion. We continue to have the strongest credit profile in the REIT industry. Our net debt-to-NOI is 5.2 times, our interest coverage is 5.3 times and our long-term issuer rating of A2 continues to be the highest in the REIT sector. We paid a record dividend in 2019 of $8.30, a 5.1% increase over 2018. We paid approximately $3 billion in dividends in 2019. And we have paid more than $31 billion in total dividends as a public company. We'll be well over $33 billion this year. And today we announced a dividend of $2.10 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2.4% for the first quarter. Now let me turn to our outlook for 2020. Let me just briefly summarize 2019. We posted another record year of results. Revenues, cash flow, FFO per share dividends all records. We continue to strengthen our company through innovative disciplined investment activities that will allow us to continue to deliver long-term cash flow growth FFO and dividend growth. As a reminder, our 2019 results also included $0.19 per share in income related to insurance settlement at our Opry Mills. Moving on to 2020, our guidance range is $12.25 to $12.40 per share. This range represents approximately 1.7% to 3% compared to our FFO of $12.04. Our range is based on the following assumptions : major redevelopments occurring in many properties resulting in significant downtime; the impact from a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to 2019 levels; comparable NOI growth from our combined malls, outlets, mills and international platforms of 1% -- approximately 1%; no planned or acquisition -- no planned acquisition or disposition activity; and a diluted share count of 354 million shares. To conclude, we had another very busy and successful year. Our company and portfolio is as well positioned as ever and that will only improve with our ongoing investments. Given our track record of earnings growth, NOI and cash flow generation and increasing dividends, we continue to be curious to see the yield of our stock 500 basis points higher than the 10-year treasury. This is an ongoing overreaction to the negative sentiment. However, regardless we remain undaunted. Throughout our history, we have zigged when others have zagged and those moves have served us well. I'm extremely confident of where our business is and about the growth prospects of our company ahead. And we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I wonder if you could characterize the outlet results. Did -- they seemed obviously that to have an impact from the lower traffic, but it also seemed like there were a number of store closings that impact the outlet. If you could just tell us, where the outlet relates to the mall business? David Simon : Well the outlet business had a very good year. I mean the only -- I mean it was affected by certain bankruptcies, but we had significant comp NOI growth. It was higher than the mall business. And the only real shortfall occurred like I said in the overage rent and that was primarily at our bigger centers due to the strong dollar and tourism. So the outlet business we're projecting again for our comp NOI to be higher than the mall business. Again, Craig, don't get caught up in this narrative. We're seeing really good results in the outlet. We'd like a little weaker dollar more tourism. I believe that's temporary. It's good to see that -- obviously we've got a bigger picture going on with the coronavirus and tourism. I assume that will be temporary. However, it's great to see that China and the U.S. completed their trade discussions. And assuming we get through this coronavirus scenario. We expect our overage to continue to be dominant or at the growth in our outlet business. And we have no worries or concerns at all about our outlet business. Tulsa's leasing, Normandy is leasing, Bangkok is leasing, West Midlands and even with Brexit Mexit whatever you want it's leasing. Ashford's leasing. Vancouver is leasing. So I hope that gives you a flavor. So don't believe the narrative. You'll understand what we're doing. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then on the 1% comparable NOI guidance is lower than you achieved in 2019. What would you say are the major drivers of that number? David Simon : Well if I would say primarily because of the downtime. If you -- again, we're a big company so it's a little harder for everybody to understand all that's going on. But if you see the significant redevelopment that we have, we have downtime. And the reality of that is we think in 2021 that we could sit here and we don't have throw away years. You know our philosophy, but we do have significant downtime. That NOI that we've got that takes a decrease. And these are big malls like at Burlington and North Shore and all that stuff. A lot of that stuff is coming on in late 2020. We expect $70 million as I mentioned just from those redevelopments to come on into 2021. Obviously, we're projecting a stronger dollar, so we're muted on our overage rent calculations with our outlet business. And those are the primary. And then obviously we've got some retailer restructurings that are occurring. Some of that's related to the newer rent and that's likely to occur with the F21 stabilization some other restructuring. So you put it all in and that's 1%. I'm not overly worried about that number. I'd like it to be higher, but we've got some things to deal with and we're dealing with them. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then just -- do you have what the leasing spread was just for the fourth quarter in 2019? And was that result somewhat timing-related? David Simon : We don't. We just do it on a rolling 12. Craig Schmidt : Okay. David Simon : That's a number we post. It is what it is. We don't say too much grace over it. Just like sales. I mean we had this discussion on sales and it was the most important thing. Now I understand it's the least important thing. So again, you kind of know our view which is that sales are interesting. They're not determinative because again we can replace retailers that aren't performing. And then we do think our sales per foot are muted by the returns, okay? Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Michael Bilerman : Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David, I wanted to go through some of the investments you're making in retailers and other sort of tech platform initiatives. And the numbers you gave out on Aero surprised you didn't quote out Adam Sandler given we're not too shabby, right? A 15 times multiple on Aero is highly impressive. When you step back, how do you think about all these investments whether it was Aero and potentially Forever 21? And then Life Time, Pinstripes, Allied, PARM, Soho House. I know some of them may be varied. How do you think about the investment itself versus driving disproportionate leasing within Simon's assets relative to all the other retail landlords, right? So how much of it is a benefit not only potentially of turning these retailers around like you did with Aero versus how much of it's incremental leasing that you're going to get out of your assets or protection of stores relative to everybody else? David Simon : Well, first of all let me just talk about the retailer investments. We would not have done Aero and we're -- and we would not be attempting to do Forever 21 for the sole purpose of maintaining our rent. And that's the biggest misnomer out there when I read various publications and analyst notes and media notes. We do it -- we make these investments for the sole purpose of we think there's a return on investment. Now the fact of the matter is we did all this that Aero and the reality is they kept paying us rent. So that's like -- that's obviously beneficial and I don't want to understate that but that's not why we do it. At the same time with F21, we do think there is a business there, but it's got to be turned around. And I'm not going to project today to you what those numbers are, but we've got our work ahead of us. But if we are successful in turning around, we will make money at F21 and we'll get paid our rent. But again the sole purpose is to make investment in our -- for the benefit of our company. Now the rest of them we're creating a flywheel of unique entrepreneurs that understand the benefits of physical space, understand the benefits of the new consumer today. And whether it's Pinstripes or e-gaming or the deal that we did with RGG Rue and Gilt and what's going on with shop Premium Outlets and the deal we did with PARM and Nazarian at the SBE this is a flywheel that no other company in our industry can do. We expect to get the benefit of -- return on those investments. But additionally the ability to make us a better operator and also bring those kind of ideas to our portfolio. So we learn how to be a better operator, we make money on the investment and ultimately in some cases they bring their product to our -- to our physical portfolio. So I can't imagine a better scenario for us, but we're in early days on all of this stuff. But we expect to prosper from these kind of investments. Underlying though is we want them to add value to how we operate as well as to our portfolio and we're doing that. I mean, if you've seen as an example I mean go add chapter verse on this stuff but if you see what Life Time brings with their new concept to our portfolio, you'd say, I get it. Would I rather have that than a moderate underinvested department store and the answer is, come on. It's a no-brainer. Michael Bilerman : Right. Second question I had was if you think about where your NOI breakdown is today between the malls outlets mills and international, which is the pie chart you have on slide 17 and you sort of marry it up with the pie chart of where you're spending your capital, which is slide 28, and then you add in a lot of these other types of investments that you're making where does -- let's say three years out or maybe five years out, where does the composition of your income and asset base shift to from effectively non-retail uses, resi, hotels, office, the totality of all these investments that you're making and then the traditional retail business? What do you think the split would be? David Simon : I mean, it's really -- it's -- we benefit you could argue it either way, but we benefit from the -- I think we really benefit from being a large company. And it's obvious that we're able to make investments and pay our dividend without having to finance our dividend et cetera. So when I look at it we -- even when we look at just our nonretail real estate I mean to get to the NOI of over 5% is going to take a lot of work. But we do like the diversity of our geography, our product-type mills, outlets, malls, our mall business is under 50% of our NOI today. We love the international business. That's been highly profitable. And I think we've got a pretty interesting company because it's so diverse and so big and so well financed. Like I said at the end, I mean we can zig when others zag. Or is it zag with zig I always get confused\u2026 Brian McDade : Either way. Either way. David Simon : Oh, either way. So we can zig when others are zagging and we can zag when others are zigging. Maybe that's the answer. And then we have our whole additional portfolio of other investments that maybe one day we have a spin-off of that. Maybe one day we're not a REIT. Maybe one day, we're just this diversified, interesting company that people will finally think, hey it's not a bad company, not too shabby. Christy McElroy : Hey, David. It's Christy. David Simon : We did -- we did have, not too shabby, in the conference. But we took it out, but if we can use... Christy McElroy : Hey, David. It's Christy. If I could just add a follow-up on Craig's question on comp NOI. So realizing that you're now including international and I assume that's on a constant currency basis. I'm wondering if you could provide sort of an apples-to-apples comparison with the 1.4% growth in 2019 just for North America. And then just a clarification, your comp NOI growth excludes those larger redevelopment projects, is that correct? David Simon : Only a few of those. So not all of them. It depends on the size of a \u2013 we have a definition of that. We have a size of it. And so that's not all of them. It just depends on some of that. So it doesn't really \u2013 international marginally helped. It's not a big deal. I would suggest to you that the biggest thing affecting our comp, as I said to you earlier, is that we do have a lot of redevelopments that are affecting our cash flow. I don't \u2013 and that's when they come on, we'll be $70 million in 2021. There is downtime. I don't think people appreciate that because you're used to dealing with smaller companies, frankly. And you know if they are leasing it out to X, Y, Z, it moves the needle. We're a little bit different and what we \u2013 there is no denying, we've got some leasing to do. Our occupancy is down a little bit. By the way, if you believe the narrative, you think our occupancy year-over-year will be down 500 basis points. It's down 80. We've already leased 60% of it. So, I'm not \u2013 we look at ourselves a little bit different. We give you a year-by-year number. We don't have throwaway years. Our 1%, I think is going to be fine. And if we get a little uptick in overage rent, it will be better. If we don't, it won't and we'll \u2013 life will go on. Christy McElroy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeremy Metz : Thanks. Good morning. David, just one quick one. Go back on Forever 21, just given that, obviously, there is still a process being run here and there are some different outcomes that could come out of this. Just interested, is your current guide, is it built around all stores staying open and just operating at a reduced occupancy costs? Or was that the base that's built in here? David Simon : We don't \u2013 again, given our size and given our historical results, we don't get into specific retailer rents or restructurings. That's for other folks. That's not for us. Jeremy Metz : That's fair. And then we \u2013 as we think about sort of the add inflow of closings and bankruptcies we've seen, 2019, obviously a pretty big year. 2018 was down from 2017 though. So as you look at the landscape today, you look specifically at your outlet and mall portfolio. Obviously, what happened last year and what could be in the pipeline is sucked into the 1% comp outlook. But more high level, how do you feel about the landscape here today, given there is still, obviously, plenty of over-levered retailers out there? Brian McDade : Yeah, I think \u2013 look, I think we're projecting it to be lower than last year, for sure. But it's our \u2013 our point of view and there are no certainties. But I would certainly \u2013 my best judgment call would certainly be to be dramatically less than last year. Last year was a very difficult year when it came to that if you look at. Historically, 2017 was a high year. 2018 was a low year. 2019 was a high year. So, we're anticipating a lower \u2013 certainly a lower amount, but that's our best estimate of what we see today. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And last one for me. As we look at where the stock is, as you mentioned, the misperceptions out there, the big dividend yield spread to cash you've been able to generate. How are you thinking about further stock buybacks at this point, just given the redevelopment pipeline and opportunity there that you outlined? David Simon : Maybe we should go private. It's really what we should do. The reality is, look, it's in our \u2013 we do have the opportunity to do that. We're obviously waiting to see kind of what transpires in the global world right now, but it's something that we'll obviously continue. We do think our company is undervalued. And I would expect this to continue to play into that. It's not in our numbers and we'll see how the next \u2013 know how the next period of time evolves. Jeremy Metz : Thanks for the time. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. I'll change up the answer because you called me out on the \u2013 out there last time. But I will say to Bilerman's thing, he mentioned that you didn't do not too shabby. I would point out that you brought Mexit in which may be the first in REIT-land to mention Mexit. David Simon : That's why I keep saying we're a little bit different than the rest of the folks, okay? Mexit -- by the way, I think it will uptick sales in Vancouver though. So, there'll be a benefit from Mexit. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Well, if you could be a little less different if you go back to the 7 A.M. release time that would be appreciated. David Simon : No problem. We had a technical difficulty. So, it wasn't as bad as the Iowa Caucus, but it was a little bit of a technical difficulty. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So, two questions David. I appreciate that you're not going to comment specifically on individual tenants. But we did notice that Forever 21 dropped out of our top 10 in the fourth quarter. But third quarter obviously -- NOI in the fourth quarter was a lot weaker than previously. So maybe you can just in aggregate talk about what -- to the extent you could talk about the impact in the fourth quarter? And then what your bad debt credit is for 2020 and versus what the actual was in 2019 just to get a sense for how much the 1% is impacted by maybe a change in bad credit versus historical versus other things? David Simon : Well, look we are -- we certainly -- it's not surprising to you. And again I -- you're very kind and you're very smart and that's why you want me to answer these F21 questions. But -- and I don't really want to answer them but I will answer this. Our fourth quarter was clearly impacted by the reductions that us and others provided to F21 to help stabilize their business, okay? And that was -- and that is -- that new scenario is one of the reasons why they dropped out of our top 10. So, it wasn't like we wanted it to drop out of our top 10, but that's just the math. Two is and I -- again, I have to impress upon everyone out there. We do a -- overage rent is an art, not a complete science and it is back-end weighted for the fourth quarter in the outlet business. We actually -- we're way behind an overage rent and all the way up and we made some of it back, but we didn't make what we had originally budgeted. So, when you put the two together that's why we were a little short domestically to get to our 2% original budget. I mean there's no hiding that, there's no denying that, but that is an art and a science. Now, that's why we've been extra conservative I'd say on the overage and the outlet business. But there's a lot going on. I mean right now tourism is way down in the United States. I don't control that. Usually, we're a beneficiary of that, but sometimes we run into a headwind. But that has nothing to do with the long-term viability of this great real estate and these great properties and that's what we have to as investors and as you as analysts and us as operators all have to kind of overlook these temporary things. So, we did -- so in summary, I hope I answered the question. In summary, our fourth -- our Q4 was impacted by what we did with F21. It was impacted the shortfall in the overage rent with the outlets. We're projecting a similar scenario next year so hopefully we'll be conservative on that but time will tell. And obviously that does the restructure of F21 because it was a big, big retailer does have -- it does flow through 2020 as well. I hope that answers -- on the bad debt, it's basically pretty flat from 2019 which was a pretty decent-sized year. So, that -- but again, there's no longer bad debt. It's just you don't get the income you thought you'd do, okay? And from an accounting point of view being an old GAAP accountant I still scratch my head on that. But the reality is it's no longer a bad debt, you just don't get all the income you thought you were going to get revenue. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question goes to the dividend. You obviously highlighted where your yield is relative to the tenure. You guys always point out your sort of mid-single-digit dividend increases over the years. But maybe that mirrors your taxable dividend increase in which case it will -- it won't be lower. But just given it seems like your comments that the market is not appreciating your dividend and the guidance coming in a little short of where The Street is, should we brace ourselves that maybe you don't increase the dividend this year or maybe the increase is nominal maybe 1%? Or your view is to continue growing it in the sort of mid-single-digits even if the market doesn't appreciate it in the stock price? David Simon : Well, look, I think we'll continue to grow our dividend. We have earnings growth next year -- or this year I should say, 2020. We grew 2.4% Q-over-Q. So, that's certainly a signal to you that we are not backing off our dividend growth. I mean, will it be as high as 8% or 10%, like it's been over the last five years or six years? It may -- probably not. But again, I don't think -- I look at it -- I guess, if you were in my shoes, when I hear the word bracing, I just want to explain to you, we're not bracing here, my friend. We're on the offense. We actually feel good about our company. We feel great about our dividend. We feel great about our balance sheet. We feel great about these other investments we're going to make. We're going to hopefully turnaround F21 and make money. So the last thing -- the last word you will never see in our -- hopefully, I shouldn't say never, but we don't -- we're not bracing here. Okay. Yes, we have some leasing to do, given the high amount of bankruptcies. We've already leased 60%. Yes, I'd like to see tourism come in. Strong dollar does limit spend. I mean, you will see that from other retailers, the retailers that have an important exposure to tourism. We have all that redevelopment in 2020 that's ongoing, that takes properties down. I mean, at a mall, at Northgate that did $18 million of NOI, it does zero, zero today. I mean, zero. And we accelerated it and we have development rights that could make that property worth $1 billion. Again, we don't have throwaway years, Alex, as you know. And so, yes, this year will be not as robust growth as maybe some of the years in the past. That doesn't mean we're bracing, no bracing here, not in our vocabulary. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Rich Hill : Hey, David. Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Rich Hill : Just one quick clarification. I think what you said was F21 is still in the pool. It's just a lower tenant and therefore, should we assume F21 as a tenant, is included in the 2020 FFO guide? David Simon : Yes, yes. We and others adjusted the rent for the fourth quarter. And because of the base rent, it's number 11 or 12. What is it? Brian McDade : Number 12. David Simon : 12. They're 12. Forever 21 is in our top 12. Okay. Rich Hill : Got it. That's helpful. That\u2019s why I promised you that's the last question. I'm going to ask about Forever 21. David Simon : No problem. We have no problem with any questions anybody wants to ask. Rich Hill : Sure. And so, actually just staying along this line of your investments in retailers and I appreciate why they've been really attractive investments for you. So two questions. First of all, are these held in the TRS? I think they are. And then number two, do you have a sense for how high you could go with your retail investments before you got up your non-REIT limit in the TRS? David Simon : Yes, they are in our TRS. And there's a lot going on, technically, about this that the NAREIT's working on. And I'll just defer that, because it's a little arcane. But we've got plenty of room and given that it's in our TRS, we've got plenty of room that we're not going to -- there's no issue about maintaining REIT status about income or gross asset test and all this -- all of it, all of the various REIT tests that you have to meet. So, we've got plenty of room to run. Rich Hill : Yes. And I was really saying that not from -- are you hitting the limit, but it seems like this is an attractive investment pool that might warrant some further consideration in the future. David Simon : Yes, look, I think, we -- I guess, Rich, what I'd say to you, we're grounded in real estate, but we have over time found that we can do other things reasonably well and that is our goal to do that. We've had success, we haven't been perfect. And if we do end up buying with Brookfield and Authentic Brands Group, Forever 21, I mean, obviously, that's going to be a lot of work. That is a big restructure ahead of us and that we'll want to make sure that that's done right, and there are no guarantees on that. So don't expect another retailer that will pop up until we get that stabilized. But at the same time, we're always looking at additional investments. I mean, we're very excited about the long-term prospects that we have with our -- basically, our merger with RGG. And we're just starting that whole process and that's a whole another avenue for this company in terms of e-commerce and tenant relationships and retailer loyalty, and all the other stuff that comes with that. And we're just -- that we literally just closed in November. And we merged our operations into those and they're just starting to improve our shop premium marketplace. So, I mean, there is a lot of growth ahead of that as well. And then you've got all of the mixed-use stuff that we're doing, whether it's Northgate, whether it's Phipps. You go down the list. I mean, there is a lot going on and that's why we feel good about where we're positioned. Rich Hill : Got it. And just two final things for me on Forever 21. I know I told you I wouldn't ask about it again, but I can't help myself. Your 50% investment, should we think about that as 50% on top of your 25% investment and top of your 50% investment in ABG? Would that 50% include the look-through on ABG? David Simon : No, no, no. It's just \u2013 it's actually a little under 50% to be technical, it's approximately 50%. No, that's a separate standalone entity. It has nothing to do with our investment. And we \u2013 our \u2013 we only own around a little over 6% of ABG. Okay. Rich Hill : Okay. Got it. And then, you didn't buy back any shares this quarter, despite what the stock price has done. Is that just a simple capital allocation decision given your discussions you are having on F2021? David Simon : No. I just think, we got busy and no real good reason. Obviously \u2013 unfortunately, we made the right choice not to buy it back, right. But I just think we were busy in the fourth quarter and everything else. Rich Hill : Got it. Touche. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Just going back to the guidance. Can we get what the total NOI growth embedded is? And as well, are there any one-time charges that are dragging down the FFO number? David Simon : No, not that \u2013 nothing material, no. Nick Yulico : And what about the total NOI growth number? David Simon : We \u2013 this is what we gave. It is consistent with our past practice. Nick Yulico : Okay. I guess, I'm just wondering if there was anything else that's \u2013 if the number is going to be similar to your comp NOI number like it's been or? David Simon : Yeah. I mean, look, I think, on some of these that are in our non-comp pool, we have this downtime that I've alluded to. I mean, I \u2013 we can quantify it for you, but we all kind of put it in the blender. And that's where our guidance is. I mean, we had significant \u2013 put it this way, we expect in 2021 to generate around $70 million of additional NOI and most of that is still dealing with our downtime. Now, we've got expansions that are opening up worldwide, which usually come in. The strategy there is a little bit different. Lease-up is not 95%, tends to be a little bit lower. So, we just have one of these years that because of all the activity you're not \u2013 it's not manifesting itself in the growth, but we don't have a throwaway, yet we're still going to grow our earnings. We're still going to grow our dividend. We're still going to have the best balance sheet. We are still going to make these fund investments. We're still going to keep moving the portfolio. And it's just \u2013 I mean, the people do have a year that doesn't necessarily have terrific growth, because we're making all these investments. It's \u2013 you see it elsewhere. We were a static company, I get it, but we're not. We're really busy. Does that help? Nick Yulico : Yeah. And then, David, it is helpful to get that $70 million benefit to NOI in 2021 from the redevelopments coming online later this year. I guess, what we don't know is what this ongoing drag from redevelopment could be? Meaning that, is that going to be purely a benefit in 2021, or are there still some of this redevelopment downtime to deal with? And I guess, I'm wondering at some point, would you think about maybe providing some sort of NOI bridge? I mean, it's something the office REITs have done to deal with lumpiness and tenant move-outs and tenants being refilled. And I think it would be pretty helpful to understand what that, how that plays out to get to the growth of the company over the next couple of years. David Simon : Yeah. I mean, it's possible. We don't we \u2013 like people just have seen, what we're doing and then the results of it manifests itself. But this is an active year of investment and redevelopment and the growth will have some impact to do that. We've also had a history of outperforming our guidance. And I mean, let's face it, we're being conservative. There is a lot of noise around the world from an economic. And obviously, it's an election year. We've got this terrible situation on the virus, and we don't know what that means. So, there is a lot \u2013 there is a lot going on. But I'll go back to \u2013 I think Alex had phrased. I mean, we're investing in the future and we feel really good about kind of all the stuff that we're doing and it will manifest itself in 2021 and beyond. But like Phipps \u2013 I mean, Phipps is a great example. I mean, the malls torn up and that stuff is going to come on late 2021. So that's not even in that number. So, but your point is valid. We've never wanted to do that because we've never wanted to have people think we're having a throwaway year, but this will be somewhat of a year of investment. And that happens with, I mean, it's happened with them, nothing compares to Amazon, but it's happened with the big companies that say, yeah, they are investment, I mean. So that's what we're doing. We'll see where it shakes out. Not unusual. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Just a quick one. Were the rent spread trends in the fourth quarter outside of Forever 21 stable? Would you characterizing this? David Simon : Yeah. We had a very -- we had a -- like I said, we underperformed in our overage all year with the outlet business and they had a really good fourth quarter. It just didn't -- if you understand how overage works, you've got to get over the break point and you've got to do it. So we caught up on that. We actually were underperforming all the way through the fourth quarter. They had a very good fourth quarter. We didn't see any real retailer changes too much, and I think sales were pretty good and we leased up space. We didn't think we would get to 95. We got a little over 95 once. So, I think we had a pretty good fourth quarter, all things considered. I mean, again, I don't do your models, but I look at -- I know my business pretty well. And the reality is that I think we had a pretty good fourth quarter. Michael Mueller : Got it. And then I think you mentioned you could quantify the redevelopment drag on that 1% same-store outlook. Can you do that? David Simon : Yeah. We will do that at some point. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Linda Tsai : Hi. Could you share with us some very broad steps you took to get Aero EBITDA positive and how these processes might translate to getting Forever 21 in a similar place? I mean in your opinion, is retail distress somewhat formulaic and what's holding back retailers from fixing themselves? David Simon : Well, every retailer has its own particular sort of issues. I think Forever 21, really the biggest issue that it had historically was that it took its eye off the ball, primarily because of the international growth. And then it created another brand that took its eye off the ball and then, obviously, the store size got too big. So, we are really good at sourcing and that's where Authentic Brands Group is fantastic at sourcing product. We think in Forever 21's case, it was fast-fashion and the time that we got for delivery of goods would shock you in terms of how long it took. So, we kind of took the fast-fashion out of fashion. And obviously, Forever 21 -- or I'm sorry, ABG's graded branding. I mean if you look at -- we're an investor in Sports Illustrated. They bought the Sports Illustrated IP. If you have seen kind of how they've already created all the buzz around Sports Illustrated, it's a great example of what they do. You look at how they branded Shaquille O'Neal as an example. That's what they do. So, they bring all that marketing and the brand awareness expertise to bear. We did the same thing with Aero. So each year -- you have to diagnose the problem. There is a lot to restructure at F21. On the other hand, it is a brand that does close to $2 billion of volume, even with the -- all that's going on. So, I mean that was what we looked at Aero. When Aero -- when we took it over $900 million, we are talking about $50 million business. So that gives us -- it gives us a comfort and it's sourcing, marketing, it's better efficient, more organizations, better technology. And it's just common sense being better operator and between the -- our and it's also being an owner that can withstand just -- withstand stock, right. So, you don't panic. And you just -- you keep your head down and you keep plowing. We did that with Aero. We told Aero we don't care about comp NOI, comp sales. What we care about is building the business for the future, focus on EBITDA margins, focus on gross margins, focus on increasing the quality of the product and we don't care about comp sales. Now, it's a little bit like our business. There is a too much of a focus on quarter-to-quarter comp NOI growth. We get it. We focus on it because we love cash flow. But at the same time, we've got to make investments for the future that will accelerate that comp. There is no difference. The only difference is that we don't panic and others do. And that's why we're here calm about it. Linda Tsai : Do you think the timeframe for getting Forever 21 EBITDA positive will be similar to that of Aero? David Simon : I would say that -- it's a good question. And I would say, it's a little more complicated in a little bigger business. And it depends on whether one or two of my guys are going to spend all this time in Los Angeles. So, I'm negotiating it right now, Linda. Stay tuned. Linda Tsai : Then just one other follow-up, given this environment of closures, how are you thinking about the credit worthiness of the new tenants you're signing on? What sort of process do you go through to get comfort around their brand relevance and stability and liquidity? David Simon : Well historically, we've been very focused on that. We're very \u2013 we are very -- look, that's not to say, we don't take flyers here and there. But we're probably -- if you asked around, we're probably as thoughtful on that as anybody in our industry. And it's very important to us, especially if we make any kind of tenant improvements. We're very focused on payback and credit worthiness. We don't bet a thousand there, but we are -- it's extremely important to us. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Simon : Hello? Okay. Let's go to next. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first one is on redevelopment. Looking ahead to 2021, and what appears to be a positive inflection in your earnings growth, helped by the expansion of the redevelopment last year up to, I think was $1.8 billion well above the one point, the lower ones if you via graph couple of years. And hopefully, some of that incremental NOI growth can help change that narrative around the stock. So, I guess my question is on the sizing of the pipeline beyond this year. Your intention to keep the redevelopment pipeline size around where it is, you know that $1.8 billion where it's been over the past year. Are you more inclined on reducing that back to the level that you've run over the past few years in the low $1 billion and maybe preserving more cash flow for other uses and potentially unanticipated other tenant events or even opportunistic investments? David Simon : Well, again, a good question. I would say to you, just wonder because of our diversity in product type, geography, etcetera every incremental investment can and will stand on its own. So, we don't feel compelled to save an asset because we're worried about the -- hitting our numbers or anything else. So, we're making all of these investments with an eye toward incremental return. And we do expect, as we said, historically, yeah, we're going to be busy because we're going to get the ability to get a lot of great real estate back hopefully at reasonable prices that we can add accretive returns to. So, I don't view it as a zero-sum game. And I also don't think that it's -- that we don't have the -- firepower to make this additional investments outside of our, what I'd say, our core businesses. So -- but the important thing is, I don't feel compelled to say, oh, this small, if I don't do this, I got to do a low return deal. Just to say that, I mean the reality is, if it ain't worth, then we don't invest and it's not going to -- it's not going to -- it's not going to really cause too much of a debt from it. So -- and we are looking at other investments that are outside of kind of the traditional bricks and mortar and I think we'll continue to do that. But we'll also continue to make investments in brick and mortar because there's -- nothing has changed about it. It's a good business. It's just -- yeah, it's -- we are running through a cycle here that's not as robust as what it's been in the past. But you've got to remember, we've been doing this for a long time and we've weathered the different storms. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. Second question is on the 2020 guide. For another income, is there anything contemplated in the guide for other income, anything that could materially move that FFO guide this year one way or the other? And G&A, it looks like it was down $10 million last year. What's embedded in the guide for G&A this year? Thank you. David Simon : Sure. G&A is similar to what fourth quarter is. So right guidance, yeah. And I -- we don't have anything real extraordinary in other income in 2021 that's quite unusual. As you know, we had the big settlement from the insurance company of Opry in 2019 in the first quarter. So that will \u2013 our first quarter compare to first quarter of Q1, 2020, will look different than Q1 of 2019 because that's when we got the settlement from Opry Mills. It only took us seven years, eight years. Okay. That's another story. Haendel St. Juste: All right. Thank you. David Simon : No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks a lot. Good morning out there. When I look at your lease expirations for 2020, it doesn't seem like you made much headway. It's just one quarter from -- going from 3Q to 4Q. But it went down 30 basis points. When I look at last year, you made much more headwind or headway closer towards 100 basis points. Like I said, I know it's just one quarter, but I was just curious if there's anything to read into that or are you kind of just making decision a little bit later? David Simon : No, it's just process and there is absolutely nothing to read into that. It's all process, no issue. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just going back to Forever 21. You talked about the flywheel and I think we all get it. But that's why it was also very different for a Simon owned store versus if it was owned by a different landlord. So, how do you balance those things? David Simon : We -- look, I think the only history we really have on that is Aero. And I think if you ask the other landlord, they said, we were great partners. So no issue there. Interesting question. But we really -- I mean, every store at Aero basically stood on its own. We were not really involved in it. That was all delegated to the team, the operating team at Aero. So, we did not get involved in that. I think at F21, to the extent that we get it, we'll adopt a similar thing. And we, in fact, at Aero -- at Forever 21 because of the need to move probably a little quicker than at Aero and the case is moving a little bit quicker. We'll probably hire a third-party just to go do it. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Vince Tibone : Good morning. You mentioned earlier you have 15 former department store redevelopment projects underway with the total expected spend about $850 million, so that equates to about $55 million per box. I'm just thinking about longer term CapEx need, is $55 million per department store box a fair assumption? David Simon : No. And you can't get out of it. That math you really can't do. And I think that it's not -- Vince, I would say to you, it's not necessarily CapEx. It's incremental opportunity. So -- and I've said this before. But just to put it in perspective, if we don't own the department store and that department store owns 10 acres, then we just now have 10 new acres that we -- that we can develop. It's not like, when we take CapEx, people think new roof, new tile, new this, new that. It's incremental opportunity because we don't necessarily control that space. And even if we were on a long-term lease, to the extent that we've got that lease, we now control their space. So it's new incremental space that we did, in other words, so -- Vince Tibone : Right. But I'm just trying to get a sense of -- so that includes probably a lot of other non-retail uses. So, what would be a fair run rate of just trying to think about longer term if we're expecting more department stores to close? I mean just from a -- maybe not from a CapEx burden perspective, but just how much capital you're going to have to spend every year to keep -- to unlock these opportunities? That's what I'm trying to get at more than anything. David Simon : Well, look, I think what you should do, we can give you order of magnitude. I mean, I can do a check in personnel, but I might bore you. You can call up -- you can call up Tom. And yes, what would be in order of magnitude? Like, take an example of Phipps. Phipps is $300 plus million. Okay. Midland Park, Texas was $5 million. So it's all over the place. But if you want -- the best thing for you to do, Vince, to get a handle on it is that, Northgate, we could spend $600 million, $700 million at Northgate. So certain boxes are $10 million. Just take a box over, re-lease it, that kind of thing. So really, really is real estate specific. But maybe you go through our 8-K and Tom could give you order of magnitude. But Phipps is a great example. It's a former department store that was on lease, where we let them terminate the lease for payment and then we're spending literally $300 million in -- little over $300 million to build a hotel, office and Life Time and additional retail, all in that same spot. And so that can skew numbers pretty significantly. Vince Tibone : No, that makes sense. That's really helpful. Can you just discuss quickly how the overage rent thresholds are reset each year? Just trying to get a sense of like the lower percentage rents paid in 2019, creates an easier comp for 2020 or that's not the case, they kind of increase by a fixed amount each year? David Simon : It usually kind of balances out. So, there's not a lot of volatility. Other than the outlet business, a number of our bigger retailers, they are basically on percentage rent with a very low base. So that's the one that tends to have a little more volatility. In the mall business, we tend to mark the real estate. If they're in overage, we tend to get that as it renews and then others come in. So it's relatively traffic consistent. So, you have overage and then they go -- their leases expire. You go to basically overage, plus the base rent to get to the total rent and then whole another slew of retailers will go into overage. The outlets tend to be a little longer leases, a little lower base. And therefore, they don't have as much turn. So therefore, the overage rent tends to be a little more volatile in terms of what the math ends up in. Vince Tibone : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Yeah. No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Just a follow-up on Forever 21. Sorry. Just in terms of the approach to making these retailers profitable again and sort of solidifying the business, there's a going concern. You answered Linda's question. But how does your approach differ and is perhaps much healthier for retailing longer term than the traditional private equity approach to retailer turnarounds? And in addition to store closures and the efficiency, and technology, and marketing and operations that you discussed, do you look to convert rents to sort of percentage sales for a period of time to get landlords more in partnership with these retailers? David Simon : I would say it depends on the scenario. I think, F21, to stabilize it, we might have to do that for a period of time. At Aero, we -- they did a lot of the work on the landlords free during the bankruptcy process. Aero was a little quicker. So, we don't have a lot of time to do it. They did initial things. So it depends on -- it really depends on the scenario. And it's certainly a tool that's available to us. And there's ways to handle it, I think, the landlord community will support us to the extent that we're successful in the auction. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then, just a follow-up on Vince's CapEx question to you. You had about $192 million of TIs at share in 2019, close to $1 billion of redevelopment and development spend. How should we think about that capital outlay in 2020, as we look at use of free cash flow, especially as the turnover is elevated and could push up TIs, and with everything that you have in the value creation pipeline coming on later this year and into 2021? David Simon : Yeah. I mean, look, I think the TIs went up by $20 million. So, yes, to me that's not going to really change. We're doing more restaurants, a little more entertainment, so you see. The other thing that really spikes that number was we did a number of, kind of, best of brands luxury retailers and I don't want to name names. But they tend to have great build out. It's great for the properties, but you -- kind of the uber luxury folks, their investment in their stores tends to be a little bit higher. So, I think you get -- we did some great work last year on that. So, we're seeing a little bit of a spike, but the TIs not really much of an issue and the development, again I don't know what else to tell you other than that we are going to have these opportunities from department stores. We think they are, net-net, it's going to be beneficial to our company and to the existing real estate. And the role that we play in the community is unbelievable. So, give you an example, between sales tax and real estate taxes at a place like Roosevelt Field, we pay $135 million and the warehouse down the street pays basically nothing. We did a study that said warehouse and distributions pay less than one-tenth of what we pay in real estate taxes. So, that's what's interesting. We're making these places better for the community, better for the taxpayers. We have a -- we're doing -- believe it or not, we're doing specific duties that others aren't in terms of what -- as you know, we do believe strongly and we refute others that suggest otherwise. But we do think we provide a greener atmosphere for commerce and there's just so much we're doing that that it's maybe not necessarily appreciated. But we know what we're doing for these communities. We know what we're doing for the taxes for sales and real estate taxes. And we're also making our real estate better and that's fine. We'll take that responsibility on. Michael Bilerman : Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman speaking. Earlier in the call, you talked about buying real estate that bricks and mortar, obviously, still has a great future. And that's -- you're not going to deviate from that. And when buying makes sense, you would do it, sort of paraphrasing a comment you made. There was a headline that came across on Bloomberg during the call that you potentially had merger talk with Taubman and that eventually broke off given the market volatility. Can you comment on that, please? David Simon : What would you -- you know we don't comment. But -- we don't comment on those market rumors. I haven't seen it. We've been busy on this call. So, I'm not sure what you're referring to but we'll check it out. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Yeah. It's always just helpful to get the views on whether something could happen or not. And I know the stock buyback wasn't happening during the fourth quarter. So, I assumed whether there were something else going on that would have done that. Brian McDade : No, we, obviously made the right trade. The stock went down. So, we can buy it cheaper now. Michael Bilerman : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Sorry about the earlier technical difficulties. I guess, David, just to maybe piggyback or ask Michael's question a little differently. Just in terms of like acquisition opportunities. Obviously, there is really a lack of capital that's devoted to the mall space today. Everybody is kind of fleet on the institutional side. Are there opportunities that you see to potentially deploy capital outside of your existing portfolio? David Simon : Well, I would say you, generally, yes. I mean, we've intended -- we would tend to -- I mean, I think they're worldwide. I mean retail real estate is way out of favor worldwide, not just in the U.S. And as you know, we've built our company to do this. We don't have to do that. We've got lots of -- if anything on this call, I know it's dragged on here; it's like a college football game. But we -- I feel really good about where we're at. So, we don't have to -- on the other hand, as I said earlier, we zig when others zag or we zag when others zig. And sometimes, we usually land on our feet, not always. But we -- our industry is way out of favor worldwide, that's interesting to note. But we know what these properties generally mean to the community, and to the consumer, and to the retailer. Bricks-and-mortar are important. This real estate is greatly located. So -- and then we have kind of all the other stuff that we're doing in conjunction with our core business and it's a unique time for us to think what we want to do in the future. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then, not to beat the dead horse on the earnings guidance in the lost income. But I do think it would be helpful to the extent that you have intentionally take properties offline, similar to what you did in Northgate last year. I think it would just be helpful to kind of know what that drag is within your guidance number this year. Is it a couple of pennies? Is it a nickel? Is it a dime? I think, just kind of frame out kind of why -- when you look apples-to-apples at the midpoint, guidance is down a little bit. Brian McDade : Yeah. Look, I think that's a good point. We try to do that, maybe not as artfully as we should have, but we try to do it by showing to you that we're going to have a $70 million pick up next year when the stuff comes online. But I guess, what we didn't do is give you a sense of the decrease that we have this year. But I'd just tell you that Northgate certainly -- it's a good example. That was a property doing 15, 16, 17, 18 in that range and it's basically going to be zero for the next future. That won't pick up in 2021 because it's a long-term project, but will be great in the future. And it is also paid. So, we've got a property here that we could add to uses incrementally depending on demand. So it's not like, we did over our fees, the best of all worlds. Steve Sakwa : Okay. That's it for me. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Hey, I'm going to try to get out of the queue. David Simon : Hope, we didn't offend you. Take care. Michael Mueller : That's okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. You line is now open. David Simon : I think Rich stopped, too. Okay. I think that's it. Thank you for your time and interest. And we'll talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The team has adapted to a constantly changing environment. We made difficult decisions and successfully transitioned to a remote work environment in our corporate and regional offices. We implemented new protocols to adapt how we operate our properties for the safety of our shoppers, employees and tenants. And I\u2019m frankly very proud of the entire team, Simon team. Now turning to our first quarter results, they were largely in line with our expectations. Reported FFO, funds from operation, was $980.6 million or $2.78 per share. As a reminder, the prior year period included $0.24 per diluted share from insurance settlement proceeds and a gain on a sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property. In the current period, the operations of our investment in retailers were negatively impacted by approximately $0.06 per share pre-tax due to store closures as a result of the COVID-19 government shutdown. Adjusting the current period for the COVID-19 impact, our investment in retailers and the prior year period for the insurance proceeds and the residential asset sale gain that I mentioned above, comparable funds from operation for the current year period is $2.83 compared to last year of $2.80. Comp NOI was flat in the quarter and portfolio NOI decreased 20 basis points year-over-year. Occupancy for our premium and mall portfolio at quarter end was 94% average base minimum rent was $55.76. And our mall and outlet portfolio recorded leasing spreads of $2.80 per square foot or an increase of 4.6%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and outlets were $703 for the trailing 12 months ended February 29 compared to $660 in the prior-year period, an increase of 6.5%. When you include March, even though we were shut down since March 18, reported retailer sales still increased 2.1%. Our portfolio was performing well. We saw solid trends in shopper traffic, tenant demand, retail sales and our results including our retail investments until the COVID-19 stay-at-home recommendations and orders began to be issued in the middle of March. Now let\u2019s talk about some of the actions we\u2019ve taken. We were the first large retail owner and operator to close our property system-wide to address the spread of the pandemic. We\u2019re the first to reopen our properties, of course subject to government stay-at-home orders and restrictions. We took immediate and decisive actions to aggressively reduce our operating costs and increase our financial resources, including but not limited to some of the following : suspended or eliminated more than $1 billion of capital for redevelopment and new development projects in the US and internationally. Our current investment focus is on projects nearing completion. We will re-evaluate all suspended projects over time. Importantly, our share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects under construction is approximately $160 million. We significantly reduced property operating expenses and all non-essential corporate spending. We also made some very, very difficult decisions regarding our employees, including a reduction in force and furloughed a certain of our field and corporate personnel due to closures of our properties as a result of government stay-at-home orders. We implemented a freeze on all hiring efforts. We lowered base salaries across the senior executive team and implemented a shared salary reduction plan for higher compensated employees and deferred certain executive bonuses. Our board also played their part by agreeing to temporarily reducing their cash retainer fees. And we drew down $3.75 billion under our revolving credit facility, which increased our cash position including our share of joint venture cash to over $4 billion at the end of March. Now some positive news on reopening, the health and safety of our communities of course will always be our highest priority. Last week, we started reopening our properties in markets where local and state closures orders have been lifted and where retail restrictions have been eased. As part of the ongoing reopening process, we published our comprehensive COVID-19 Exposure Control Policy that was developed in connection with the leading experts in the field of Epidemiology and Environmental Health and Safety experts in order to ensure the highest possible safety standards at our properties. You can see these on online, but let me just name a few. Our safety protocols include pre-emptive employee health screening, employee safety protections, promotion and enforcement of social distancing practices, enhanced sanitizing and disinfecting and of course shopper safeguards. These protocols meet or exceed the guidelines published by the CDC and are more robust and many of the measures deployed by essential businesses and online fulfillment centers that have remained opened during this pandemic. We implemented the temporary closures of our centers to protect our shoppers and the communities in which we serve from the spread of the coronavirus. We are now leading the effort for these local economies to get back to business while delivering a new elevated standard of safety for all. Now, we have opened, as of today, 77 of our properties and are planning to have approximately half of our US portfolio opened within the next week. We are, of course, working in conjunction with state and local governments on our reopening plans. Shopper response to our re-openings has been positive. And sales of many tenants have been better than their initial expectations. Additionally, we have opened 12 of our designer and international premium outlets. Now, let me turn to our tenant update. Of course, we\u2019re in the midst of discussions with our tenants regarding their individual situation. And as such, it is not appropriate to comment on specific details or terms at this point due to the confidential nature of those discussions. Each situation is analyzed individually based upon our tenants\u2019 market position, their financial status and the history and depth of our relationship. I am sure you can respect this. These discussions are ongoing. And as we complete them, we are more than prepared to share the appropriate information. Our tenants are eager to reopen their stores and we are working with them to do so. We are also very focused on helping local entrepreneurs reopen and are also supporting our restaurant operators both nationally and locally. Now, let me turn to the balance sheet. We have always maintained a strong balance sheet in order to capitalize on opportunities, but also to withstand economic downturns. On March 16, two days before we shut down our portfolio, we amended and extended our $4 billion credit facility with a $6 billion facility that includes a $2 billion delayed draw term loan. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $8.7 billion consisting of $4.6 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity and the $4.1 billion of cash mentioned earlier. As a reminder, the $8.7 billion is net of $1 billion of US and Euro commercial paper that was outstanding at quarter end. Commercial paper market is open and continues to find stability. Investment demand for our paper has increased allowing us to successfully issue over $375 million during the last couple weeks. We currently have approximately $500 million outstanding between our US and Euro CP programs. For the remainder of the year, we have $900 million of unsecured notes maturing and a limited number of maturing non-recourse secured loans to single purpose entity borrowers. Our debt covenants remain well above, well above the required levels with significant headroom. Now, given the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the global economic disruption it has caused, it is not currently possible to predict with certainty the pandemics impact on the rest of our year\u2019s financial results. As a result, we are withdrawing our full-year 2020 guidance for estimated net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share, estimated FFO per diluted share and comparable property NOI growth, which we provided on February 4, 2020. As of today, over 700 public companies have withdrawn their full-year guidance. Let me turn to the dividend. The board will declare a second quarter dividend before the end of June and that dividend will be paid in cash. We expect to pay out at least 100% of our taxable income in 2020 in cash. As a point of reference, there had been over 175 public companies who have either suspended or reduced their common stock dividend by 50% or more. We will not be one of those companies. Let me turn to the Taubman transaction. As you know, we announced a transaction with Taubman on February 10, 2020 and we will not make any comments or provide any updates on this call about the status of the Taubman transaction. We will provide information as and when appropriate. Finally, concluding before we turn it over to Q&A, most importantly, I want to thank all of my colleagues for busting their ass. I also reflect on the last few weeks and how our company has responded two words come to mind, resilience and innovation. We have managed through many severe crisis over the decades whether natural disasters, bubble burst, numerous recessions, et cetera. Each crisis had its own unique circumstances just as we face today with this pandemic. Well, one thing I know with certain is Simon team will be focused on the long-term needs of our stakeholders and once again will come out ahead. And we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good evening. Good evening, David, out there. So, two questions from us. And first, David, on the dividend, good to hear you talk about cash given what we\u2019ve heard from others on the whole offset between accrued rents still mandating taxable income versus cash. So, good to hear that you guys are going to pay cash. Just a question, as you guys have seen re-openings in Asia and your overseas centers, what lessons have you learned there and what have you seen as far as shopper rebound? Has it been more the core shopper coming back? Have people been pretty open to accepting all the accommodations and getting back to sort of normalcy or your view is from what you\u2019ve seen overseas it may take longer for the shopper and the tenant to rebound? David E. Simon: Well, I think, it\u2019s actually, we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised. We would like, I think, the retail community in Europe was a little bit more prepared to open. So, they\u2019ve had a higher percentage of retailers open, Alex. And I think the biggest reason has been the rules there have been a little clearer. And they don\u2019t have different municipalities basically directing different rules so to speak. So, they were a little bit more prepared, plus in a lot of cases their employees were not on furlough, so it was easier for them to get up, but I think our sales have been somewhat better than what we\u2019re seeing in Europe. And in Asia, we\u2019ve been basically open except recently Japan closed. But we were doing, believe it or not, reasonably well in Asia until kind of the last month when both Malaysia and Japan had to shut down. South Korea has been fine. So, I think as - I think the retail community didn\u2019t anticipate we were going to open. We kept telling them we were going to open. We opened, but the consumers actually been very supportive. Obviously, they want to see more stores open as do we. But I think it\u2019s a process and you got to get started and you go from there. So, some of the sales have been much better than what we expected and in some cases comped higher than last year. But that - I do think for the retailers that are opening, they\u2019re gaining market share, they\u2019re taking advantage of pent-up demand and I think others that aren\u2019t ready are missing that opportunity. But that\u2019s up for them. We\u2019re not forcing the issue at all, but in terms of whether retailers open or not, but we want to help these local communities because frankly they depend on our sales tax and our real estate tax. I think the municipalities and the government ultimately are going to appreciate what we\u2019ve done over year-after-year delivering sales and property tax payments and they don\u2019t have that at the rate that they\u2019re used to, and I think finally we\u2019ll garner some respect that we deserve. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, obviously a lot of tenants, I guess, have not paid, you haven\u2019t disclosed the level, but I\u2019ll let that be. But have you noticed your tenants reaching out to their banks, their lenders, to get default waivers? So, if they\u2019re not paying you, the landlord, they\u2019re not being in default of their own lending standards or have you seen most of your tenants not applied for those waivers from their end? David E. Simon: I think they generally what I hear for the financially solid retailers, there\u2019s not an issue in terms of them getting the capital. And, look, I will tell you, I mean, we\u2019re not giving a percent of what we\u2019ve collected. And let me just expand on it for a second if I could. First of all, we\u2019re much better than what the prognosticators - I\u2019ve read some things thinking, well, this is where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re doing better than that. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to air our discussions in the public format. And also, you have to put in mind what percent we collect in April or May. It almost, in a sense, it\u2019s not something overly to focus on because the reality is, we have a lease and they have to pay. So, we don\u2019t have to give semantics. And the way I also think about it, obviously if they decide they are in bankruptcy, then that\u2019s when they get the right to reject a lease. But here is also how I think about, and I just want you to understand this, Alex, say we got 50% and it\u2019s a hypothetical. If I was a retailer and I paid the 50%, I\u2019d be basically upset that there were 50% that didn\u2019t pay on one hand. On the other hand, if I didn\u2019t pay the 50%, I\u2019d almost feel justified in not paying because the reality is, I\u2019ve got another 50% of the retailers that didn\u2019t pay. So, we know what we\u2019re doing here. We will navigate this. It is not easy, but I just think it\u2019s better to have our discussion directly with the retailers. And the bottom line is, we do have a contract and we do expect to get paid. And that I know somehow the market morphed into this number. But the reality is, our business is a lot more complex than some of these others. And remember, our rent roll is - a month of our rental roll is sometimes greater than these guys for the entire year. So, we\u2019re a little more complicated, a little bigger and I think we\u2019re navigating it appropriately. So, again, I wanted to give you context to that and I hope that was helpful. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, David. David E. Simon: I also want to say the only reason I\u2019m yelling is because I\u2019m far away from the speaker in this social distancing, in our board room, for whatever reason the guy put me away from the speaker. Alexander Goldfarb : Can imagine why they did that. David E. Simon: Okay next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Understanding that you have significant liquidity through your cash balance in your expanded credit facility, as you get closer to the expected closing date of the Taubman merger, can you talk about your desire to issue longer term debt? We\u2019ve seen some of the other higher rated REITs access the unsecured bond market. Is that something that you would pursue near-term and where do you think that you could issue that today in terms of accessing permanent capital in this market? David E. Simon: Well, again, I don\u2019t know if you heard my opening remarks, but I... Christy McElroy : I did. David E. Simon: Okay. So, I have nothing to say on the further on Taubman. We\u2019ll let you know when we have information to provide. So, there\u2019s not much more I can say on that front. Christy McElroy : Well, I guess, just in terms of accessing debt capital in this market, have you looked at during the bond deal? David E. Simon: Well, at some point, we\u2019re going to do a bond deal because it\u2019s natural for us to do one every year. So, we\u2019re in a rush to do one. We\u2019re constantly marketing or reviewing the market. We can issue paper, but we\u2019re going to be smart about it. We\u2019re certainly not under the gun to issue any paper. Our ratios are as strong as anybody that\u2019s out there. And we\u2019ll just continue to monitor it. The good news is, the market\u2019s there. And that\u2019s why in a company like ours to have access to both private capital unsecured public debt market, mortgage market have all of those available to us is a real advantage. Christy McElroy : And then your contribution from straight-line rent, it looks like it was down from the recent quarterly run rate. To what extent was that impacted by a write-off of straight-line rent receivables? To what extent have you moved any of your tenants to cash basis accounting? And how are you thinking about that collectability assessment in the current environment versus previously? David E. Simon: Yeah. That\u2019s essentially the new accounting rules that we enacted last year. And we don\u2019t get into specifics about writing off straight-line rent receivables. Brian J. McDade: There wasn\u2019t. David E. Simon: And there wasn\u2019t any. Okay. Christy McElroy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Richard Hill : Hey. Good evening, David. Two questions for me. First, I noticed in your supplement that you did not discuss occupancy costs. So, I was hoping you could maybe update on what you saw in the first quarter. Thomas Ward : 15%. David E. Simon: Brian? Brian J. McDade: It was above 13%. Richard Hill : Thank you. I appreciate it. David E. Simon: Yeah. Richard Hill : Perfect. Thank you very much, Brian. Hey, David, and I wanted to maybe take a bigger picture question. Look, in the past, you\u2019ve been active with retailers both A\u00e9ropostale and Forever 21. There\u2019s obviously some distress in the retail market right now. I can\u2019t help but think that you see this as a medium to long-term opportunity. Could you maybe update us on your thinking on retail investments at this point in time? David E. Simon: Well, look, I think our number one priority, if you saw or you listened to the early the call, I mean, our retailer investments were significantly impacted because of having to close stores. And I mean, the companies Nautica, A\u00e9ropostale and F 21 are in good shape. We have plenty of liquidity to manage the situation. But if not, I mean, our focus is to make sure that they\u2019re doing what they need to do to position their business for profitability. They were not profitable in the first quarter. That\u2019s why we pointed that out, last year was basically breakeven. So, we had basically a $0.06 change year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. I think our focus right now is on, Rich, is on those operations. We\u2019re not going to rule it out. We\u2019re only taking inbound calls. So, if people want us to think about something, we\u2019re happy to do it. But we\u2019re not out there running around soliciting investments. Priority is on what we got across the board, but I\u2019m sure there will be opportunities and we\u2019re in a position to be opportunistic if we think it helps our business. Richard Hill : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just one more quick question if I may. David E. Simon: Sure. Richard Hill : Do you have a sense to pay 100% of your taxable income, what percentage of your rent you need to collect in 2Q? Brian J. McDade: Well, I mean, frankly, we don\u2019t collect a nickel. I mean, but we are, but we don\u2019t - obviously it\u2019s going to impact our taxable income over the year, it\u2019s not a quarter-to-quarter issue. We\u2019re going to make an estimate by basically June-ish, mid-June, what our taxable income looks and we\u2019ll be smarter a month from now and that\u2019s basically why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing. And I think we will have been through most of whatever discussions we\u2019re doing with our retailers. We\u2019ll know at that point how many properties are not open. So, we\u2019ll be able to narrow that down. We have a decent handle on it now, but the fact of the matter is, as long as we declare it in the second quarter I\u2019d rather be smarter on it. And we think another month of making sure we know what\u2019s going to open when, will give us a chance to really fine tune that, and then we\u2019ll go from there. David E. Simon: In our... Richard Hill : All right. David E. Simon: And again, in my text, I gave you an indication of what it won\u2019t be. Okay. So I\u2019m not really certain what it will be, but I gave you a really good hint of what it won\u2019t be. So, I hope you understand that. It\u2019s there for people to consume, I guess. But put yourself in our shoes. I mean, today, we still don\u2019t have half of portfolio up and running. So, it\u2019s a little unusual, but I think in another month or so, we\u2019ll be able to fine tune it. Richard Hill : Got it. David, thank you very much. David E. Simon: Sure. Richard Hill : Good luck. And I hope you and your team and your families are all safe and healthy. David E. Simon: You as well. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael W. Mueller: Yeah, hi. I guess, thanks, first, what are the reopening expectations for the tenants that are on month-to-month leases in carts and kiosks? David E. Simon: I\u2019m sorry, we didn\u2019t get all of it, Mike. Can you - something about... Michael W. Mueller: Yeah. David E. Simon: Say it one more time. Michael W. Mueller: Yeah, I was going to say. Yeah. What are your expectations for the tenants that are on month-to-month leases and them reopening? David E. Simon: Well, most of those are local and entrepreneurs. And actually, I mean that\u2019s the great thing about America. They want to open. They want to go to work. They want to open. We\u2019re very focused on helping them. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ll screw somebody up somewhere just because of our - we won\u2019t do everything perfect, but we\u2019re going to help that group. They want to open. And I\u2019ve been very pleased and our team has been very pleased by the amount of local and month-to-month people that want to open. So, I think that\u2019s their livelihood, and boy, do we appreciate that. And we want them now. Again, some are waiting for PPP and so on and so forth, but pretty good interest on that front. Michael W. Mueller: Got it. And for the centers that you reopened, about what percentage of the tenants opened up as well? David E. Simon: It varies all over the place. And every week, we\u2019ll get better. Again, it was very interesting. I don\u2019t think the community - even though we were trying to keep them up to speed and even though some days we had to change what we thought was going to happen because it changed and there was a very chaotic up and down waiting for governors to order real actions, some doing it, some not doing it, some deferring it to municipalities, I think we managed it as well. I can\u2019t tell you how across the board the many states that really were impressed by our COVID response efforts across the board, and I talked to many governors, many chiefs of staff, and I think it was universal and praise and frankly our team worked very hard to do that. But I think our retail community just was waiting a little bit and now it\u2019s coming, and I\u2019m feeling good about it. But every property is different. I don\u2019t have a number that says, of the 77 here it is, but it\u2019ll get better each week. And the good news is, our department stores - I will tell you, our department stores were actually [ph] Dillard\u2019s (00:35:30) department stores was ready with us. Macy\u2019s is there with us. Belk is opening, Nordstrom is going to be opening in the next few weeks, even Neiman Marcus is opening. So that whole group - Kohl\u2019s, we saw really good reception, communication and wanting to get open. I think I think people want to get open. They want - look, we have a job to do and how we operate differently than what it was a year ago. We understand that, we got to monitor that. But people are ready to open and compete with the broad array of options that the consumer has. The biggest misnomer in this whole thing was that industry was shut down not really, just certain industries were shut down. And I think our folks are ready to compete and we\u2019ll see what happens. Michael W. Mueller: Got it. Thanks, David. David E. Simon: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Linda Tsai : Hi. Given where your stock trades on an implied cap rate basis, what\u2019s your willingness to buy back shares at the current levels? David E. Simon: Well, I think, we\u2019re going to be relatively conservative just given kind of the nature of the pandemic and making sure we get the portfolio open. Look, we did buy shares back in Q1 early, so we believe in our business. We also will say that when we look at what we\u2019re planning to earn and again this is subject to change, but what we\u2019re looking to probably earn this year and next year obviously is subject to fine tuning. We are tremendously undervalued, but we get it right now, we\u2019re going to be conservative and there\u2019s just no reason why we should be trading at this multiple. But we get it and we\u2019ll be conservative and it is what it is. That\u2019s not our primary focus right now. Getting the portfolio open, taking care of our employees, dealing with the retailers and the communities that\u2019s the primary focus. Linda Tsai : That makes sense. And then, I realize you\u2019re doing the bulk of redevelopment spend, but how do you feel about 7% to 9% yields on redevelopments longer term? David E. Simon: Well, I still feel reasonably good that our pipeline that we had was something that would be beneficial to the company and its shareholders. Obviously, we\u2019ve got to see where we are. And we\u2019re still early in this, even though I think we\u2019ve turned the corner because we\u2019re almost half open. But we still got a lot of properties to open. We do think this pandemic will affect certain properties differently. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the Northeast where we don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to open there. And some of those projects that were focused on will be - might change a property. And Oklahoma maybe office since go, a property somewhere else because of various factors we may put on hold for a while. So, it\u2019s really going to be like it always has been, but even more today than ever. It\u2019s going to be really focused on the nature of the particular property, where it\u2019s located, the consumer demographics, all of this stuff is changing and we\u2019ll just have to see it\u2019s also going to be impacted by is it an indoor center or an outdoor center. So, all these things are at least currently with the pandemic, all basically things that we\u2019re going to have to take into account for the future, and things are different. We recognize that. Linda Tsai : Thanks for those additional insight. I just have one last one. What are your expectations for remaining 2020 lease expirations? David E. Simon: Well, I mean, it\u2019s going to be a retailer by retailer. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have some follow-up, but generally we have a prosperous portfolio for the retailer. I think the big issue is, what they estimate their sales to be this year. And obviously, the more they get comfort in that I think that the higher probability that we\u2019ll have the success that we\u2019ve had historically. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David E. Simon: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Derek Johnston : Hi. Hi, everyone. Good evening. So, David, your subsector has endured a heavy toll. And being at-home for a while, I think people probably do want to get out and hopefully shop. So, I mean, the question is, how does your cycle tested keen pull us out of this? And what are the plans to make customers and retailers comfortable, and I guess more importantly excited to get back to malls? David E. Simon: Well, obvious, Derek, when you say subsector, what are you referring to? Derek Johnston : I just mean malls in general, have really taken a heavy stall. David E. Simon: Derek, we are not a mall company. We are predominantly a retail real estate company, but we\u2019re not - I wouldn\u2019t, by any stretch of the imagination, consider us a mall company. So that\u2019s essentially how I would answer. I mean, we are focused on retail real estate, but we are not a mall company, and I think we\u2019ve been consistent on that for years. Derek Johnston : Okay. And second... David E. Simon: And I think the other point on your answer is, I think it\u2019s going to - certain properties in certain areas are going to be just fine you know, and then others might take longer to get up to speed. And indoor, outdoor centers in that are dependent on tourism could be different. I think every property - you cannot, first of all, you got to understand we\u2019re not a mall company. And number one, we\u2019ve never said that even for years and years and years. And number two, every property is going to be somewhat affected differently and the demographics of what happens in that local trade area, is this oil go back up to $50. Again there\u2019s no blanket statement, everything looks really has to be looked at in kind of a regionally and so on. Derek Johnston : Okay. Understood, and thank you. So, a lot of investors are going to bring negative assumptions and speculation from your lack of commentary on the Taubman merger. So, without talking about Taubman at all, what would you say to those investors here and now directly? David E. Simon: I said what I have to say, Derek. Derek Johnston : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Vince Tibone : Hi, good afternoon. What was the rationale for reducing the redevelopment pipeline so drastically? Was it primarily a balance sheet related decision? And how do you think about the impact of taking a pause in redevelopment could have on the long-term positioning on some of these properties? David E. Simon: Well, Vince, believe it or not, I\u2019m a grizzly veteran and I\u2019ve seen - I am proud that we\u2019ve always been able to flip or toggle switch on and off depending upon economic scenarios. And the reality is, we have a great type, it\u2019ll end up being dependent upon the particular property. And we can switch it on completely, also remember that fact is construction was in a lot of places forced to shut down. And we felt it was appropriate to be conservative in the spend. And the reality is, we can turn it off, we can turn it on, we\u2019re never going to get over our seat on that front, as I think about it, we\u2019ll have two or three bigger decisions to make in Q3, Q4 on a couple projects, one internationally, two domestically and the rest of them will restart when we feel good about the environment. Vince Tibone : That makes sense. So, just staying on redevelopment for a second, I mean, how do you see [ph] anchor (00:46:54) redevelopments changing post-COVID and when the economy starts to rebound? Can you just discuss kind of some high-level back selling plan, if there was an acceleration of department store closures? David E. Simon: Well, I mean, this, you guys are smart. I\u2019m not sure I agree with a lot of your research, but I do appreciate you do a great job. What is variable that there will be some and it all depends on the opportunity, it all depends on property-specific information. We do think that department stores still play a meaningful role in a number of properties. They also whether through lease or not, there\u2019s some good real-estate there. And we were, as you know, very focused on redeveloping those boxes that will continue to be a long-term focus for us without question. We have great real estate. We\u2019re more than a mall company, and the ability to redevelop our great real estate is a hallmark of this company and something we will continue. There\u2019s nothing wrong, we\u2019ve taken a pause while we sort our way through a pandemic and we\u2019ve dealt with a lot, I honestly say, I haven\u2019t dealt with this, but we\u2019re back up and running almost half the portfolio. We\u2019re feeling good about what we\u2019ve done, feel good about the balance sheet, feel good about our people and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. And again, I think the ability to redevelop real estate that we get back will be an important component of what we do to add value going forward. So, we\u2019re not deterred by the current events, but we\u2019re taking a pause as it sorts its way through. Vince Tibone : Okay. That makes senses. Appreciate the color. David E. Simon: No worries. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. You\u2019ve been opened for two weekends. I wonder if you could comment on how consumers are being received by the different formats, outlet, malls, whatever and by the different geographies. David E. Simon: Well, I would certainly say, outdoor centers feel a little bit more comfortable. And I, obviously, would say that the states that we\u2019re opening that it is so dependent upon the kind of the states and where things are. And generally, the suburban outside kind of the major dense areas seem to be doing better. I do think there\u2019s pent up demand. I\u2019d say the consumer is probably a little more moderate as opposed to high-end. Regarding our outlets, we\u2019re seeing some really good traction with some of the higher-end brands as they sell their goods. So, I do think that maybe from a moderate customer that\u2019s having the ability to shop there. But it\u2019s a little early to say that some of our good bread and butter states, we feel pretty encouraged by. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then I just wondered if there were any plans to expand or extend curbside shopping helping the consumers transition to shopping in-store again. David E. Simon: Well, sure. I mean, in some cases that\u2019s all that you can do. And we\u2019re there to help the retailer if they need our help. But in a lot of cases, they\u2019ve already have their own protocols. So, look, I think it\u2019s helpful and beneficial, but it\u2019s more important ultimately for us to get our properties open fully. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. R. Jeremy Metz : Hey, thank you. David, I was hoping you can maybe discuss the reduction in the operating costs a little more in terms of what you\u2019ve been able to do and if you can quantify the actual savings that you expect here on the full year of operations versus maybe your initial budget? And along those same lines with most of your tenants on fixed cam reimbursement, is there any carry through there or no and maybe you can just also quantify the reduction in the corporate spending just help us get a better feel to what that actually looks like? Thanks. David E. Simon: Yeah. Jeremy, as you know we went through guidance so we really can\u2019t do that. But obviously when your property is not allowed to operate and open and we have the ability to reduce all sorts of costs and that\u2019s really on one hand, on the other hand if you take and if you see in our protocols and we do open, we\u2019re going to have an additional cost of running the centers. And it\u2019s hard for me to give you a number because the reality is I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to be able to open the entire portfolio. But as soon as we do that we\u2019ll try to give you the new normal. But when we are opening, we are one shift. So that does save us. I\u2019m hopeful that at some point we will come away with that because that\u2019s a good sign, but we\u2019re not quite there yet. But when we do open, we have extra maintenance cleaning et cetera. So there\u2019s so many variables right now it\u2019s just I can\u2019t really do it and it\u2019s hard to do it right now without knowing when the entire system opens up and how it opens up and what our restrictions are going to be. By the way we don\u2019t think they should be just to be go on the record, we do think we should be able to be open. We have terrific protocols. They are as good as any of our other competitors which are the online only operators and the big boxes and so on that continue to operate. We have the same distancing. We\u2019re limiting the amount of personnel. We\u2019re handing out mask. We\u2019re doing everything that all of the other competitors are doing including the major online competitors. So, we do think, we should hope - I mean, I want to go on record saying that and we do think we should calibrate that obviously. We\u2019re prepared to operate clearly within any government protocols but we do feel like we should open. And that clearly our outdoor centers should clearly open, but main event, I just can\u2019t give you the number because I don\u2019t really know when we\u2019re opening. We are saving some money but as we get open a lot of that will go back into the property to maintain the protocols that we\u2019re helping to - what we\u2019re doing our share in those communities. I hope the communities appreciate what we\u2019re doing. I hope they appreciate what we do not only in sales tax, but in property tax. My favorite obviously is in Long Island, where I won\u2019t name them all but we can probably in total over $60 million in property taxes for a couple of properties. My guess is, with right protocols, we ought to get a chance to see what we can do especially as our competitors are open and selling stuff that\u2019s clearly more than non-essential. A long-winded answer to your answer to your very straight forward question, which is I can\u2019t really give you that, okay. R. Jeremy Metz : I think that\u2019s fair. And just are you willing to comment on the employee side as you\u2019ve reopened properties and taken employees off furlough? Have you seen any attrition or employees simply not returning and that\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of percolated out there as a possible concern? David E. Simon: Yeah. Listen, I think just the whole employee thing, even in the - when I went back to Indianapolis, was 1990. And obviously retail real estate - that was a serious recession, and we had to go through very painful downsizing. This is since that, basically 30 years ago, we\u2019ve never really had a reduction in force even in the recession. The Great Recession in 2008-2009, we didn\u2019t have a reduction in force. So, we went through that. I feel personally terrible for it. And then, you couple that with the furlough that we had to do. So, just a very painful scenario. And I do think, as soon as we get our system open, I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019re going to call as many people back as we can from furlough, I hope they - not that they should, but I hope they at least can understand why we did what we had to do and I hope they do come back. I do think we\u2019ve been pretty good so far on what we\u2019ve opened. And I think as our level of activity increases, we\u2019re going to bring as many folks back as we can. We did have a permanent reduction in force. We do not plan on bringing those folks back. And obviously that\u2019s not something we wanted to do. I didn\u2019t think I had to do that again. We built this company not to do that, but we felt like we had to do that. And I apologize to the folks that were impacted by it. There\u2019s no good excuse. R. Jeremy Metz : Yeah. No. And the second one for me, just a little more positive, to go back to your opening comments about innovation coming to mind the last few weeks. Maybe you can just expand a little bit more what that means, what you\u2019re doing differently? And then just what else maybe bigger picture you\u2019re looking to do as you start to think about potential changes to the model and how to adapt your centers and curate them possibly differently including just you were going down the path of adding some mixed use. Does this change that aspect at all, or just too early to make some of those calls? Thanks, Dave. David E. Simon: No. As I mentioned earlier, Jeremy, I do think the whole redevelopment of our properties will continue to be very important. I would look at what we\u2019re doing now as a pause making sure that we have a better feel for the landscape. And the fact is, you can\u2019t redevelop anything if you can\u2019t open your property. Okay? So, please understand we\u2019re still confronted with that dilemma. I think we\u2019ve just been so innovative on how we opened the portfolio. I mean, the ability to do what we did as fast as we did as high level as we did. I don\u2019t think anybody really could appreciate that in scale and scope. I think and what we\u2019re trying to do with our retailers again, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a difference of opinion on that. But what we\u2019re trying to do in terms of listening to what their issues are, maybe not agreeing, but certainly trying to have a constructive dialogue, segmenting the retailers out in various categories, putting the right people involved. Again, we\u2019re not going to bat 1.000, we\u2019re going to have some conflicts because we do believe in our contracts. But we\u2019re clearly trying to do that innovatively, we\u2019re really focused on the local community trying to be innovative there and then just listening to consumer on what we can do and learn from there. And then I think technology will be added to our properties to enhance the consumer experience and certainly to keep them safe. So, there\u2019s a lot more to come, but we are basically eight weeks into this, right, almost eighth week. Brian J. McDade: Yeah. David E. Simon: And we\u2019re learning a lot and doing a lot. I expect that to continue. R. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good afternoon. So, David, whether a mall or a retail real estate center is open or not, one of the challenges that you face is just diminished capacity, right, just less traffic than normal. So, I\u2019m just curious conceptually, I don\u2019t really care about the April or May rent collection, but just conceptually how are you thinking about what rents should be during this kind of transitional phase? And is your approach more along the lines of A, if the city is open and the mall is opened safely, rent is due or something a little bit more accommodating? David E. Simon: Well, again, I think the short answer is, I think I\u2019ve addressed a lot of this, but the short answer is, it\u2019s very much a property by property and a retail by retail process that we go through. We use the judgment that we\u2019ve had 60 years of experience. We will not always get it right, but we try to rely on that. We also, from the retailer, how they\u2019re treating us. I mean, it\u2019s a two-way street. And we try to put it in a blender and find out a solution. I\u2019m hopeful we can do that, but there\u2019s no guarantee that that we can. And I think the receptivity from our properties is really going to be, I mean, I do think it\u2019s going to be a lot of it will depend on the consumer demographics and where that property is, and what the psyche of that consumer really has been affected. I can assure you at least based on what I\u2019m seeing that in certain properties that reopen, the psyche of that consumer hasn\u2019t really been affected. It may be affected elsewhere. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And you\u2019ve talked about the benefits of the [ph] finance (01:05:09) platform and the scale that you have and how much of an advantage it is. Just broadly speaking, do you think in this type of environment where there\u2019s going to be some economic challenges, companies that don\u2019t have the same scale, may be smaller, could be disproportionately impacted? David E. Simon: Yes, without question. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to this topic of rent deferrals. I mean, you do in the 10-K disclose that you have given some rent deferrals, you\u2019re not saying what they were or not, but I guess I\u2019m just wondering what drove the decision to do rent deferrals, which you did do some so far versus conversations that you still have with tenants where you haven\u2019t made a decision yet what the outcome is going to be? David E. Simon: Well, it\u2019s a retailer by retailer discussion. I mean, we went out our way knowing the extraordinary changes that this pandemic has created. And given our financial wherewithal, we went out of the way to offer deferral for a lot of our retailers. And we felt that was we had the balance sheet and the cash flow and everything else to do it and we just felt it was the right thing to do. Even though there\u2019s nothing in the contract that alleviates their contractual life to pay rent in the 95% trial of our leases. So, we just felt like we can help, simple as that. Nicholas Yulico : And in terms of just going back to the timing of, I think you said by the time June comes around, the board is going to have more information on taxable income, other items I guess about ultimate collection of rents. How much though is that going to depend on the reopening of your centers? And I guess, as well how much of your - if you had already given some deferrals, I mean, how much of the portfolio is kind of in question right now in terms of where ultimate rent collection is going to be and why is it that when you get to June you think you\u2019re going to have, the board is going to have more confidence in ultimately where your income may settle out this year? David E. Simon: Well, I mean, because the reality for opening centers now which was the first hurdle will know, every week we\u2019re all opening more centers. We\u2019ll make further progress on where we are with our retailers. At the amount of information that I have today versus what I had a month ago is exponentially high. I would expect the same thing to occur. And it\u2019s the most thoughtful thing to do since it will still be declared in our second quarter is to have another month of information or thereabouts on all the factors that go into our taxable income. And again, I mean, I indicated earlier I don\u2019t know if you listened to my opening remarks where we think it is today, but another month, five weeks from now or no more, not that complicated. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Wes Golladay : Hi, guys. Just have a few quick modeling questions. First one is, you have much exposure to hotels. I imagine it\u2019s pretty small, but with RevPAR down 90%, it might start to show up in the numbers. David E. Simon: Very small, the ones that we do have are not open. I think one is actually, but yeah it\u2019s very small, very small. Wes Golladay : Yeah. Okay. And then going into your accounting expertise here, now that the pipeline is smaller, will you be capitalizing cost going forward or with the projects in a suspension mode, can you still capitalize the costs? David E. Simon: Well, you can\u2019t capitalize the cost if it\u2019s suspended. It\u2019s not going to be a material change one way or another. Brian J. McDade: Wes, you would keep capitalizing costs on those projects that are still active as of right now. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thank you very much. David E. Simon: No worries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Jason Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman with Christy. David, I think we all want to know how you do the homeschooling rather than what you\u2019re doing on the business side. David E. Simon: Homeschooling? Michael Jason Bilerman : Yeah. What you\u2019re doing - how you are as a teacher rather than you are as a CEO? David E. Simon: That\u2019s very good. I\u2019m not sure what I do well. Okay. Michael Jason Bilerman : So, as you think about on the dividend, can you talk about the June making decision, why not wait until the end of the year because it\u2019s an annual election on the quarterly election and sort of figure out when all said and done, because I don\u2019t think any of us know the depths and lengths of this pandemic and things we could get a resurgence in the fall. We may get a resurgence from all the re-openings right now. So, why not wait until there is perfect clarity for annual taxable income? David E. Simon: Well, I think, we\u2019ll be in a pretty good spot. I mean, we\u2019re bucketing it now. We just want to reaffirm our buckets and get more information. I want to - you did say something about our openings unequivocally, you\u2019re not going to increase in my opinion the potential spread of COVID. And communities may go up, but don\u2019t blame - unless you have science, don\u2019t blame it, don\u2019t blame our openings on an increase and that community is COVID. I\u2019m not sure that I would create that causation, okay. Michael Jason Bilerman : No, I\u2019m not saying if your asset... David E. Simon: I guess, you said something and I just wanted to make it clear. Michael Jason Bilerman : No, I was saying just generally, yeah. Generally... David E. Simon: Yeah, generally. Okay, look, I think it\u2019s possible, right. I mean, there could be markets where there is a spike and it\u2019s reduced, but I mean, common sense would indicate we\u2019re just going to have to figure out how to live with this threat for a while. And again, I mean, I\u2019m not in-charge, but we\u2019ll do what we need to do. And if there\u2019s better technology or if there\u2019s a better idea, our protocols and I said to state, municipalities and we study what everybody is doing but the reality is if there\u2019s a better way to do what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ll do it. That\u2019s simple. And because it will change, I mean, there will be better protocols than what we initially set forth. Michael Jason Bilerman : Right. David E. Simon: But, Michael, look, I think it\u2019s important to the best in the community to do the core - I mean, it goes back to your first part. I mean, I do think it\u2019s good to have a quarterly cadence. We\u2019re in a position financially to do that. And the reality is, we think it\u2019s the right thing to do just to fine tune it, get more data over the next four to five weeks and go from there. Michael Jason Bilerman : Right. And pay it in cash greater than 50% of where it was before, which was in your opening comments. David E. Simon: Well, I think we said, we won\u2019t be like probably by the time it\u2019s June, it\u2019ll be over 200. I said it won\u2019t be at least 200 companies that will be less than 50% based on what we know today on our modeling. So, I will pay it in cash and we\u2019re going to pay our taxable income and we\u2019re not going to do that weird stuff that whatever they call it, what do they call it, I think the strangling of one tax year to the next. Michael Jason Bilerman : As you think about going into this pandemic, obviously the retailers a number of them were struggling. And I think one of the frustrations you had was on the e-commerce businesses that a lot of these retailers are operating were generated a lot of the sales by your assets. And so, while the sales didn\u2019t take place at your mall or outlet or mill center, they were developed from that interaction. As you think about where we are today with most of the retailers not having access to their store front, obviously the e-com activities are growing pretty substantially in getting a lot bigger adoption by consumers. Is there an opportunity as you go forward in these restructurings or deferrals or whatever you\u2019re dealing with your tenants to restructure all of the leases with the retailers to bring things to sort of the current marketplace relative to when those leases were first signed? David E. Simon: Well, look, I think that, let\u2019s just say this. The internet for retail whether it\u2019s a marketplace or direct-to-consumer or any other method is a big competitor to our entire industry. It is part of our industry. And we always have to compete with it. And our greatest asset is the physical one and service, and those kind of things. And we will have to see how that evolves. I do think a number of retailers are frankly shipping right now even if we\u2019re in a place where we\u2019re not allowed to operate, a lot of retailers were accessing their store and shipping directly from that store. So, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens with that even though we were not able to operate, they\u2019re in their operating, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re social distancing and all that stuff. But there\u2019re in their operating selling e-commerce. So, look, it is the internet certainly it would be hard to intellectually argue that it\u2019s this scenario has increased adoption for it and though we compete, we\u2019ll figure out how to compete. The stores are important to the retailers that have both. And I think that will remain the same. I do think perhaps there is some thinking out there that they don\u2019t need as big a storefront or store network. I think that could backfire on them in the long run because it\u2019s kind of out of sight, out of mind. Michael Jason Bilerman : Yeah. David E. Simon: And but we\u2019ll see. I am sure there will be some retailers that will get the sense that the fleet, the store network is not as important as it was three months ago. Michael Jason Bilerman : Right. David E. Simon: I think that - we\u2019ll see how that shakes out, and what role we can play in that. I think they might be making a wrong decision, but that\u2019s not for me to say. That\u2019s just my own instinct. Michael Jason Bilerman : I mean, look, do you hear about people saying with office space we now have to go back to the office. There\u2019s not going to be any stores. So, I don\u2019t see us being in our homes 100% of the time working and shopping. I do think we live in a society that crave some of that. But there\u2019s going to be significant change as we come through this because a lot of your tenants unfortunately don\u2019t have the wherewithal to get through, a lot of tenants just don\u2019t have the wherewithal whether they\u2019re office tenants living in an apartment, I mean it\u2019s a real recession going on. And so, it\u2019s just getting from point A to point B. David E. Simon: We are clearly aware of that for sure. Michael Jason Bilerman : Yeah. Last question and I get your comment. No comment, status update from Tom, and the question I have is, why? So what is the rationale? You don\u2019t have a shareholder vote. So, I didn\u2019t think there would be anything restrictive on that. You talked a lot about the decisive actions you\u2019re taking, immediate actions you\u2019re taking, aggressive actions that you\u2019ve taken to protect your enterprise. Why not mention anything about pretty sizable deal that you entered into where there is a proxy upstanding? What\u2019s the rationale for not providing any updates? David E. Simon: Look, Michael, the only reason why I let you get back on the call is because you make me laugh and you\u2019re a good guy, but the reality is I\u2019ve already answered this question. And do you have anything else let me know. Michael Jason Bilerman : Right. No, it was just more so I didn\u2019t want to get - I just didn\u2019t know if there was a legal reason why, that\u2019s the only thing I didn\u2019t know if it was a legality thing you can speak about it, that\u2019s why I asked in that way. A - David E. Simon: Michael Jason Bilerman : All right. I appreciate the time, David, as always. David E. Simon: Thank you. Be well. Michael Jason Bilerman : You too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good evening out there. Thanks for accommodating my question. David what can you tell us, what update can you provide us on Forever 21 specifically. I understand your earlier comments on liquidity and you\u2019re not making any new retail level investments here, but I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve been investing capital today in the Forever 21 platform specifically for the long-term is still worthwhile in this environment? David E. Simon: We actually capitalize it pretty reasonably well. So we\u2019re in good shape right now and there\u2019s no need for additional capital. So obviously it\u2019s important for them to get the stores up and running and operating, but it\u2019s between us and our partners of Authentic Brands group in Brookfield, we\u2019re in pretty good shape to weather the storm. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Helpful. What can you tell us about the Carson outlet joint venture project you have with Macerich? I understand it\u2019s a bit of a court battle with the city going on there and that the project you did is in bit of a standstill. But I\u2019m curious if you think the project is on in the future and if you still be willing to pursue this project once normalcy return to the world and it might be a project you\u2019d be willing to pursue on your own if need be? David E. Simon: Well, look, the only - since it\u2019s in litigation, I really can\u2019t comment, but I encourage you to read the complaint that we and Macerich filed against the agency. And... Haendel St. Juste: Okay. David E. Simon: And it\u2019s all, I mean, it\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s all spelled out and plenty of time is passed. This was - this has nothing to do with the pandemic. This was going on for several months, but I encourage you to read the complaint. It\u2019s all spelled out black and white lots of pictures too. I think the colored actually I\u2019m not even sure but some are colored. Okay. Haendel St. Juste: Sure. Sure. We\u2019ve taken a look. We\u2019re just curious if there is something that perhaps has a long term future. But I understand what\u2019s going on. So, lastly how should we think - I\u2019m wondering, I guess, how your redevelopment approach overall might change your post COVID 19, are going to require more of a premium spread that the yield spread versus the cap rates even matter. And any thoughts on what a more appropriate measure or how you would focus quantitatively in determining which project to pursue versus the others? David E. Simon: Well, I mean it\u2019s a lot of it\u2019s based on our years of experience in judgment. It\u2019s interesting, the cap rates matter. That\u2019s a very good question. Okay. Put that aside. We look at return on investment and obviously if it\u2019s too low you\u2019re not creating any value for the shareholders. So cap rates are and are not necessarily a science. We tend to look on return on equity, return on investment. But look I think right now we\u2019re just we\u2019re focused on finishing what\u2019s really almost ready to complete. We have and then we\u2019re focused obviously on getting our portfolio up and running and that those are the priorities right now. Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Thank you. David E. Simon: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. David E. Simon: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate your allowing us to move the call. We changed it up because we have our shareholder meeting tomorrow.

For prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good evening and thank you for joining us this evening. Before I turn to our second quarter results, I really just want to again express my gratitude to the entire Simon team for their tireless work they continue to do for our shoppers, communities, and retailers. As we said previously, the safety of our communities in which we serve is our top priority, and the team has managed unprecedented circumstances in dealing with the pandemic, certain recent natural disasters, obviously the unfortunate rioting that also occurred. So we've been dealing with obviously a lot. And frankly I'm extremely proud, grateful for the dedication and commitment of our team as they've demonstrated during these challenging times, from opening \u2013 from closing to opening to securing our buildings. They've done a heck of a job. So let's go to the numbers. Second quarter reported funds from operation was $746.5 million, or $2.12 per share. I'm pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the solid profitability and positive cash flow we achieved in the second quarter. Keep in mind, please, our profitability was achieved despite our US portfolio being closed to the public for nearly 10,500 shopping days during the second quarter. Our domestic and international operations in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.13 per diluted share primarily due to reduced lease income and ancillary property revenues as a result of the COVID-19 disruption, partially offset by approximately $0.36 per diluted share from cost reduction initiatives or a net $0.77 per diluted share in the second quarter. Now, let me walk you through the components of the year-over-year change in the context of our portfolio NOI. I think the best way to do that is on page 17 of our supplement that we issued today. This will help you understand the impact of COVID-19. First of all, total portfolio NOI or net operating income decreased from $1.5 billion in the second quarter last year to approximately $1.2 billion this year, a decrease of 21%, or approximately $315 million. The year-over-year decline for the second quarter was due primarily to the following : approximately $215 million from domestic rent abatements and a higher provision for credit losses. Given the lack of local, state and federal government support for our industry, we went out of our way to abate rent for thousands of local small businesses, entrepreneurs and restaurateurs and other retailers for the period they were closed. Approximately $145 million from lower sales based rents, short-term leasing and Simon brand venture income solely due to the fact that our properties were closed and approximately $60 million of lower income from our international outlet portfolio, again due to the fact that they were closed as well during the second quarter. So that's $215 million, $145 million and $60 million, these decreases were partially offset by approximately $105 million from our cost reduction initiatives. As a reminder the variances I just explained do not include the negative impact of $36 million from a straight line increase deduction \u2013 straight line impact has always been excluded from portfolio NOI. Our operating statistics metrics were as follows, Mall and Premium outlet occupancy at quarter-end was 92.9%, down approximately 110 basis points from the first quarter of 2020, standard bankruptcies and lower specialty leasing during the second quarter due to COVID-19 impacted occupancy approximately 60 basis points. Average base minimum rent was $56.02, up 2.8% year-over-year and our leasing spreads were essentially flat for the trailing 12-month period. Now regarding collections. We have collected from our US retail portfolio including some level of rent deferrals approximately 51% of our contractual build rent for April and May combined, approximately 69% for June and approximately 73% for July with only de minimis deferrals. These percentages are not reduced for any of abatement granted during the period that I previously talked about. Now prior to reopening our properties, we implemented a series of robust safety protocols to ensure the highest possible safety and cleanliness standards. We reopened our US properties starting in early May. And our entire portfolio for July 10 has permitted even with the ever-changing governmental orders that frankly have been in a constant state of flux in 37 states and 150 different counties all with different protocols. On July 15th, the California Governor issued a new restrictive order requiring us to close seven of our properties in the state. So we're all open except for the seven recent closings in California. We've been generally encouraged by the shopper response to our reopening particularly in certain locations where there's been a steady improvement in traffic with many tenants reporting sales better than their initial expectations. Just a little color on that and the centers that reopened in early May, tenants who reported sales, reported May was approximately 50% of their previous year volume for the same period. And in June, that increased to more than 80% of prior-year volumes. Tenants continued to reopen, and we currently had 91% of all tenants, or nearly 23,000 tenants across our US portfolio are open and operating. Of the remaining tenants that have not opened \u2013 not reopened, more than half of those are closed because of the remaining restrictive governmental orders limiting or prohibiting their operations. Included in that category would be movie theaters, fitness facilities and, in some instances, restaurants. Internationally, all of our designer and international premium outlets are open and operating. 100% of all those stores and our designer outlets are open and operating with shopper traffic and retail sales at approximately 90% of prior-year levels. And we continue to see steady improvement in traffic and sales at our international premium outlets with all retail stores open and sales across that portfolio nearing last year's levels. With our partner, Siam Piwat, we opened Siam Premium Outlets in Bangkok, our first Premium Outlet Center in Thailand. The center is approximately 90% leased. It's extremely well located and has an unrivalled premium shopping experience featuring leading brands such as Burberry, Balenciaga, Coach, Ferragamo, and many more. We also completed several redevelopments, including phase IV of Gotemba Premium Outlets, which is 100% leased. Gotemba Premium Outlets is the largest outlet center in Asia ex-China, and we project annual retail sales to be in excess of $1 billion. Our net investment focus continues to be on those projects nearing completion, and our share of the remaining net cash funding required to complete the projects currently under construction is approximately $140 million through 2021. We have a track record on capitalizing on various value-creating opportunities. As you know, Sparc Group, our 50/50 joint venture with Authentic Brands Group, submitted stalking horse bids to acquire Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brand jeans under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Just a few things, I think is really important to keep in mind on this potential deal. First, Sparc is buying them out of bankruptcy, so it is acquiring the inventory at or below cost, and to the extent we buy the intellectual property, we are doing so at attractive values. Second, when Sparc integrates acquisitions in its platform, it reduces the acquired companies overhead significantly. And third, Sparc is able \u2013 because of the bankruptcy code and designation rights, able to reject any leases that do not meet its criteria. And all stores are projected to have a four-wall EBITDA upon assumption of lease. These investments are expected to generate positive EBITDA. Soon after their integration in the Sparc we expect any equity investments should be returned within a year after integration of operations. And as I have mentioned previously, we have created real value already in our investments in Sparc and of course ABG and we continue to look forward to other opportunities. Just a few words on the balance sheet, again active. As you might imagine, at the end of the quarter, our liquidity was approximately $8.5 billion consisting of $4.9 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity and $3.6 billion of cash including our share of joint venture cash. As a reminder, the $8.5 billion of liquidity is net of the $700 million of US commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we paid down a total of $2 5 billion under our credit facilities. We also completed the optional redemption at par of $500 million in 2.5% notes and \u20ac370 million in 2.3% notes. Both of those notes had maturity dates later this year. And I'm also pleased to note that our net debt has not increased by the end of the second quarter through this pandemic period. So, important to note, and our debt covenants remain well above the required levels with significant headroom. As you know, dividend we paid, our second quarter dividend of $1.30 per share in cash on July 24. The board will declare third quarter dividend by September 30, and we expect in total for 2020 to pay at least $6 per share in cash for dividends. Conclusion would be simply, again, I want to thank my colleagues for their continued resolve during this tragic set of events for the entire country. Our results are only possible through the ongoing ingenuity, flexibility and dogged determination of the Simon team. We're proud to play our small part in helping local small businesses, entrepreneurs and communities work their way through this recovery by continuing to help them get back so that they can open their business and move forward. So with that, we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. First question we have on the line will be coming from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening, everyone. I guess as of August 9 you mentioned 91% of tenants were reopened but then July collection was around 73%. So just wondering if you could go through kind of why that amount isn't closer to 91%. Obviously it's better than the previous few months and how quickly you think you could get to a point where rents being paid is more similar to the amount of stores open? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, July is at 73% and why because certain tenants haven't pay rent. They have contracts they're obligated to but certain tenants haven't paid. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And I just \u2013 when you think you about the amount that hasn't yet paid, I know, on the May call you had a good sense of just kind of making that point that those who have leases unless their bankrupt you expect them to be paying. So, I guess could you just go through the status of the portion from Q2 that weren't paid whether it sounds like there are minimal amounts of abatements kind of what portion is still under discussion versus rent deferrals you did give or other categories? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, as you might imagine we're in active negotiations with all of our retailers. We did provide abatement for primarily the local businesses, and entrepreneurs, restauranteurs during the abatement period, so \u2013 or I'm sorry, the closure period. And we're finalizing a number of our remaining open issues with our retailers. Again, I mentioned to you that we took a hit of $215 million, which is a combination of abatements and write-offs from bankrupt tenants, et cetera. We're not going to go through the percentages of each category primarily because we're still in active negotiations with tenants regarding April-May, and we don't think \u2013 that information, we believe, is proprietary, and it puts us in a awkward position as we finalize our negotiation. We've done over 9,000 amendments. I think we're in very good shape. We're certainly pretty much on -for not being essential, remember, we were deemed, for whatever reason, non-essential retail. So we lost 10,500 shopping days, and we're going through an orderly process. So we've taken the hit that we think is going to show up in Q2, and we're processing the balance but hopefully that will all be behind us here in the near future. We're making very good progress on, as I mentioned in July, being at over 73%. But we still got retailers that we need to deal with, and we're going through the process in an orderly, thoughtful fashion, like we do everything else. Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon out there. David, how are you? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Out here is going to be the resurgence of the Midwest is around the corner, my friend, okay? So just remember that. Go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: By the way, careful what you look for because all the fleeing New Yorkers will end up moving in next door to you in Carmel. So just be careful what you wish for about the Midwest. So two questions. Just following up on Caitlin's, I understand your hesitation but still, if we look at your accounts receivable, it definitely jumped from first quarter to second quarter meaningfully. So it sounds like you probably had not that much straight line rent write-offs and you think that most of this is money good. So is there a way for one... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: But also remember that's quarter-end. A lot of collections. We made a lot of collections in July applying to Q2. And so just that's a moment in time you got to be very careful about drawing any conclusion. But again \u2013 and we're continuing to obviously finish a number of deals. So just don't \u2013 you can't go from that point to the other point without knowing this isn't \u2013 everyday, it changes. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. But still can you just give us some flavor even without the numbers but just like percentages, just some color. You had a bunch of tenants who \u2013 people weren't paying. Then people started to pay. Your tenants who asked you for, hey, can we make a deal? Some of those were flat out rejected, some you worked with, some you obviously have brought to court. But can you just give us a flavor like on the shopping center side, they've been pretty detailed as far as the percentages of who've asked, percentage of asked versus who's abated, who deferral and the amounts that they've said no and the amount that are remaining to be negotiated with. So can you at least give some framework around that just to help us understand better? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I guess, Alex, I have such a different philosophical difference. For me to air my \u2013 let's just think hypothetical. Let's say I deferred half a guy's rent and the guy that I didn't defer any rent, and I told you I deferred half his rent, he's going to end up saying why didn't you do this for me when you did it for other people. So I think this is proprietary information. Obviously, all of this flows through our income statement. It's all GAAP. We did tell you we took a bunch of abatements and we did have a negative $36 million straight line rent variance. Again that's not in that $215 million because portfolio NOI as you know we always excluded straight line. But in this case this is the first quarter we've ever had negative straight line as far as I can tell, so it's a pretty big gap. But I don't \u2013 I just don't want to kind of go through that beyond what we've told you. I mean, we told you collections. We told you, we did do some level of deferrals, nothing out of the ordinary. The deferrals in July were de minimis. Deferrals in June were less than April and May. So it's all moving in the right direction, and the collections are \u2013 we haven't given up on April-May as Q2 collections. We expect to \u2013 other than what we abated and wrote off through bankruptcy, we expect to reach a deal on the vast majority of it. And you're right. Some of \u2013 we have a one really big receivable out there that is of public record. And obviously that's out there as a big receivable. We think that's going to get collected, but that's a big increase in our accounts receivable. So the deferrals and the abatements were clearly under \u2013 not anywhere near the majority of our rental rent roll, and we still have what I'd say about 28% to 30% of our negotiations still to be done. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. That's helpful, the 28% still to be done. Okay. And then the... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Still to be done. Yeah. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: 28% still to be done. Okay. The second question is... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And that's moving down. I'm looking at some numbers here. We've got 20% in July that's still under negotiation. But at the end of the day, we expect roughly, with abatements and everything else, to collect 85% roughly of Q2 and 93% of July and then hopefully get back to kind of the normal run rate which has been in the 97%, 98% level. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay The second question is from \u2013 your hallmark apart from cash flow is your balance sheet. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: And I see that a few of the rating agencies I think have you guys on negative, but you're doing a lot more with ABG. Obviously, there's litigation with Taubman. There was the discussion in the Journal today with Amazon. I'll let someone else ask that question. And then you did continue to pay a dividend, albeit at a reduced level, but still you're paying still with a hefty dividend. How do the rating agencies view all of these transactions? Have they viewed all of these as favorable or they're comfortable or have you had to alter some of your plans based on your desire which I assume is to maintain your current rating? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. We're not concerned about that. I mean, just even with all of the closures, again 10,000 days, we were cash flow positive this quarter. Now, we were obviously aggressive in our \u2013 not many folks that I've read have shared their reductions in costs, but we took out $105 million of costs across corporate in the portfolio, but we're cash flow positive. Our ratios are \u2013 our covenants are well-covered. And again, I mean, I see the narrative out there. The amount of equity in both the Lucky and Brooks Brothers investments is \u2013 I don't want to say de minimis, but it's what would make \u2013 what would you think would be a non-event from our standpoint in terms of what we have to invest either directly or in Sparc? What would you say, Alex? Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: In the two, I'm going to guess maybe at $100 million, maybe $100 million to $150 million in aggregate between the two. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. It's going to be half of that. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. So $75 million between the two? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, no, no. I'd say half of the $100 million. Okay. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And that's only in a short period of time until we refinance the whole thing. And again \u2013 remember when you buy the inventory at cost or below and then you sell it for a gross margin which you're supposed to, we're not buying it at retail. We're buying at cost. So if you have a 35%, 40% gross margin, you're going to make 35%, 40% on your \u2013 we're not buying the inventory at a retail cost to the consumer. We're buying it at basically the cost that the retailer has and then we sell it. So there's profit in there. That's why people \u2013 that's why you see ABL financed left and right because they're buying at a cost and there is a gross margin in there. So that's where the market doesn't really get it but those two investments either directly or through capital contribution to Sparc will be $150 million from us. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There's just no way and let me repeat, no way that the rating agencies are going to think twice about it, no way. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Right. But JCPenney would be different. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, again, I'm not going to respond to market rumors or speculation. But what's out there in the public is that Penney is likely, if they are to restructure to do an Opco/Propco and the amount of equity required to do the operating company is going to be a lot less than you would think. So, again, it's not overly complicated but there are facts that just aren't out there that if we thought, first of all Lucky and Brooks Brothers to the extent that we get this \u2013 and by the way, the one thing we should talk about is the fact that we're saving in the case of Brooks Brothers 4,000 jobs, okay? I mean, that's what we should talk about. I mean, we're doing our fair share for trying to keep this world as normal as we can. But going back, I mean, if Brooks Brothers or Lucky or even Sparc or even ABG were material to our financial situation then we would disclose it but it's not material. It's a sideline business and I do see the narrative that and I don't buy into this, and, Alex, you and I have had this discussion \u2013 that we're buying into these retailers to pay us rent. We're doing it because we, for one reason only, we believe in the brand, and we think we can make money. If we didn't believe in the brand and we didn't think we could make money, we wouldn't do it. And if \u2013 those same people are probably the same people that told Amazon to stay just in the book business, okay? So, let's just think a little bit \u2013 there's just nothing out there that says you can't make smart investments outside of your core businesses which is what we do all the time. And, look, Kimco did it with Albertsons. They did a pretty damn good job, and kudos to them. Alexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Thank you, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, David. Good afternoon. Hey, I wanted to maybe just chat with you about the return to normal from a cash flow standpoint, obviously something you focus on a lot. And in many respects, this environment is different from the GFC given the headwinds facing retail real estate before thinking about the implications of COVID-19. But I'm sure there's some lessons learned from the GFC as well, and you were obviously very successful in navigating the GFC. So I think what a lot of us are trying to understand is what does that return to normal look like? And you mentioned, when speaking to Alex, rent collections in the high 90s relatively soon. But like when does cash flow, from the way you look at it, return to where it was last year? How long does it take to get there? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's a fair question and a good question. But I don't have an answer. Look, I do think without question, the pandemic has obviously had a dramatic impact much greater \u2013 and I've experienced a lot of volatility in my career. The Great Recession frankly doesn't \u2013 it pales in comparison to what we're dealing with. Obviously, the amount of bankruptcies in our sector is tremendous and it's more reminiscent to me of what we're dealing with, of what we dealt with in the early 1090s than the Great Recession. And frankly the early 1990s took some time. I mean, it was \u2013 and again, if I say something you're going to think I'm saying something but I'm just using that as an example. I mean in the early 1990s, the real estate recession there took frankly two, three, four years to overcome. And again, I'm not making that prediction here, but I don't think it's going to be an immediate snapback. That doesn't mean our company can do great work. The important player in getting the country back, help the local communities and all that stuff. But it's going to take time. There's no doubt about it. And this is different. This is not your grandmother's recession. I mean, when you have GDP drop 30%, whatever it was, 34%, I mean, that's not normal. We're doing a lot more bankruptcies and this is going to have more of a duration \u2013 durational impact than what we've experienced probably since the early 1990s. Now, the reality is in the early1990s, for those that survived, we're able to prosper after that period of time lapsed. But when you \u2013 in order to really answer that question, it's \u2013 you've got to have a medical \u2013 you've got to tie it to a medical and I am nowhere in a position to respond to that. I mean, you got to have a country moving more or less together and obviously, that's not happening. So I wish I could pinpoint it, but we're not \u2013 we're anticipating more of a durational impact here and our planning has been very conservative. And that's why we cut our CapEx, that's why we cut our overhead, that's why we're working with our local entrepreneurs in abating rent because, frankly, if we force the issue, they wouldn't open the doors again and that's why we're trying to be \u2013 if our retailers are willing to work with us, we're willing to work with them. If they're not and we continue to try to work with them and they're still not working with us then that's when we have to look at \u2013 unfortunately look at other options. So I wish I could pinpoint it. It's a fair question. I think we'll have a better \u2013 I think as every month and quarter goes on, I'll have a better impact certainly would be our view by the end of this year to like lay out what we see in 2021. I think we're getting closer to that. I have in my own mind what it will be but I'm not willing to share it with you not because I don't like you. I do. I'm just not willing to share it. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's all fair. I would hope for more but I completely understand that, David. I do want to have one follow-up question if I may. And you alluded to this. Look, I think there's a lot of media headlines that retail real estate is dying and malls are dying, I pushed back on that for a variety of reasons. I think we have too much retail real estate in the United States. So, on the other side of this once retail real estate rationalizes, I would agree with you that we're going to be stronger. So, I guess I would ask you, how much do you think has to rationalize given what you know about COVID-19? Is it 10%, 20%, 40%? I think in the past, you've talked about a 20% to 30% number like go back many years. How do you think about that because I could see the industry post rationalization being a lot stronger footing than it is this today? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, there's no question there's going to be material rationalization across the whole spectrum. And that's all the product categories within our retail sector. So, it will be malls, strip centers, certain outlets, power centers, lifestyle centers. Look, it's hard to \u2013 again, it's hard to put a handle on it. I think the bigger thing will not be so much whether it's 20% or 30%, but just it's going to happen like now. It's not \u2013 a lot of the time when you had a product that was limping along, it could limp for a while. That half-life has shortened over the last five, six, seven years. Now, it's like immediately shortened. So, you're going to see rationalization, without question, and it's going to happen quicker. But again, I'd be reluctant to give you a real number to hang your hat on. But your number that you mentioned certainly sounds within the realm of possibilities. Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you, David. That's it for me. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. No worries. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hello out there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: How are you? Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hey, David. So, I'm going to ask the question that Alex left off of his laundry list of questions earlier about Amazon. So, I'm curious, and I know a lot of investors are as well, on your thoughts on the idea of Amazon potentially taking up space at malls and former anchor boxes. Do you think it would work from a practical sense? Would it add any value to or benefit to the centers' shoppers or the retailers, and could it even potentially \u2013 does it even work from an economic perspective? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I'm really not in any position to respond to market rumors or speculation. So, that's really with respect to that. I mean, generally, I'd say, the important thing going on that we're seeing is that more and more retailers are distributing their e-commerce orders from their stores. And so, they're fulfilling from their stores and they're also \u2013 the curbside pickup or all sorts of fulfillment options are available. That's a good trend long-term for us. But beyond that, I don't want to get into logistics or any kind of speculation really around JCPenney and/or Amazon, and we should leave it at there. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Fair enough. Thank you for that. My second question is really a question on the spreads turning flat here in the quarter implying there's a meaningful decline in second quarter. Curious how we should think about the leases signed during the quarter. Any big deals of note there having a disproportional impact? Were these leases generally signed pre- or post-COVID? And how should we think about the near-term trajectory of spread near-term, if it's roughly what we saw in 2Q? Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's a good question. Obviously, Q2, we did not do a lot of new business. Okay. So, we were in mostly triage levels. I mean, I hope everybody appreciates what we had to deal from a \u2013 this pales in comparison. I'm not putting our slice of the world anywhere near the health and welfare of people and the hospitals and all that, but we were dealing with a very difficult environment. We had to close pretty quickly. We reopened. We had all sorts of different rules across all sorts of different counties. We tried to manage that process the best of our abilities. We've got very little, if any, help on either real estate tax, sales tax, we had a lot of guidelines. We had then reinforced our buildings when we had the tragic consequences of the problems at the end of May, which cost us several million dollars, which kind of ended up in our numbers as well in fortifying our stuff. We had to work remotely, and then we had to help a lot of our local tenants in our \u2013 and lot of the local restauranteurs and so on. So, we've been drinking from the fire hose trying to. All of these things are unbelievable, every day is a judgment call. What do you do? Do you do this? Do you do that? You're not going to get perfect. You're not going to have \u2013 you're going to offend somebody, somewhere, sometime, and you just try to be level-headed and do it. So, with all that said, we went after trying to stabilize our tenant base the best that we could. We tried to reach out. We made a corporate decision to abate all local tenants as much \u2013 again, I'm sure there was a mistake somewhere, somehow. But we tried to do that immediately because we knew they were under a lot more pressure than we were. And the new business just wasn't there for Q2. What I'm told by our new business group is that people are starting to think about new business. Most of that's going to \u2013 if it does surface, most of them will be in 2021. I do think we'll see the benefit of a number of popups in our portfolio, both primarily in the outlet business from a number of great brands because they're sitting on excess merchandise. We think that's a great opportunity. Hopefully, they'll do great business and they will stay longer. And so, I think this spreads this year is going to be whacky enough to like, discount them. And because I don't think we're going to do as much new business, obviously renewals are going to be \u2013 we didn't finish all of our 2020 renewals, so that's going to be another judgment call about what the right level of rent is. That's going to be a retailer by retail decision. That's going to be whether they \u2013 US is a good partner or not. There will be a number of cases where we'll work out something acceptable to both parties. There will be some that we won't. We hope that will be in the minority. And frankly, we're \u2013 I'm not going to spend much time worrying about spreads this year. I just think we're just focused on getting our retailers open, getting traffic back, creating a safe environment for the communities to shop, feel comfortable again, and that kind of math, I'll worry about next year. Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Thank you for the thoughts. Good luck out there. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I was curious how much of the second quarter cost reductions should we see continue in the second half? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's hard to say. I mean, corporately, I must admit I have not had a mutiny yet, but at some point, it's around the corner. Okay. So, the executives here are still at reduced salaries and reduced comp. That's a tough one for me. I think about it a lot. So, I don't have an answer for that. So, there will be some of that obviously on the operating expenses, not as much because the standards of which \u2013 not that we \u2013 I mean, I hope everyone appreciates that we've always run our properties \u2013 again, we're not perfect. I'm sure there's mistakes, potholes here and there. But we have a new standard that we have to produce that's going to be more expensive. So, from a property level, we probably won't see a lot of benefit in forward \u2013 it would be great if we got some help. If you look at our P&L, the one area we did not get any help and it's retail real estate tax. So, I would hope that these local municipalities would look favorably on what we deliver to the community, what the ad valorem taxes are for retail real estate compared to other forms of real estate, and give us a break. We deserve it. We're not treated fairly, and we need it. So, I don't think we'll get it, but that's where we should get it. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up, what percentage of ABR is tied to entertainment, dining, and fitness? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's a good question. I don't know. Anybody know off the top of my head? No. I don't know \u2013 you mean in general, just in... Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, in general. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm going to say probably 5%, but Tom will give you the exact number. Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The dog needs to be walked or fed. Ki Bin Kim - Truist Securities : So, I wanted to go back to the kind of high-level rent collection data that you provided. So, it looks like you collected about 57% of rents in 2Q. Without going category by category, just high level, what percent of the rent that did you not collect, did you actually write off or reserve for? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, again, I don't want to get too much, but it's in the \u2013 I mean, we're probably in the 15% to 20% range, somewhere in that range, okay? Ki Bin Kim - Truist Securities : Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Again, I don't want to get too much on this because all of this will eventually come out, and you have to make \u2013 as you know, we have the new rules and all of this will be out with the wash by year end, but that's kind of where we think. We took a pretty big hit this quarter as you know, I mean, we had roughly $215 million between abatements and write-offs. So, on the portfolio-wide kind of gives you the number for the quarter. Ki Bin Kim - Truist Securities : And do you have any data on like what percent of your tenants do you deem as local tenants? And if you're thinking about actually providing loans for these tenants besides those abatements or deferrals? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We don't really give out the local number and we don't provide any real loans. If they are, its maybe \u2013 historically, we might get notes with a local tenant if they've had a problem with their business. But it's not something that we do upfront and maybe a note because rent has been paid over time, but we don't loan \u2013 we rarely loan tenants' money to the point of kind of a non-event for us. Ki Bin Kim - Truist Securities : And would that be the same for restaurants too? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Correct. Ki Bin Kim - Truist Securities : I'm assuming that if restaurants go dark it might be hard to bring it (00:55:11) back. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, we'll do tenant allowance for retailers and restaurants, but we won't loan money. And again, we're pretty good on credit, making sure that if we are providing some form of the build-out, one that the retailers providing the bulk of that and that they have credit stand behind it. Ki Bin Kim - Truist Securities : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is open. Linda Tsai - Jefferies LLC : Hi. In terms of buying out the bankrupt retailers, you talked through some hypothetical numbers, buying at or below cost generating gross margins of 35% to 40%. I would think there's a lot of opportunities that exist. How do you go about picking and choosing? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Great question. And it's not like we want a huge portfolio of this. But listen, ABG, Authentic Brands Group, is a fantastic intellectual property group, does business throughout the world and has a ton of brands. So, normally \u2013 and they provide a lot of value on sourcing, marketing, international operations, et cetera. So, normally, when we're doing that, we work with them. They're very, very good about understanding where there is value in the brand because they know how they can monetize that intellectual property. Obviously, we have a point of view because we know what the consumer likes. So, you put the two of us together in a room and that's how we do it. So, we rarely play. I mean, there have been unfortunately a lot of bankruptcies this year. It's not like we're playing in a lot of them. And the other thing I'd point out, Linda, is that we get rumors we're playing, and we are not playing and again because we don't want to talk about market rumors and speculation. We don't deny rumors as well, but we're very selective in what we look at. And again, the brands got to have value. We got to believe we can \u2013 without trying to hit an inside straight, we better believe we can make it EBITDA positive pretty easily. We're not into miracle worker here. We want to be able to do it like what we've done in the past. Linda Tsai - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for that. And then could you discuss how COVID impacts varied across your different property types. Maybe say the Mills, Premium Outlets, enclosed malls as it relates to rent collections and then traffic upon reopening. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I would say generally and again it depends on location. But I think it's undeniable at this point that it's a little bit location oriented. And a lot of that is kind of where we see stability maybe in that market and lack of a rise in COVID cases. In addition to that, I mean I do think the consumer generally feels a little more comfortable in the outdoor environment. But I would also really underline that a lot of it is just tied to where these cases ebb and flow. And that right now is a big determinant. Linda Tsai - Jefferies LLC : Did rent collections vary at all across property types? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: They have \u2013 but since we deal with these retailers basically across the board, it's not like they can pay us in this center or not pay us in that center because one's enclosed and one is open. And when we're talking to them, we're talking to them across the portfolio. So, you may see different trends if you only have this kind of product versus that kind of product. But since we're dealing with these retailers across our portfolio, for us, it hasn't \u2013 there's no differential. For others, it might be a different case. Linda Tsai - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Just one last one. In terms of the $215 million in abatements and write-offs, how would you expect that number to trend in 3Q and 4Q? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: My guess, it'll \u2013 again, it's a little bit unpredictable. But there'll be some \u2013 I'm sure we'll deal with some more in August, September. We do have, as I mentioned, properties closed again. I hope, for all sorts of reasons, primarily because COVID is not rising, that would be great for all of us. But we still \u2013 there's still a risk that we might \u2013 because we're in this weird dilemma that we're not considered essential, we run the risk. So, it's hard to predict. I can't make a prediction on that. I was feeling pretty good in June about finally getting back to work, and I feel less good in July, and now I'm totally confused. But I am sure we are still going to deal with issues going forward. And so, there'll be \u2013 I'm sure there'll be some level abatements and some collection issues as we move forward for the rest of the year. Linda Tsai - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: Thank you. I'm just trying to reconcile a couple of numbers here. I know you gave the collection data, which is inclusive of deferrals for April, May, June. They ran between 50% of contractual rent to 70%. And in those months yet, if we look at your cash flow statement in the 10-Q, it's showing that your quarterly cash flow from operations were down over 90% if you just try and figure out what the quarter number is, not the six-month number. So, I mean that would presumably mean a pretty low cash collections number. I know you guys haven't given the cash collection number, but is there anything more you can explain on this issue as we're looking at these items? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I think frankly, Nick, you're maybe having a hard time with our income statement, we're happy to talk to you offline. But again, we had a lot of deals were done at the end of the quarter and processed in early July. So, we had a lot of collections in July all the way through July. The numbers are the numbers. So, if there's a particular number \u2013 we do have some retailers that haven't paid period and we're still under negotiation with a good chunk of our retailers to find out kind of where that stands. So, we haven't pressed the bruise (01:04:22) on everyone at this point. We certainly have the option to do so. We can't find a satisfactory deal. And so, I'm not sure what you're referring to, but we're happy to walk through it with you in more detail. Nicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: Yeah. No, I was specifically looking at the cash flow statement, not the income statement, which you're showing your cash flow down a lot from a cash from operations standpoint in the second quarter versus a year ago. And so, that's \u2013 I guess, what... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, we did have abatement. Okay. And we did have a reduction in our \u2013 I mean I don't know if you were here earlier, but I laid out how we went from property NOI to kind of where we were. We did lose roughly $460 million less our savings. So, I'm sure no one on this call wants me to repeat that, but it's available there for you on the transcript. Nicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: Okay. Yeah. I can follow up offline. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. There's no denying we have reduction in our cash flow from operations. We went through that earlier. Nicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: I guess what I'm trying to understand is what exactly we should be \u2013 what's the takeaway from the fact that you're saying that your collections are improving in July versus the second quarter? Is that a function of \u2013 just to be clear, does it mean your cash collections are improving? Or are you just now have more deferral agreement? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Nick, unfortunately, I've said a lot of this. So, I don't think you've \u2013 maybe you weren't on the early part. Yes, I said our cash collections \u2013 it was clear in the teleconference text that our cash collections in July improved to 73% with de minimis level of deferrals. I said that earlier. Okay? Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, David. Hi, everyone. Thank you. What was your process in determining the level of abatements granted? And to us, what is seemingly a kind shared pain approach, could you take us through the decision process in granting abatements? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Only if you have time for me to talk about 9,000 lease amendments, okay? So, Derek, a lot goes into that. I mentioned earlier, it's a lot of judgment calls. It's all about the relationship. We went out of our way universally. Again, now, I'm sure there'll be some local retailer or restaurateur where something got lost in translation with our field. But we went out of our way universally to abate all local entrepreneurs and businesses, and I'm sure there'll be somebody that said, hey, I didn't get it, but that was the message from top. And then, there were other retailers and it was all a function of understanding their credit, understanding whether there were some potential trades. Every situation was different. Again, that's why we don't like to get into the granularity of every deal because I certainly don't want one retailer say, I didn't get that, why did you do that versus this. But it's years \u2013 it's been in business almost 60 years. And me personally, have been doing this for 30 years that ends up saying grace over what's the right way to proceed is with a retailer. And again, let me reinforce, I'm sure we made mistakes, I'm sure we didn't handle everything right, but we did the best that we could with the set of circumstances that we were dealing with. Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks. And what does the return to development plan at Phipps Plaza? Could you guys quantify the likely timeline or what you need to see happen in order to resume instruction, and really how far is completion kind of pushed off at this point? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question. So, on Phipps, we are getting very close to resuming and finishing the hotel. We have the building called the anchor building, which we're currently evaluating what our options there are. And then we also have a office building that was part of that that we could sit on that for a while. We're seeing \u2013 the good news about that is we're really never going to start that till next year anyway. So we're going to \u2013 we have the chance to kind of give it a few months to see. But I'm expecting the hotel to resume construction here in the near future and ultimately the anchor building probably within the next two to three months. And then the office building will be market-dependent, and we'll probably not know that until early next year, the timing, that is. Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon. David you provided the monthly trajectory of both rent collections and deferrals which have been improving sequentially. I was wondering if you could provide the same details about how rent abatements have been trending over the past few months? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I would say way down and the fact is since we're not closed, the rent abatement was around the period of time we were closed. So now that essentially other than the California situation we're not closed. There might be an abatement here or there, but it's generally I would hope well past this. John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. So this is not a case where the collections were favorably reported because of the abatements going up as well? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Now, I said that in my text and I think that's very important to reinforce. So, our collections that I quoted you were based on our rent roll that we sent out \u2013 that we built. So we took abatements that percent would be dramatically increased, okay? We gave you the rent roll period end of story pre-abatement. So if you took the abatement our collections would \u2013 as a percent would be much higher but we chose not to do it on that basis. John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Thanks for the clarity. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors : Hi, good afternoon. Could you share how... David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Hi. How are you doing? Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors : Good. Could you share how shopper traffic and tenant sales at your domestic centers was in July compared to the prior year? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We don't get July until basically August 20. So we don't get that near until the end of the month. Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors : Is there any color you could provide on maybe just near-term since reopening? Like is tenant \u2013 is foot traffic down 50%? Is it down 20%? Any ballpark figure you could provide us where the traffic is domestically? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's all over the board. And again, I said earlier, Vince, that when we first opened it actually we were \u2013 traffic was down but conversion was high. And as cases rise, frankly the consumers being cautious and traffic is down. I mean overall traffic is down, but it's so location driven and geographic driven that I hate to give you a national average. It really is a function of when we open and whether or not COVID resurfaced in those markets. Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors : Fair enough. And then just is there more color you can provide on the geographic differences like which regions are performing much closer to normal and where is it still a lot slower? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think when we first opened \u2013 look, I think the hardest hit areas continue are in the tourism areas. That is \u2013 and as you know that's important to our industry in totality. That's been and continues to be the worst performing. Frankly, the locations in early when we got opened, the consumer was excited to get out of their house. We saw basically the Sunbelt, Southwest, West was not too bad outside of the tourist areas. COVID obviously increased in those areas and that had a slowdown for sure. Northeast was late to open. I mean, frankly, we just opened the Northeast basically the end of June and, in some cases, New York in July. So it's \u2013 we really don't have a lot to tell you on that. But traffic's been slowly building ex the tourist areas. Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors : I appreciate that color. One more quick one for me. What percentage of your contractual rent is current [technical difficulty] (01:15:48) second quarter occupancy? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm sorry. You broke up there. Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors : Oh, I'm sorry. I asked what percentage of your contractual rent is currently in bankruptcy, included in second quarter occupancy? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Around 4%-ish that's in bankruptcy that flew through the second quarter. Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors : Okay. Thank you. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, clearly, the retail industry is facing some headwinds right now, and you've seen the non-essential retail center being mandated shut. As you look forward, does this change your thinking on how your malls are going to look? And also how your outlets are going to look? And in particular, obviously in Europe and in Asia, what you see in a lot of the malls more than in the US is grocer anchors. Do you envision more grocers at Simon malls in three years' time? And maybe also comment on your view particularly regarding the outlets and maybe reducing the prevalence of apparel and maybe adding other things to your outlet properties. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, I'm a big believer in the outlets, and if Europe is any indication, the outlets across Europe and in Asia are basically almost back to where they were. And so I think the big issue on generally the outlets is just, we don't have COVID yet stabilized. Obviously, we've got some retailer bankruptcies and whatnot that we're going to have to deal with that they affect all of retail real estate and affect the outlets as well. But I don't think there's anything dramatically broken with the outlet business. I think it's just a function of getting people back to where they feel comfortable of getting out of their houses and shopping, and they really like the outlet product. So I'm not overly worried about it. Obviously, outlets that are in tourism areas are going to be harder hit or just whether it's domestic or international tourism just because lack of general mobility. I'm hopeful that, yes, that may take some time but eventually we will get past that. The duration of that could be some time, could be a year or two but we'll be past that. Listen \u2013 and then the -there will be a continual change with the mall product. I mean we do think that's going to present some opportunities. We probably have too many department stores per big mall. But generally, the real estate is really good and we're going to densify it. I think the idea that what we had was working on over time will be \u2013 will continue. I mean, we may have to get through this rough patch that the industry is going through. But this is good real estate that can be redeveloped. Our basis is very, very low. Our basis in the department stores whether through leases or \u2013 is very low. So I think there will be a number of opportunities for us to redevelop that real estate. So I do think earlier question was do we have too many malls? Sure. But they'll be \u2013 the malls that ultimately survive will benefit from that contraction. And, look, who knows? I mean, there's all sorts of ideas floating around about what the mall can do and how it can service the community. And we continue to work on a lot of those things. So I think great real estate will always weigh out, and I just think we've got to continue to evolve the product, which we were making very good progress on and will continue to do so. Floris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : And would that potentially include enhanced or increased grocery exposure in malls, in your view? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm hopeful. I hope so. I mean, their real estate requirements are \u2013 obviously, you have a lot of constraints to them. So \u2013 but, yes, I am hopeful that we can certainly do more business with that category. Floris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : Great. And if I can have a follow-up question maybe regarding your investment in retailers, and clearly it's \u2013 some people seem to be somewhat concerned about going outside the \u2013 or off the fairway, if you will, in some of your investments, whether it's Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, or Forever 21, and obviously the big one potentially, JCPenney. Presumably, the return expectation for you to do something outside of your core business has got to be higher. What gets you \u2013 what deals get you most excited, and where do you think you're going to make the highest returns, if you can share some of that with us? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, again, on \u2013 we're not going to comment on market rumors, public rumors, et cetera. We did mention Brooks and Lucky because those are out there in the public through the bankruptcy process. I'd say the very simple thing is, I want to see in retail \u2013 there is more volatility in retail for sure. So the pay back is got to be immediate. We're hopeful to buy these things at least on the equity, I mean in some cases 1 to 2 times EBITDA, get our investment back immediately. And it's got to be really cheap. And we're not buying these retailers, both Aero and Forever 21. And if we were awarded the stalking horse in Brooks Brothers but we'll see if we win. We'll see what happens. Lucky is in the same spot. We're buying these in bankruptcy. So I think that we're not buying these at retail. Retailer today would trade at, who knows, but trade at 5, maybe 5 or 6 times EBITDA, I don't know. I mean it's all over the place. But we're buying these things that basically if we have to put equity in, if we have to, we're going to get our investment back in year one. So then everything else is on \u2013 and then if you have a great brand, listen, we could end up taking Sparc and selling it through a spec (01:24:30) for $4 billion and then you'll say, hey, what a good idea, just give us time to prove our thesis right. Or at the end of the day, if we screw up, we will have the loss, a de minimis amount of money given our market cap. Floris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : Thanks, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. No worries. Operator : Next question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks and good evening, David. And hopefully, someone has brought you a glass of water after 90 minutes. So I appreciate you sticking around. The first question was around corporate structure. A number of years ago, and we sort of had this conversation off and on over many years, about REIT versus de-REIT. And I don't know if you saw, one of the present REITs decided to de-REIT. But just given the evolution of your business and where the puck is going, becoming a little bit more vertically integrated, how do you think about being a REIT versus not being a REIT and obviously the dividend that comes with that? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, no real change. I mean, we study that at least once a year. What's the likely prospect of corporate income taxes going up is probably pretty high. So obviously, we are committed to paying a very meaningful dividend. Our yield is scrumptious. So we study it. No real intention. There are certain limitations because of the REIT structure in \u2013 all new retailers even though we own through joint ventures that we're working with the legislators that's hopefully they'll see the benefit of it. I mean, we are literally saving jobs. We save a gazillion \u2013 not a gazillion, I mean that's silly, but we save a ton of jobs at Forever 21, a ton of jobs at Aero. We're going to save a bunch of jobs at Lucky and Brooks. And the reality is the legislators, there are these restrictions on bad income which we are big enough that doesn't really restrict us, at some point it could give us a headache. We're hopeful that the government is focused on jobs. We know that regardless of the side of the aisle you're on and we're hopeful that common sense will prevail. This rule is from the 1960 REIT legislation. It's irrelevant today. It's good for the economy if we're in a position with our partners to save jobs. I'm hopeful common sense will prevail. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: But you don't feel that given the liquidity and just you've managed your balance sheet exceptionally well going into this, and you have a ton of liquidity. But having that dividend obligation and not having complete clarity of how deep you can go in the vertical integration, it doesn't sound like that's altered your thinking of REIT versus not REIT. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Not at this time. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's a very good question. We think about it, like I said, once a year. But I do think, Michael \u2013 I mean, look, who knows? But the corporate tax rates could go back up and obviously makes that equation. Even in today's world, we're still profitable. We still have \u2013 even with all the abatements and all of the problems we're dealing with, we're going to have taxable income. So, I mean we'd be a tax-paying entity. And, we are hopeful that even though we're completely out of favor as an investment fit and it is what it is that obviously there is some attraction to our dividend-paying abilities. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And you talked about jobs and saving jobs in terms of the investments you're making in the retailers. Why hasn't there been widespread government support at the federal level, at the state level, at the local level for the retail industry as a whole? Where is it breaking down? Is it the animosity between the landlords and the tenants who just can't get together? Is it the leadership of the government in relations that at the retail industry? I was like, why \u2013 like what's going on? Like why hasn't it been done for an industry that's so critical to so many jobs in this country? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, just to be clear, we are not looking for federal government help. Our biggest frustration is how we get taxed, real estate tax, ad valorem tax. Our biggest frustration historically, as you know, was the moratorium, on the Internet sales taxation. Thankfully, the Supreme Court overruled the Quale (01:30:40) decision. I forget \u2013 it's been so long though, I forgot the name. But thankfully, we could never get legislators to treat commerce fairly, whether it's brick-and-mortar Internet without \u2013 as you know, unless \u2013 wherever they had (01:31:02). So now that, that is more or less \u2013 and they left it to the states which I'm fine with. Pretty much everything is taxed on an equal playing field. But my biggest frustration is we are the golden goose when it comes to real estate tax payments compared to other real estate properties. Whether you look at how we're assessed per value versus warehouse, industrial. That needs to be addressed, but that's a local game. I mean, there's nothing nationally that's going to be done. Obviously, there's been a lot of jurisdictions in the COVID scenario that has treated enclosed malls a lot differently than enclosed retail even when they open. Forget essential \u2013 by the way, I get essential. I had no problem with essential, and both the federal and the state governments had to do what they had to do. But when they opened back up, a number of states dealt with the enclosed mall a lot differently than other retailers, and we were cleaner, had better protocols. We had better air and all those other stuff. But that was a high level of frustration, continues to be the case as we see what's going on in California. So trying to restructure the CMBS and that, we're not expecting that. Let the documents be the documents. I've got no problem with that. But it would be nice that we just got a little bit of the benefit on the real estate tax. And treating retailer \u2013 there's not a lot of difference, frankly, between a Costco store and a Simon mall when it comes to protocols and cleanliness and air quality, and by and large, man, let us compete. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We suffered two months, 10,500 days where we could not compete, and that's what \u2013 that's just not fair. So I don't want anything other than the ability to compete. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Last question, if I may, just your reference to the early 1990s made me think to \u2013 we took a lot of those companies public, right? It was Chapter 11 or S-11 for the REIT industry. And you think about where other retail landlords are today relative to your position where they don't have the balance sheet, they don't have the capital, they don't have as much institutional knowledge, they don't have the operating history and know-how that you have. I guess, they're reacting, does that competitive pressure on you because they're just trying to survive where so many others within this vertical are so much more balance sheet challenged and have weaker assets that they may be doing uneconomical transactions. Does that roll over to you or impede any of your negotiations with tenants? David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I don't worry about that one iota. We do \u2013 I'm sure we're going to make mistakes but we have to look at it from our standpoint and a lot less what others are doing. I don't think about it at all. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time, David. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Michael. David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. I'm sorry. We are warbled on there but thanks for your calls and be safe, everyone. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call.

For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good evening and thank you for joining us today. Our results this quarter reflect continued progress in tenant reopenings and rent collections. All of our U.S. retail properties are currently open with nearly 25,000 tenants across our portfolio open and operating, and welcoming shoppers to this year\u2019s extended holiday shopping season. Collections from our U.S. retail portfolio have continued to improve. As of November 6, we have collected 85% of third quarter net build rents. Second quarter collections are now 72% and including the deferred amounts in the calculation, the second quarter collection rate increases to 78%. The details of our collection percentages are clearly laid out in our press release issued this evening. While we\u2019ve made significant progress in addressing collections, we still have some unresolved amounts with certain larger national tenants, who unfortunately are refusing to pay their contractual rent even though they are open and operating. Let me turn to our results. Third quarter reported FFO was $723 million or $2.05 per share. I am pleased with the solid profitability of the quarter and $600 million in cash flow we generated for the third quarter. Our domestic and international operations in the quarter, however, were negatively impacted by approximately $1.10 per diluted share primarily due to reduced lease income, including sales base rents or ancillary property revenues caused by the COVID-19 disruption partially offset by $0.23 per share from cost reduction initiatives or a net $0.87 per diluted share and then another $0.05 from our international operations as well. And the third quarter also includes our FFO $0.10 per share of lower straight line rent and $0.06 and the litigation expenses and $0.01 lower lease settlement income compared to Q3 of 2019. Now, like I did last quarter for Q2, let me walk through the components of the year-over-year change in the context of portfolio NOI presentation, which you can find on Page 17 supplement issued today and as a reminder, the following amounts are on a gross basis and are not at company share. Total portfolio NOI decreased from $1.5 billion in the third quarter of last year to $1.2 billion this year, a decrease of 22% or approximately $338 million. The year-over-year decline for the third quarter was primarily due to the following approximately $270 million in total from both domestic rent abatements and higher provisions for credit losses, primarily associated with retail bankruptcies. It is important to note we did not amortize any of the abatements granted. We recorded the abatement as negative lease income in the period, in which the abatement terms were agreed with the tenant. The majority of the abatements that were granted were to the thousands of local, small business \u2013 small businesses, entrepreneurs, and restauranteurs, who have been suffering immensely with COVID. Our efforts to support local tenants in our centers were resoundingly appreciated as nearly 95% of our local tenants reopened their stores and additional $165 million of the reduction was due to lower minimum rents and reimbursements. Sales-based and short-term leasing due to the \u2013 and ancillary property revenues as a reduction from COVID, as well as lease terminations from our bankrupt retailers, and as I mentioned to you before lower sales volume, due to a lingering COVID impact. These decreases were partially offset by $100 million of our cost reduction initiatives. Now, operating metrics, Mall and Premium outlet occupancy at third quarter was 91.4% down 150 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. All of that is essentially a function of tenant bankruptcies, which caused 120 basis-point reduction. Our average base rent was $56.13, up 2.9% year-over-year and we are pleased to report shopper traffic and total sales volume continue to improve with each sequential month and throughout the third quarter, quarter-over-quarter sales that\u2019s Q3 of 2019 compared to Q3 of 2020 were down 10% leasing spreads decline for the trailing 12 months, primarily due to the mix of deals from the prior year period that had fallen out of the rent spread calculation. The leasing environment is improving. In the third quarter, we signed 600 leases for nearly two million square feet, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. We are pleased to see a continued long interest, for spaces across our differentiated portfolio. Demand for space in our premium outlet portfolio has been really strong with the space that has become available as a result of recent tenant bankruptcies. We are signing deals with the best new and exciting brands who want access to our highly productive outlets and an ode to Rick who\u2019s not here, but listening uncertain, we are executing both long-term and pop-up deals with leading brands, including names like Prada, Ferrari, Allbirds and UGG, just to name a few and many, many more. During the quarter, we also resumed construction on the redevelopment of the Macy\u2019s Men\u2019s Store at Stanford Shopping Center with a RH mansion and we started construction of a former Bloomingdale store for the falls and at The Shops at Mission Viejo. Our net \u2013 the good news with this diligent focus on capital spend, all approved projects right now through 2020, our net cash funding is $140 million. Now, let me turn to brand and retail investments Spark, as you know, is our 50/50 joint venture with Authentic Brands Group, acquired Brooks and Lucky Brand\u2019s out of bankruptcies. Both are storied and widely recognized brands with combined global sales of over $1.5 billion. We acquire companies cheaply and we believe we can grow the EBITDA and achieve a significant return on our investment. Both brands have been integrated into the Spark platform, and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in such a short period of time. We recently partnered with Brookfield as you know and are in contract to acquire the operations, intellectual property and certain real estate of the J.C. Penney Company in a going concern transaction under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code. We believe in the Penney\u2019s brand, the company did over $9 billion in sales pre-COVID. We believe, we can return the company to increasing sales and grow the EBITDA. The company has a loyal core diverse and inclusive cost base concentrated in a moderate to higher aspirational category. This customer is important to the community as is J.C. Penney and to us, and we expect we will continue to grow this customer over time, and we\u2019re extremely proud to serve the community in that capacity. We believe that with us in Brookfield, bringing focus the passion, ownership, enhanced financial discipline to the operations, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to earn a significant return on our investment. And as part of that, we also anticipate our good partner; Authentic Brands Group will become an investor in the buying group. And as importantly, we\u2019re very pleased to say for 60,000 jobs in our country, we continue to do our part to support the local community in our efforts. now, balance sheet; at the end of the third quarter, our total liquidity was more than $9.7 billion consisting of $8.2 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity $1.5 billion, for a total of $9.7 billion. And this is, as a reminder, net of $623 million of quarter-end commercial paper outstanding. We\u2019ve been active in the secure debt markets and have addressed all of our remaining loan maturities for the year, including a refinancing of the mills at Jersey Gardens through a single asset CMBS securitization, which has been priced and scheduled to fund next week. Our debt covenants have \u2013 are well above required levels, well above it with significant headroom and our balance sheet, financial flexibility, our distinct advantages in our retail real estate industry that cannot and I\u2019m sure are not overlooked and the dividends we paid a common stock dividend of $1.30 in cash. And then finally, before we open it up to any questions, I again want to thank my Simon colleagues for their continued result in running our business under often trying circumstances, the environment that has been constantly changing. We withstood COVID. We have withstood government shutdowns. We have withstood lack of federal and state health, especially in real estate taxes. We have withstood fires in Northern California, hurricanes in Louisiana and elsewhere, and civil unrest and we\u2019re pleased with the cash flow we\u2019re generating and I want to thank my colleagues for busting their hump and things are looking up. We\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from bank of America. Your question, please. Craig Schmidt : Great, thank you. I guess, given the acceleration of COVID cases and the possibility of future mandated closings, I wonder if you\u2019re seeing greater consistency concerning store opening orders or store closing orders from state and local governments, particularly with the regards to the demands made on standalone retailers versus mall operated properties? David Simon : Well, the only situation that we have right now is in El Paso, where an enclosed mall is been asked to essentially shut down, that is of recent, that happened over the weekend. Again, I think enclosed malls are being treated unfairly and inconsistently, but we deal with what we deal with right now. That\u2019s the only one Craig, we\u2019re hopeful that that will reopen. And listen, I think the consumer obviously is cautious. Our quarter-over-quarter sales decrease is only 10%. So, the consumer is starting to come back. They\u2019re wearing masks and with all our protocols, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re hopeful that \u2013 that trend will continue, but there\u2019s certainly no guarantees. And as far as predicting the government and state and local actions, I mean obviously, the level of inconsistency, it\u2019s been very frustrating. It\u2019s been state-by-state, city-by-city, county-by-county. It is a testament and often on look \u2013 often overlook that enable to deal with this as well as we have, and we\u2019ve done it, when I\u2019ve asked people to take pay cuts, and they\u2019ve done it. They\u2019ve shown up to work every day. You\u2019ve seen the collection \u2013 the improvement in collections. I think we\u2019re making basically all the right moves and \u2013 but we can only deal with what we can deal with. I have no \u2013 I don\u2019t know if further restrictions will be in order, we have yet to see any evidence that our environment spreads anything. obviously, the outlets and outdoor centers are doing better. But as you know, we have 50% of our portfolio NOI dedicated to that. That\u2019s kind of why I think you see our performance the way it is, and the one line item that\u2019s up, if you looked at our financials, is real estate taxes, when are local jurisdictions going to start giving relief to retail real estate taxes, compared to distribution warehouses and the like. It\u2019s completely opposite. We do more for the communities than other property types and I am hopeful that at one point in the near future that that they \u2013 these communities will recognize it. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then just as a follow-up, we\u2019ve noticed the store closing cadence has slowed since Labor Day. I\u2019m wondering if the occupancy number in 3Q 2020 could be the trough, or do you still expect maybe some lower occupancy in first quarter 2021? David Simon : Well, I think it\u2019ll \u2013 that\u2019ll be a function of whether we have further bankruptcies or not, Craig. I think based on what it is, we should be fine, but I mean, it is possible that we\u2019ll have further bankruptcies and we\u2019ll have to \u2013 when that happens, obviously, we\u2019ll deal with that. But there\u2019s certainly some bankruptcies that are potential out there in the next few months. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Rich Hill : Hey, good evening, David. Thanks for taking my question. first of all, thank you very much for the transparency on the bridge to rent collections. I think that\u2019s top-notch and best-in-class. So, thank you for doing it. I want to ask a strategy question and maybe, think about your portfolio. One of the things I think is misunderstood about Simon is that you\u2019re not \u2013 you own a diversified portfolio of retail real estate across property types in the quality spectrum. So, I\u2019m curious as you think about your portfolio on the other side of COVID-19, or do you like, are you comfortable with having, call it 46% to 49% of your total NOI coming from malls? Do you like \u2013 do you want less, do you want more outlets? Do you want more international? I\u2019m just really curious about how you think about your portfolio, maybe over the next decade. David Simon : Listen, I think the \u2013 we\u2019re a strong believer in the outlet business, as you know and especially, with retailers and brands moving more and more toward direct to consumer. And so I think that plays well into that and obviously, the outdoor environment continues to be an advantage certainly with the COVID [indiscernible] much part of our lives. So, I like where we are. I think, over time our portfolio, non-core assets will be shed, usually those don\u2019t have a material impact on our NOI or cash flow. And so I kind of like where we are \u2013 we\u2019ll probably shed some more properties. I think international is intriguing now. There\u2019s value that we\u2019ve added, the outlet business there that we have is very good. The outlet business in Asia is strong. So, we\u2019re going to want to grow that, but I feel kind of like the diversity by region, by product type and by \u2013 certainly, by domestic versus international. So, our international results were pretty good. They were down though; we had some new properties open up and some expansion. So, it\u2019s hard to see that, but the core number was down a little bit, but they came back pretty strong. Obviously, there\u2019s a big wave going on now in Europe. So, they\u2019re starting some more restrictions, but I think the direct to consumer from the brands is really important and I think that plays well in the outlet business. by the way, it\u2019s helping shop premium outlets. It\u2019s been an hour and a half with my partners, both at Rue La La, Gilt and the kinetic folks going through a [indiscernible] that want to be hooked up. So, this vision that we had is actually going to come to fruition, I hope, knock on wood. So, I like where we are. But we\u2019re always looking at quality real estate and I look at the quality more \u2013 quality is more important than potentially, the property type and I think that\u2019s the big focus and there\u2019s going to be obsolescent retail real estate. And so I think owning the best of the best is going to be a key to our success in the future. Rich Hill : Yes. That\u2019s really helpful, David. And the reason I was asking the question is just \u2013 it just seems to me that on this other COVID-19 world, whatever it is, that the retailer itself is probably, like you, agnostic, of the type and it\u2019s just looking for the best quality. So, I\u2019m curious is that beginning to resonate with retailers, as you think about \u2013 as they think about their footprint and how Simon Property Group can help fulfill those footprints, or is it still too early? David Simon : No, no, no, absolutely. And I would say that trend is happened completely. I mean we \u2013 in the mall \u2013 the mall is always competed with the guy across the streets for the retailers that competition still exists. It\u2019s certainly only going to be exacerbated by what\u2019s happened over the last six, seven, eight months and you\u2019ve got to own quality, and it\u2019s somewhat \u2013 today, it\u2019s somewhat irrelevant whether it\u2019s this kind of asset or that it\u2019s really, doesn\u2019t have critical mass. Is it well located? Does it serve the customer the way they want to be served? Rich Hill : Got it. Thanks, David. Look forward to chatting more. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. your question, please. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good evening. Good evening out there and handy. How\u2019s that David? David Simon : We\u2019re out \u2013 we\u2019re definitely out here, man. Okay. Alexander Goldfarb : Well look, your center of the biotech and health world. So, we appreciate everything that the biotechs are doing. David Simon : Because when Lilly gets their vaccine, I hope, my team is first in line, just because we\u2019re there across the street from us. Okay. So, we\u2019ll see. Alexander Goldfarb : Excellent, excellent. So, two questions; first again, appreciate the breakout and actually, this provides clarity, so that people can see the collections on a net basis, or if you want to do collections on a gross basis, it\u2019s helpful. You\u2019d mentioned the abatements were basically expensed in the period granted. So, on a go-forward basis, as we think about fourth quarter and the ramp up, does this mean that, we should see fourth quarter earnings jumped by $200 million, or how should we think about the impact of the deferrals and the impact of the abatements on a go-forward, so that we can think about the progression of Simon. I\u2019m not asking for guidance, but I\u2019m just trying to get a ramp of how much kind of\u2026 David Simon : You\u2019re asking for guidance cleverly. But I \u2013 listen, I would, everything is very still up in the air and obviously, we had \u2013 the worlds had this positive news today about the vaccine, but the fact is COVID is spiking. So, we have to be very serious that I would hope Alex. I mean, the big issue, the big thing that we\u2019ve confronted aggressively in Q2 and Q3, and the way I look at it, frankly, there\u2019s almost put those two quarters together, because you\u2019re right in a \u2013 we took the P&L hit when we granted the abatement and that\u2019s the right way to look at it, but I would think that the vast majority of any abatements are behind us. That\u2019s though to be clear, that\u2019s not to say that if there\u2019s an appropriate trade with a retailer that\u2019s a win-win for us, that we won\u2019t do more. And what does that really mean? it\u2019s new deals lease extent, it\u2019s the normal stuff to do. But I would literally hope that the worst is behind us. But listen, I don\u2019t know what the new COVID cases today was. I was a little busy, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s well over 100,000. And I can\u2019t guarantee that, but I would say between the credit provisions and the bankruptcies. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 the credit provisions, including the bankruptcies are kind of all melded in that number and the abatements that we went out of our way to do, we weren\u2019t legally required to do, but we did for people that were; one, on the local front, very sensitive to their plight; and two, there was a decent trade for us and the retailer, and we want them to prosper, frankly. I would hope that the vast majority of those two numbers, credit loss permissions, as well as abatements are behind us. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But David, as you said earlier, the abatements were largely your local tenants. So, they\u2019ve either made it or they haven\u2019t. So\u2026 David Simon : I said that majority of it, we did grant abatements to others. So, there\u2019s other abatements that have been in there. I mean \u2013 but that, again, that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty big number in terms of that we didn\u2019t have to do. And like I said, I hope that it\u2019s behind us. We\u2019ll have more in the Q4, but what we\u2019re projecting is a lot lower than what we\u2019ve had in Q2 and Q3 together. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So, correct, so basically, you\u2019ve taken the hard approach with both for all of the abatements in 2Q and 3Q. So hopefully, going forward is less. Okay. I got it. The second question, David is on the retailer front. Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, you did Aeropostale, Now you\u2019re going to do J.C. Penney. You highlighted the sales; you highlighted this customer base, that\u2019s loyal to the brand. What are \u2013 I mean, what are the elements without giving away totally the secret sauce? What are the elements that give you confidence when you look at trouble retailers and bankrupt ones, hey, what the core shopper for this brand is still there, despite that the retailers had trouble and is in bankruptcy, we feel that the core shopper is substantially still in place that we\u2019ve \u2013 that we can recover. Because it\u2019s certainly not just buying something cheap enough, anything can be cheap. there\u2019s got to be something tangible that makes you feel like you can get these customers to really come back and do it in a profitable way. So, what is it that gives you that confidence? David Simon : Well first of all, we\u2019re \u2013 we do, don\u2019t underestimating buying things cheap. Okay, Alex. So, that\u2019s always, it\u2019s always good to do that regardless. Listen, I just think based on the sales that we\u2019re seeing from the brands, we do a lot of brand research and then we attacked the problems with the profitability, given I won\u2019t name names, but Brooks brothers is a great example. It\u2019s got a great following. It had the strangest real estate footprint. They were \u2013 they had single stores that were paying $3 million a year in rent. I won\u2019t name names and the ability to reject those leases and create profitability there, get out of bad stores, reduce the overhead and then do all this special marketing and with ABG has been a winning formula. In addition to that, we source it better and since we have this platform, where we can leverage our base off of, it\u2019s just like \u2013 it\u2019s been a very profitable thing. I will tell you one day spark will be worth. I mean, this isn\u2019t my style, but it\u2019s going to be worth, we\u2019re going to make a plus on that investment without question. And it\u2019s just \u2013 we know the brands, we do a lot of research. ABG has been a very good partner. They know how to blow out the license aspect of it, which we\u2019re a partner in. We get out of bad stores. We buy the inventory at a discount. We right-size the overhead and we\u2019re just \u2013 and with better business judgment and lo and behold, you suddenly have a business that\u2019s got positive \u2013 significant positive EBITDA and you haven\u2019t paid much for it that and I think when you put it all together, we\u2019ll have something that\u2019ll have great positive EBITDA and we\u2019ll end up making $1 billion plus out of it. Alexander Goldfarb : Whether we look forward to you thinks\u2026 David Simon : Well, my partner thinks a lot more, but I\u2019ll give you that number. Alexander Goldfarb : We look forward to the exit and seeing that billion dollars crystallized. David Simon : I mean, yes. I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s been a good, it\u2019s been a great investment, so why \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll exit anytime soon. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Maybe, just following up on Alex\u2019s question more on the near to medium-term then. So, you\u2019ve mentioned that your investments in the retailers have been at inexpensive prices allowing you to earn a significant return in terms of how this ends up impacting Simon\u2019s own earnings in the near to medium-term. Do you expect the contribution to be meaningful itself? And if so, like by how much, and when, or is it that the investments generally support Simon\u2019s core business, or I guess both? David Simon : Well, I think it\u2019s the above. It will be profitable. We have that separate line item in our 8-K, what page is that? Caitlin Burrows : 17? David Simon : It\u2019s a little, the only thing, Caitlin, it is a little \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s more volatile than the rent aspect of our business. But you\u2019ll \u2013 because it\u2019s getting a little bit bigger, not materially bigger, but a little bigger, we decided to outline that separately. So, you can look at it as a standalone on its own. And then obviously, don\u2019t forget, they do pay us contracted rent to \u2013 Spark is a rent payer to the Simon Property Group and it\u2019s a property. So, we get the added benefit of the cash flow from running the business operate and then obviously, we get the added benefit of the rent, that\u2019s collected from the entity with the stores that we have. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then maybe, on the dividends, I know it\u2019s up to the board, but given the $1.30 per share dividend for 3Q, the historical dividend rate, current FFO and cash flow, what metrics or drivers will be most important in establishing the 4Q dividend and that of future quarters? David Simon : Well listen, I think, I think we still are very, very cautious in the sense of the dividend, just with respect to COVID. So, once we, I mean, I feel like at least that the worst is behind us, but we don\u2019t know for sure. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to be conservative in that. Obviously, you see our cap spend a way down a new development or redevelopment, that may pick up a little bit next year. So, we\u2019ll balance that obviously, we got to deal with our taxable income as well, but I can\u2019t give you a real through run rate yet and I think we\u2019ll be in a better position in 2021 to explain that when we do our earnings guidance, which we will reinstate in our earnings call, I mean, we have a pretty good idea what we expect from next year. But we\u2019d like to go ahead and finish the year as well, given all the volatility out there, but we\u2019re confident of dividend and the cash paying aspects of it and the cash flow generation from our company. And I think if you saw that in the Q3, a reasonably healthy pickup from Q2 and when we were really in the midst of trying to figure out COVID. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. your question, please. Michael Bilerman : Great, thank you. Good evening, David. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the leasing pipeline. You\u2019ve talked about the leasing that you accomplished in the third quarter, that two million square feet and a very large pipeline that you\u2019re working on. And I was wondering if you can provide us maybe with some a little bit more granularity about that pipeline, how much of it is new leasing for vacant space, new leasing for tenants that are going to be vacating [ph] and also potential renewal activity. And within that, maybe you can sort of just highlight the changing nature of maybe, the leases. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s differences in term or TIs or anything, just to give us a little bit more flavor for what the current environment is like. David Simon : Well again, that\u2019s, I\u2019m not going to get into the \u2013 as much as you want. I\u2019m not going to \u2013 that\u2019s not really the purpose of the call to go through the granularity of all the leases. But I would say generally, the lease terms have not changed. TAs have not really increased and we\u2019re seeing more box activity. There\u2019s a number of retailers that want to grow their footprint in the outlet business, a number of the better and the higher brands. We\u2019re also seeing that the Parkers of the world wanting to grow their footprint and the internet oriented companies then you see companies like American Eagle and others that are growing their footprint. There\u2019s a well-known retailer that has their kind of casual wear business that\u2019s growing their footprint significantly. I think we\u2019ve got 20 deals in the works for them. So, it\u2019s across the board and I would say, we\u2019re mostly replacing spaces that we got back from bankruptcies, leases that have terminated and the renewals are \u2013 a lot of the renewals we\u2019re doing now, we\u2019re doing as part of our COVID initiation. So to the extent that we did a deal in abatement, we may have addressed 2020 and 2021 renewals, and it\u2019s a judgement retailer by retailer and it\u2019s working it, I mean, obviously the nations aren\u2019t easy, because I mean, COVID has made them nervous and obviously, there\u2019s a lot of excess capacity in our retail real estate industry. But I think we\u2019ll hold our own and I \u2013 and look, I think the cash flow, we\u2019ll see improvements for cash flow next year. And again, \u2013 and that will be a combination of lease renewals, new business, better sales, we lost a lot of income just, because we were shut down with all of our Simon brand venture income, all the stuff that\u2019s traffic-driven. So, I think we\u2019ll make a rebound along all those lines. And no, we\u2019re not doing just percentage rent deals. The outlet business has had historically; some of the lead anchors have had percent rent deals only. to the extent that we do it, we have a floor in there and a clearly defined definition of sales, but it\u2019s all over the board, but it\u2019s \u2013 I guess, what we\u2019re trying to convey to you, Michael, is that we are open and doing your business, and that\u2019s support, and I think we\u2019ll have a better, we\u2019ll get more granular next quarter, but we\u2019re open to doing new business and the retailers are \u2013 sure there are a number of closing stores. There are a number of bankruptcies, but the ones that are out there are looking to grow their footprint. Michael Bilerman : That\u2019s helpful color. And then just as a follow-up on capital deployment obviously, the big focus of yours has been a lot of these innovative transactions buying some brand named retailers, but you also talked on the call in response to a previous question about buying high-quality real estate and I wanted to better understand what sort of opportunities may be out there, either buying from your joint venture partners, which may want to reduce their retail, or maybe, they don\u2019t and they want to go further in, but you also have a transaction that you\u2019re having over, that\u2019s very high-quality real estate. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand how all of this fits together. David Simon : Well, Michael, again, I respect you immensely and we really \u2013 I\u2019m not going to not going to get into the tailwind situation; obviously, you saw our litigation expense with it. But we\u2019re not out of \u2013 I\u2019d say if there is quality real estate, we\u2019re going to look at it and much like \u2013 and it, but there\u2019s got to be bargains that can be had. And so we\u2019ll see what that transpires, but nothing really, I want to \u2013 and also want to be, because we\u2019ve been asked this. I mean, we\u2019re not between the penney and closing of Brooks and lucky. There\u2019s really nothing else on the spark or the retail front that we see right now clearly, for the rest of the year. So that business is all about integrating Brooks and lucky into spark. And then obviously, we have a tremendous amount of work to do partner, Brookfield and the management team at penney to sustain their turnaround. And so we\u2019ve \u2013 our plate is full in that category. There won\u2019t be anything going on, on that front. And we\u2019re really \u2013 right now, we haven\u2019t really looked at anything external, because obviously, we got our hands full, but it is a testament to the company that, we can do penney, we can do our debt deal. We can shut down our properties, open them up deal with we\u2019ve done 14,000 lease amendments. right, Brian? Brian McDade : Yes. David Simon : we\u2019ve collected rent, that hasn\u2019t been easy. Okay. It\u2019s not like they just suddenly said, okay, I\u2019m going to send you a rent check that it hadn\u2019t been that easy. So, I mean, we\u2019ve been busy, obviously, we\u2019ve done a lot of refinancings on the secured front. We\u2019ve been doing just about \u2013 there we shut down the pipeline in terms of redevelopment. development brought it back up to some extent. So, I mean, we are \u2013 we got our hands full, I think we\u2019ve been executing unbelievably with all the \u2013 all of the things that have been thrown at us. So, we\u2019re really not looking externally at this moment. Michael Bilerman : It sounds like Brian has less hair now. David Simon : he \u2013 by the way, I think between Tom and Brian and Adam here, I\u2019m the only one with hair; however, depending on your vantage point, you may accuse me of being in the thoughts. So, okay. Let\u2019s move on. Let\u2019s move on. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche bank. Your question, please. Derek Johnston : Hi everyone. Good evening. Allied Esports, PARM, pinstripes, Soho House, and Nobu Hotels, how do you guys view these earlier pre-COVID investments and/or partnerships, and do you still believe them to be a viable path forward posting them and as we emerge from the pandemic or in effect, has the merchandising approach actually changed? David Simon : No. Look, obviously we wish \u2013 good question, and we obviously wish that the pandemic hasn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t hit us, but \u2013 and hit those businesses, but Soho has a great brand and ultimately, will be stronger and gets everything back online. So, the reality is very comfortable and they actually brought in some new capitals at the price that we did a couple of months ago, I think. So, Soho is great. PARM, we actually have Woodbury and Burlington opening next year, I think Woodbury\u2019s opening in January and Burlington in the spring, and my son and I and if Jeff Rosnick\u2019s [ph] listening, which I doubt he is, but we had a great carried out dinner at PARM. So, I\u2019d encourage everybody to go eat there, it was really good, chicken PARM dinner. I think it\u2019s a great brand; lifetime will be the survivor in that industry. I have all the confidence in the world, a great CEO, entrepreneur, great brand, great customer base. So, I think by and large, we feel like we\u2019re a pretty good spot. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think what\u2019s changed there, because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll do the little venture deals the way we did, even though we\u2019ve had some recent pops in those, meaning we got some, we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re selling our interest in the MDs at a profit and we\u2019ve \u2013 there\u2019s some new capital that\u2019s come into some of those businesses at prices higher than what came in. but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll do those little deals anymore. I think we\u2019ve got too much too much to say grace over. But I think all of that we\u2019ve invested in, we feel generally pretty good though. They\u2019ve all frankly \u2013 they\u2019re all fit the flywheel that we were creating. We just didn\u2019t anticipate, the black swans of black swans, and \u2013 but all of those companies are alive and I expect them to come out of it, okay. Derek Johnston : Okay, great. And sticking on some larger brands, are some of the brands you recently made lifeline investments? I know they were mentioned briefly lucky, Brooks Brothers, Forever 21. Will any merchandising additions and perhaps with Authentic drive a focused remerchandising mix at J. C. Penney and hopes to accelerate sales, is that on the table? David Simon : Great insight and the answer is absolutely. So that\u2019s one of the interesting things that we found is, we do think that the combination of our relationships with a direct-to-consumer crowd, as well as all the brands that either we control or that ABG does, that those products will find a home in Penney. And there\u2019s a lot of intense discussions going on. So, we would expect to enhance the Penney vendor matrix with the brands that ABG controls as well as ours. So very, very astute and the answer is without question. Derek Johnston : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Mike Mueller : Thanks. Can you tell us what the pro rata uncollectable reserve is that\u2019s in minimum rent for the quarter? David Simon : The pro-rata minimum rent in our joint ventures? Not sure. Mike Mueller : No. The pro rata, the uncollectable reserve, what it is our pro rata basis in the quarter? David Simon : We\u2019re really doing this on a gross basis, because that\u2019s how we look at it. Mike Mueller : Okay. And can you talk about how similar or different traffic and sales are at the outlets versus the malls? David Simon : The outlets are performing, I don\u2019t want to necessarily get into the specifics, but the outlets are performing better. What we\u2019ve seen across the board though, whether it\u2019s an outlet or an enclosed, if it does cater to tourism, those are ones that are continued to be \u2013 continued to underperform our average. So, whether it\u2019s in Orlando, enclosed or outlet, in Orlando, we have an enclosed mall there, we have the outlet centers that market both are underperforming with because of the lack of tourism and obviously, Universal and Disney operating at much less than full capacity. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Your question, please. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks for taking my question, David. David Simon : Sure. Floris van Dijkum : I had a question on Authentic Brands; you suggested they\u2019re going to step into the J. C. Penney deal with Brookfield and yourself. Would they be an equal partner or \u2013 and what pricing would they step in at the same price you guys bought? David Simon : Yes. the same price they will not be an equal partner, but they\u2019ll put in \u2013 we\u2019ll do see in our investment both us and Brookfield based upon the contribution they make. Floris van Dijkum : Great. And so how do you look at Authentic Brands, particularly, I mean, you talked a little bit about having their brands \u2013 selling their brands exclusively through the J.C. Penney outlets and increasing the J.C. Penney private sales it sounds like? David Simon : Well, I didn\u2019t say that\u2019s exclusive, but they have a \u2013 they control a number of brands, like Juicy Couture as an example. And they\u2019re \u2013 Juicy Couture is not in J.C. Penney. And so we\u2019re going through the vendor matrix now, to eventually, I think Penney will end up distributing those kinds of brands that ABG controls, J.C. Penney department store. So, it\u2019ll be a win-win for everybody. Floris van Dijkum : Okay. Maybe, my follow-up question with some of those brands as well, particularly as it relates to the outlet business. So, you mentioned your outlet business is doing quite well; obviously they\u2019re open air. So, they don\u2019t have quite the same restrictions. Maybe, if you can talk a little bit about how you think the outlet business could \u2013 is it still going to be as reliant on apparel going forward and how does Authentic Brands fit in and is Authentic Brands a tenant right now, or a large tenant in your outlet business and could they be in the future? David Simon : Authentic Brands is not really, I mean, they had some brands that we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not invested in, but they do have outlet stores now. They don\u2019t necessarily operate those stores, but take an example, Volcom, where they\u2019re a partner with Volcom. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not Simon Property is not investor in that, but they own the IP and they own part of the operations. But it\u2019s really; Volcom is used to be owned by Kering Group and then sold it. But they operate Volcom itself, operates outlet stores in our portfolio. So, they are not an operator of \u201cstores.\u201d ABG, but they do have \u2013 they do own intellectual property of certain brands that do operate stores in our outlets and that will continue, but that\u2019s been that way for years. So again, but we\u2019re not involved in everything that ABG does, like Joe and others. I mean, I do think a number of their brands do have store potential. And they\u2019ll either operate or find an operator operate those stores. And what was your other question? I\u2019m sorry. I forgot it. Floris van Dijkum : Yes. The other question David was in regards to the apparel, the severance of apparel and \u2013 do you see that changing overtime? David Simon : Look I think, generally, we\u2019re seeing a lot more interest in home furnishings and the life we\u2019re doing a lot more deals in the outlet sector with that \u2013 without naming names, but all the home furnishing and furniture folks. And so I think as you\u2019ve seen that shift generally speaking, I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of that pickup in the outlet business as well. Floris van Dijkum : Those typically would have the lower sales. Is that a concern for you, or do you think it\u2019s all about driving traffic at the center? David Simon : I think it\u2019s all about driving the traffic. I have no concern about that at all. And usually, those are a little big boxes, so that the rent that\u2019s leaving versus, what I\u2019d rather have a dress barn or an RH. okay. That\u2019s right. So, would I rather have \u2013 so that it says kind of trade-offs that I think are available to us. I think the mix actually will significantly impact \u2013 improve, because we\u2019re going to end up reclaiming some of the older less relevant brands for some of the good or the better brands. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Your question, please. Linda Tsai : Hi. Your overall leverage is much better than your peers, but net debt to NOI is a term understandably since 2019. What sort of leverage do you want to target and how would you expect this to trend in 2021? David Simon : Well, our leverage should \u2013 debt-to-EBTIDA should decrease, right. So, we\u2019re generating cash. Our development spend is modest and the excess cash other than dividend will ultimately, go to reduce our indebtedness, so \u2013 and we\u2019re also sell \u2013 we\u2019ll sell assets. So, we\u2019re still looking to essentially maintain our balance sheet. I mean, that\u2019s an advantage that we\u2019ve worked very hard to achieve, hasn\u2019t been easy and I would not \u2013 we\u2019re not going to blow that. Brian, you want to add anything? Brian McDade : No. We don\u2019t naturally come down next year, Linda, just given the recoup of NOI relative year-over-year. So, you will see us come back down to a more normalistic or a level consistent with prior periods is our expectation. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then in terms of the non-core assets that will be shed, albeit not a material impact, over what timeframe would this happen? Like, would you wait for some stabilization in NOI? David Simon : Well, I just think it\u2019s going to, we\u2019re \u2013 in fact, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got an asset now we\u2019re about the market. I mean, we\u2019re going to try and do it. I mean, we\u2019ll see, it\u2019s not \u2013 this isn\u2019t, this is not earth-shattering big projects, but there\u2019s \u2013 respect to shed, some non-core assets that won\u2019t have a \u2013 not going to have a material impact, but just it\u2019ll help us run the company better, because we won\u2019t have to focus on it. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then just one last one, in terms of the 85% collections in 3Q, do you think this will stay neutral in the neutral territory in your term, or would you expect bigger improvements? David Simon : Well, I would expect it to be hopefully, better in Q4. But we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re similar in October and \u2013 but obviously, I would hope that we \u2013 as I mentioned to you before we still got some bigger accounts that we have not made a lot of progress with. I\u2019m hopeful that something positive will happen there. So, once that happens, then it\u2019ll jump up. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your question, please. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So David, I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the environment for larger anchor box space; specifically, I\u2019m curious where it\u2019s coming from and how the spreads compared to the rest of you overall leasing? And now, are you able to run any commentary at all whether you\u2019ve leased any of that space to Amazon? Thanks. David Simon : Yes. Believe it or not, there are still deals to be done. I mean, we\u2019re talking to a department store to take a couple of boxes over, there\u2019s not going to be 30 to 40 deals, but there\u2019ll be 15 and I think our retail community is generally, the healthier companies are looking towards the future and believe in the \u2013 in having the right footprint and we\u2019re going to shrink the bad stores, but I think they\u2019re going to look at new opportunities. It\u2019s not going to \u2013 we still believe in the mixed use effort that we\u2019re undertaking. Obviously, we don\u2019t have to be in a rush to do it. And we\u2019re not going to build, we\u2019re looking at plans that maybe, had a 60,00, 70,000, a 100,000 square feet of new retail, small shop space, or you\u2019re not going to program that, but we\u2019ll make it up with boxes and the lower investment, and still manage the appropriate returns. So, there\u2019s still opportunity to release the space. Fact of the matter is we still don\u2019t own a lot of it that we want, but we\u2019re not going to pay appropriate prices for it and there\u2019s certainly a gap between the bid and the ask. We\u2019re really not bidding, and they\u2019re really not asking, but if we were to bid and they were to ask, it would be a big gap, but good real estate will survive. But it\u2019s going to take capital, great operator and it\u2019s not going to be for the faint of heart and \u2013 but it\u2019s going to be reprogrammed. So, just something jumps out like a Brea, we\u2019ll probably have, we always had two anchors, but we had this is the old Sears store that we control. We\u2019ll still do the two anchors there. But we probably programmed a 100,000 square feet of restaurants, small shops, and we\u2019re not going to do it. We\u2019ll probably do 2030, but the costs will go down and we still think we\u2019ll have the appropriate returns on investment. So, there\u2019s still stuff to do to improve our portfolio and there\u2019s still some decent demand on just box for box. Haendel St. Juste: Got it, got it. That\u2019s helpful. Are you able or willing to say if any of that leasing has been with Amazon specifically? David Simon : I didn\u2019t hear you well. Could you repeat it, please? Haendel St. Juste: Apologies. I was curious if you\u2019re able or willing to share any of that leasing has been specifically with Amazon. David Simon : There \u2013 we have no signed deal with Amazon. No. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And a follow-up on the leasing spreads in the quarter down another 400 basis sequentially minus 4% second quarter in a row. Was there anything having a disproportionate in that calculation during the quarter, when do you think that trough and I guess more broadly, how importantly, do you think having a vaccine effectively at hand will be during the ongoing lease negotiations and the near-term trajectory of leases as we build back to pre-COVID cash flow? Thank you. David Simon : Yes. I think the spread is really mixed, because we had some boxes that rolled out last year compared to this year. So, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s a number I wouldn\u2019t jump up and down whether it\u2019s really good or not so good as in this quarter, it\u2019s really a mix issue. Because we had a lot of box activity last year that we rolled out and this year, it\u2019s 12 months later. So, it\u2019s really more of a mixed issue and you could see that in our base rents increasing, which is probably a little more important stat. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. David Simon : Okay. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone from Green Street. Your question, please. Vince Tibone : Hi, good evening. I have a few questions related to co-tenancy clauses, when an anchor is tenant temporarily closed, like the movie theaters today, could that trigger a co-tenancy cause at your center? And then also more broadly, just can you help us understand what impact co-tenancy clauses have had on financials this year, if any? David Simon : Very little Vince, this year and we don\u2019t expect it to be meaningful or immaterial, let me restate it and say it better. It\u2019ll be in material next year. Vince Tibone : Yes. Okay. And then on this temporary point, like if the theater is temporary closed, is that potentially an issue on that front or what \u2013 I know it\u2019s hard to obtain much. David Simon : No, no. it\u2019s a more appropriate question. I think, of all of the theater closures at one deal and I can\u2019t remember which one that it may affect a co-tenancy at one of the mills for a few of the boxes. It\u2019s essentially immaterial. Vince Tibone : Okay. Thank you for that. And then I\u2019ll let you control J.C. Penney, and you\u2019re clearly bullish on the future there, but how are you thinking about the pace of potential story captured there some of your better centers and even in order to pursue redevelopment opportunities in the next few years? David Simon : Well, it hasn\u2019t closed. And in fact there was a hearing today, which I did not hear. I did not hear what happened, but to approve our \u2013 it\u2019s still not done yet. So, it hasn\u2019t closed assuming it gets approved. It\u2019ll be sometime later in the month. Look, it\u2019s complicated way. It\u2019s split up between what the operating company owns in the real estate and what the POSCO loans. We have rights. We, being Simon, have rights to recapture certain assets. So, does Brookfield, but I think we\u2019re going to be patient about it, because I think the most important thing right now is just to get it stabilized and positioned for the future, but eventually, there are certainly some stores that probably are not maybe, properly positioned with us, where we do want to recapture the space. And I think that\u2019s an opportunity, but you\u2019re not under \u2013 we don\u2019t feel the pressure to do that anytime soon. But that\u2019ll be next year\u2019s business. And then when that happens, I get to negotiate, I guess I don\u2019t really know what to do. Maybe risk, maybe our guys, maybe Brookfield. I\u2019m not really sure how it works, but we will, we will, we will appropriately do it fairly with all the constituencies involved. Vince Tibone : Okay. Thank you for that. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. I was just wondering how discussions are going with grocers given how strongly they performed in kind of their space to date with the COVID and how that\u2019s transpired. Have you seen traction in the various different format or kind of what is, are they most attracted to from the different types of assets that Simon owns and controls? David Simon : It\u2019s still reopened one in a specialty grocer in Boca. Just recently, that\u2019s doing very well. We just made a deal that I don\u2019t know that I can announce it that we just signed the lease this week to replace fairway, the fairway market grocer in Nanuet with a great grocer. So, there are \u2013 what we\u2019re really focused on is the specialty grocers as opposed to the big mammoth ones and I think there\u2019ll be a handful of deals. It\u2019s not going to be 50, but I think it will be over the next couple of years. There\u2019s no way we can\u2019t get 10 to 20 to specialty ones, like the one we did a bulk is great. It\u2019s sort of an end cap of kind of the lifestyle center that we did it Boca and high-end grocer in, come in, get your prepared foods, quality. You still have the Italy\u2019s of the world that are out there looking to do a business. I had a comment with them recently, that\u2019s the same kind of category, prepared foods, specialty grocer, not necessarily a place; I guess you could pick up milk, but, more of prepared foods, dining or get your special consumable. So, I do think that\u2019ll continue to grow. Juan Sanabria : Great. And a follow-up from me. You kind of talked about acquiring some assets, high quality retail. Have you looked at, or any interest in some of the Westfield centers given what they\u2019re trying to do at the corporate level? David Simon : No. I mean, they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing, so nothing there to report. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Truist. Your question, please. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. You\u2019ve provided a helpful bridge looking at the portfolio NOI from last year to this year? One of the biggest components of that was that $270 million you mentioned. And it\u2019s a big number. I was just wondering if there\u2019s any kind of breakdown you can provide on the call? David Simon : Well, it\u2019s a combination, as I said, of abatements and credit provisions. The credit provisions are mostly bankruptcies. How is it split, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 60/40 somewhere in that range. Is that \u2013 if that\u2019s helpful to you, again, I don\u2019t \u2013 I view this as kind of a one \u2013 this is not going to be routine, but it\u2019s kind of a one-time between the COVID impact, so to speak between Q2 and Q3, but it\u2019s split roughly between abatements and credit provisions, which are mostly bankruptcies and abatements, and maybe, it\u2019s 60/40 in that range. Is that helpful? Ki Bin Kim : It is. And are you incorporating tenants on the watch list that are not being corrupt or not near-term bankrupt? David Simon : Credit provisions include lots of things beyond prepetition rent or anything else associated with a bankruptcy. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just given the news today about the vaccine from Pfizer, does that make any kind of impact in terms of your mentality when it comes to lease negotiations? I know it\u2019s early, but just curious. David Simon : Not really. I mean, listen, I \u2013 before the news today, I mean, we were feeling better that we had dealt with a lot of crap in Q2 and Q3, and we\u2019re here to \u2013 and we\u2019re here and our cash flows dramatically up and our collections are up, and we\u2019re getting our business back to normal. So, we were headed that way anyway. But obviously, it\u2019s \u2013 just I mean, this situation, is it black swan times two or three and it\u2019s been sad for all of us to have to see what\u2019s happened to the country good solid businesses beforehand that we\u2019ve had to deal with our employees, obviously, all the people, in fact, \u2013 just maybe, there\u2019s a little more of what\u2019s the trays of peppermint \u2013 what\u2019s that? Brian McDade : Pep in the step. David Simon : Pep in the step, I just think it\u2019s good news. Let\u2019s hope we can \u2013 let\u2019s hope we can get out and get done. But now, it\u2019s not going to \u2013 it\u2019s not going to affect us, because we\u2019re mostly dealing with COVID-oriented shutdowns or impact of those shutdowns. And listen I hope it gives our client face more confidence and that that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s good. It should, it should. And hopefully, we\u2019ll see some benefits from that into 2021 and beyond. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question edition of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to David Simon for any further remarks. David Simon : Okay. Thank you and thanks for staying late on a Monday night. be well. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Okay. Good evening. As all of us know, 2020 was a difficult year for all of those affected by COVID-19, including our company. Even with the unprecedented operating environment, we accomplished a great deal. We earned $9.11 per diluted share and funds from operation for the full-year, which includes $0.06 per share dilution from our recent equity offering in November. We generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow. We acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group, made strategic investments in several widely recognized retail brands at attractive valuations, and have already made significant progress in repositioning each brand and increasing their operating cash flow. We raised over $13 billion in debt and equity markets, opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others, completed three domestic redevelopments, abated rent for thousands of small and local businesses, regional entrepreneurs, and restaurateurs who frankly needed our help to survive, paid $700 million in real estate taxes, which unbelievably was an increase from 2019 despite losing approximately 13,500 shopping days in our domestic portfolio during the year due to the restrictive governmental orders placed upon us, and that's roughly 20% of the whole year, to put it in perspective, and we returned $2 billion in cash to our shareholders in dividends. These results and frankly, these accomplishments are a testament to the entire team, Simon team for the resilience, relentless focus on operations and cost structure, and the safety of the communities we serve, and obviously, focused on giving back to the communities in terms of what we did from abatement and real estate tax point of view. Now, let's go to the fourth quarter and then we're going to turn the page. Fourth quarter FFO was $787 million, that\u2019s $2.17 per share, obviously, that was affected by the dilution of our equity offering that I mentioned. I'm pleased that to report that with the solid profitability and the $900 million in operating cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter, our domestic international operations in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately a net $0.95 per diluted share, primarily due to the reduced lease income, including sales base rents and other property revenues caused by COVID-19 disruption and $0.06 also from the international operations due to various restrictions placed upon those properties. Collection from our U.S. retail portfolio continue to improve. As of last week, we've collected 90% of our net build rents for the second, third, and fourth quarters combined. We made significant progress in the fourth quarter and addressing previously unresolved amounts with certain large tenants. We still, even to this day, have a handful of large tenants. Unfortunately, we've yet to resolve their receivables and we are hopeful that - and we anticipate resolving those certainly in the next few weeks. And you can review the collection details in our press release that we issued. Now, let me walk through as I have for Q2, Q3 and Q4, the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter in the context of our portfolio NOI presentation, which you can find on Page 17. Again, to remind you, these are on a gross basis and not a company share. Last year, our NOI was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. This year, it's $1.2 billion, that's a decrease of 23.9%, or approximately $380 million. And here are the components of the decline : $220 million in aggregate from domestic rent abatements and higher uncollectable rents, primarily associated with retail bankruptcies. And this is an important reminder, we do not amortize any of the abatements even though through FASB, you could, we chose to write those off in the period that they were granted. And hence, they affect our lease income in the period that we decided to go ahead and grant the abatement. Approximately, $205 million from lower minimum rents reimbursement short-term leasing, ancillary property revenues, and terminations associated with bankruptcy, tenants and lower sales volume due to COVID-19 disruption, obviously, lots of government restrictions on restaurants and amount of people we could have in the properties. And just as a reminder to you, we have a great deal of seasonality in the fourth quarter. So obviously, the card kiosk overage rent was impacted by, again, the immense restrictions that we had in terms of operating our portfolio by government mandates. And then we offset some of that decline by our diligent cost reduction initiatives. Operating metrics at the fourth quarter was basically flat compared to the third quarter 2020, and we were down year-over-year. Average base minimum rent was $55.80, up 2.2% for the year. Leasing spreads declined primarily as a function of mix. We had some boxes last year that rolled out and are no longer in the 12-month reporting period. Good news is leasing momentum is continuing. We signed over 1,400 leases representing 6 million square feet and have a number of significant - number of leases in our pipeline. And that's a testament to our quality of our real estate. And I do think we're starting to see our retailers get back to what they do best, and that is operate stores. We opened two new outlets, frankly, in Spain and Bangkok, which we're proud of. We have an outlet under construction in England, which will open this spring. Redevelopments, as I mentioned to you, we completed a number of properties. We also added, which is essentially the Woodbury of Asia, Gotemba Outlet expansion, another 178,000 square feet, and another property in Japan, adding another 110,000 square feet. So look for those to add to our cash flow in future years. We continue to densify our centers with the opening of a multi-family residential complex and hotel. We also have three hotels under construction. We completed the redevelopment and - of another Northshore mall and we started construction on expansion in Naples. So we're back to focused on continuing to add improvements across our portfolio worldwide. We also have a pipeline as you know, redevelopment, new development that is under consideration. Now, let me just turn to our retail investments. And I think and I hope this puts all of this in proper perspective. Obviously, we have an unbelievable track record in capital allocation, making significant returns on investment. During the year, we capitalized on buying four recognized retail brands in bankruptcy, so we bought them at attractive valuations. They include Forever 21, Lucky Brands, Brooks Brothers and Penney, each of these brands we believe presents a very interesting repositioning opportunity and each investment has completed at attractive valuations and we\u2019ve made significant progress improving the positioning and operating results of the company. And let me just give Forever 21 as an example. And as you know, we bought it in February pre-COVID, well before we knew COVID would have the impact it did on 2020. And despite all of that, despite all of that, Forever 21, both in the company, generated a positive EBITDA, pre-royalties, of approximately $75 million in 2020, and we basically paid $67 million for that. So our share of that is $30 million, and you can divide it by $67 million to give you our return on investment in COVID 2020. Now, you could probably conclude that that's a pretty good return on investment. Now, if you put all of our retail brand investments in context, we have approximately $330 million remaining invested capital net of cash distributions and the value of appreciation of our ABG investment, which has just had a recent trade. And so, in marking that to market, our net investment in all of these activities is $330 million, and all of these brands will generate for us in 2021, our share, $260 million of EBITDA, so you can take $260 million divided by $330 million, will give you sets of our return on investment. Now, I want to remind everyone that we do not add back depreciation associated with these retailer investments to our FFO because it's not real property. So the contribution of that from an earnings point of view will obviously be much less with the EBITDA, is the EBITDA. So the other point to make in these retail investments is all of these brands generate $3.5 billion in digital sales, $3.5 billion in digital sales. And all we have to do is look at how e-commerce brands are being valued today and I think you could all conclude, we hope you do, that we've been making some wise investments here. Now, with respect to Taubman, I'm very pleased to have completed the transaction for 80% TRG and their premier retail portfolio, asset portfolio, our teams have worked - started working together. In fact, I'm up, I can't wait to go to Detroit tomorrow night in the cold and snow, it's slightly colder than Indianapolis but I'm sure I'll be welcome. And we're off to a very productive good spirited start. I really do look forward to the partnership and growth inherent in the portfolio and I think we'll all work very well together. As many of you know, we recently filed the Form S-1 with the SEC to raise $300 million and a Simon sponsored Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation i.e. SPAC. We are currently in a quiet period for the filing and are unable to speak to it about the proposed offering at this time. We've been very active in the debt and equity capital markets raising $13 billion in the last 12 or so months. And just some highlights, amended and extended our credit facility with a $6 billion facility that included a $2 billion term loan which was used to fund the Taubman transaction, issued $3.5 billion of senior notes including the recent $1.5 billion offer in January. Addressing all of our 21 unsecured maturities and obviously before the treasury really moved up. We completed seven 15 secured loan financings, refinancings for $2 billion. And again in November we completed the common stock issuance of 22 million shares for $1.56 billion. Debt to the term loan funded the Taubman deal. And our net debt was flat compared to last year exclusive of the properties that we added with the Taubman transaction and the term loan drawdown. Fourth quarter, we ended our liquidity with $8.2 billion consisting about a $1,005 billion of cash including our share of joint venture, and $6.7 billion available credit facility. This is net of $623 million of commercial paper outstanding quarter end. Dividend, we paid our fourth quarter dividend of $1.30 per share which is $6 in total for the year. We paid more than $2 billion in 2020, we're up to over $34 billion in dividends of our history as a public company and we're really proud that we paid the cash dividend when many of our other companies either suspended or completely eliminated or dramatically reduced their dividend. Now, finally, let's move on to 2021 because I do frankly want to turn the page on 2020 as I'm sure we all - as you all do, we feel confident we've turned the corner. We expect growth in cash flow and earnings in 2021. Our guidance is $9.50 to $9.75 per share. This range includes approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share from our retailer investments. Again, keep in mind that we can't add back or we don't add back depreciation for those investments. That's our growth range of 4.3% to 7% compared to our full year of 9.11% and just no more - our diluted share count will be 3.76%, no significant acquisition or disposition activity and no further government mandate shutdown of our domestic retail properties is in that guidance. As you know, we are dealing certain shutdowns in Europe as we speak. So, let me just conclude. One heck of a year, let's not repeat it in any stretch of our imagination. Let's turn the corner. And I want to thank my Simon colleagues for their continued resolve in running our business under these trying circumstances in a very tough environment. We dealt with just basically about everything. And I want to thank them. And again thank our shareholders for their support. And everyone out there be well. And we're ready for any and all questions though, I'm sure people want to go home and warm up because it's cold. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good afternoon, David, or good evening. David Simon : Good, good. Steve Sakwa : I guess, first, I just wanted to maybe talk a little bit about the leasing momentum and pipeline that you talked about. And just - given that things are moving forward, the economy seems to be getting better. Vaccines are getting rolled out. We're not completely out of the woods, but certainly, there's light at the end of the tunnel here. What sort of discussions are you and the retailers having about unresolved leases, and maybe more importantly, new leases to backfill the vacancy that got created over the last sort of 12 to 18 months? David Simon : Well, look, I think we\u2019re - as I said to you, we\u2019re expecting to grow our cash flow. Are we back to normal? Not yet, but we're working our way back. Generally, it's still a very serious, intense negotiation on renewals. Retailers are generally cautious. But the ones that want to grow their business are excited, and we hope to be able to certainly increase our occupancy for 2021. And it's going to take some time to obviously get back to where we were in 2019. But the healthy retailers that believe in their business and believe in their plan are making deals, and that we have such a high-quality portfolio between what we have and what we've acquired with respect to TRG that we're going to be - we're going to get our fair share of open-to-buys. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, I appreciate some of the comments you made around the guidance which I was a little surprised at the tightness of the range just given the uncertainties out there. But is there anything else you can sort of provide? And I realize there is a lot of inputs that go into that number or in that range of numbers? But anything just on same-store growth or occupancy or lease spreads just to give us a little bit of a feel for how much of the deferrals that you provided or abatements kind of come back on line in 2021? David Simon : Well, certainly, the abatements better not repeat, okay? So that's step one. I would say to you generally, again, it's - our portfolio NOI growth will be 4% to 5%. We have taken a further reserve, but I'm not going to give you a number as to what we think should be a cushion to whether whatever it is further bankruptcies, additional abatements to the extent that we cut an appropriate deal, we still have some large retailers frustratingly we have not solved. Not because of us, we've tried, but we haven't gotten into the finish line. So I'd say generally around 5% in the comp NOI number. We have a reserve. Sales are really all over the place, so it's really hard to give you a good number there. And we would expect occupancy to edge up. And I gave you - people wanted to hear about how much was retail or I gave you that and we have TRG factored in there. Obviously, we made our financing assumptions. Those were pretty straightforward. We have our share count increased because of the offering. And then we roll it into the blender and that's kind of what's spit out. We have some variability. You're right, the range is tight, but we did - I mean, we did add a reserve to it based upon gut feel that we're, like you said, not - we're turning the corner, it's kind of my phrase, but are we completely out of the woods? Not yet, but well on our way. Steve Sakwa : That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Hey, good evening, David. Thanks for your time this evening. I want to maybe just spend a little bit more time walking through the line item where Taubman and some of your other investments are held, not because I'm questioning them. I actually think they're becoming increasingly important. So could you just maybe walk us through how we're supposed to think about that line item relative to the full FFO guide for 2021? And maybe how you think you can grow that line item even after 2021 and 2022 and 2023? Because I recognize there's just a lot in there and it seems increasingly important? David Simon : Well, look, it flows through - listen, I used to - I'm still pretty good at it, but it flows through our equity. They're all equity accounted, so now in - we show a couple of different things. So we do separate out our retail NOI in our supplemental, so we do, do that. TRG will be in our property NOI next year. We had - we took no financial implications for TRG in the fourth quarter, obviously, I think we owned it for like 12 minutes, right? When did it close? Brian McDade : 29th. Adam Reuille : 29th. David Simon : 29th all right, I see. I'm always faster than what it is. We took no other than, obviously, our debt increase at the year-end, because we drew down on the term loan to fund it. But from a GAAP point of view, it will be in the equity, all lumped together with our other equity investments. But in our supplemental, we\u2019ll have TRG in our portfolio NOI, and the retailer will be in that separate line item. Guys, you want to add anything else? Brian McDade : No, that\u2019s exactly right. You'll see the retailer results that David mentioned come through the NOI from retailers at this line item, Rick. Rich Hill : Okay. I think I understand that. Brian McDade : Yes. Rich Hill : And, David, obviously, as you said, 2020 has been a remarkably abnormal year. But you've been in a really interesting position whereby you've been able to buy some retailers and negotiate retailers - with retailers. Could you maybe just walk through some of the biggest lessons learned about who you want to be your tenants, how you negotiate with them, how they negotiate with you? I just think it's important as we think about how to model cash flows in the out years? David Simon : Well, I mean, that's a tough one, Rich. I mean I could go in a lot of different directions. Listen, when you end up in bankruptcy or near bankruptcy, you've obviously made a lot of mistakes. It just doesn't happen overnight. And by and large, the ones that we bought, retailers that we have bought in bankruptcy. So then we go in there and just run it like we run Simon Property Group, obviously, with the help of our partners.  And we make fast, commonsensical cash flow-oriented decisions and return on investments, et cetera. And we have a sense of, just because of our experience in the retail real estate world, what makes it successful, what success real estate they should be in, what's the right rent to pay in spaces and we bring all those - all that to bear. And then obviously, when you're in bankruptcy, you have the chance to deal with leases or other contracts, other contracts that are wildly expensive that you might be able to change. I mean, the most amazing thing, I shouldn't really say this, but there - the most amazing thing is that every retailer that we purchased in bankruptcy, the one - all the tech companies get $0.100 on the $1, okay, that they pay for whether it's services, whether it's for the e-commerce business, whatever it is. And the landlords ended up us included end up getting it in the shorts that's an interesting thing. That would be great to like rethink that whole process. But there - those tech companies are so powerful that they can check you off if you don't play ball with them. So landlords, us included, don't have that kind of power. So I mean, I don't know if I've answered your question. It probably is. You probably have a lot of nuances to it but it's probably I could go on for hours. If you don't mind, let's go on to your next question or another question. Rich Hill : Yes, no. That's it for me, David. We can discuss offline. Just seems like there's a lot of really interesting drivers of growth here and we're trying to get our arms around it. So thank you. I'll get back in the queue. I don\u2019t have any questions. So, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Good evening David and hope you're enjoying the snow out there. David Simon : It's pretty. It gets less pretty when it gets closer to March let me assure. Yes. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. The skiing gets better or so, that\u2019s positive. And so two questions here. First, in the fourth quarter it looks like on your - on that rent collections you have a 90% table that you guys have. It looks like the bankruptcy is leveled off the deferrals, leveled off. And it looks like you guys took about $141 million of abatements in the quarter. Also I noticed that your - you had a big straight line right off and then you had a big lease term. So it seems like there was a lot of cleanup in the fourth quarter. Is that the way that we should interpret it, like basically you guys got to the end of the year, you shouted up and down the hall, say, what do we got here. Let's clean the books and start 2021 in a good way. Or is that not the right interpretation, because you didn't say what the actual operating guidance for this year, you just said you're lobbying for it. But it does seem like you guys cleaned up a lot at year end. David Simon : Well, the bottom line is, when it came to abatements we took it in the period that we actually made the deal. And if we had done everything in the second quarter, we would have done it then in the Q3 with. It just took an unbelievable amount of time to get - I mean there was a lot of horse trading, a lot of big accounts got settled as you know in Q4. And it really, I mean, we - it really was when the deal was done. So that's the - yes, we certainly want to go into 2021 and we did as much as we could to finish 2020, but those abatements were done in the period at which we cut the deal and signed up the retailer. Alexander Goldfarb : So we shouldn't interpret the acceleration in the fourth quarter as lingering into this year, it was just stuff done in the quarter? David Simon : As I think I said there is some negotiations that we still have left to do but I think we dealt with that in a sense in 2020 based on kind of where the deal was headed. So we did use some judgment at year-end in a couple of these cases. But it isn\u2019t done until the cash comes into my bank account, not mine, that was terrible. My bank account at the Simon Property Group representative, okay, so make that perfectly clear, okay? Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. It's just as clear. Second question is you always treasure your balance sheet and Moody's already downgraded you back ahead of the third quarter earnings. S&P still has you on negative watch. So just the question here as you guys think about your balance sheet. I mean, on one hand, your debt trades wider than what the ratings would indicate. Obviously, the bond guys want to get the best deal that they can. At the other hand, you guys can access the market. But still how - I mean, if something were to happen, you've got like a two-notch downgrade. Is that - I mean, it almost seems like the market is pricing that in. But on the other hand, you guys got a ton of debt that you were able to issue. So can you just give us some color on, like, the buyers of the debt and how the debt people are looking at it? Are they just trying to get their ounce of flesh while they can? And the way that you've outlined your plan to the rating agencies you'll be able to maintain something that starts with an A, or are there other concerns out there that people are or that the rating agencies are talking to you about that you need to address? Brian McDade : Alex, this is Brian. Look, I think the last debt deal we just did in here at the beginning of January is representative of where we've seen our spreads go. I mean, spreads were in 100 basis points since the summertime. And so I think that the market is representing and supporting time and kind of going forward. With respect to the agencies, we are certainly in deep dialogue with them on regular basis and are comfortable with what they've done thus far, and I think they're looking at our deals and our ability to raise capital, to David's point, in excess of $13 billion last year, as a testament to the company's balance sheet. So I think they're comfortable. Won\u2019t speak for them, but I believe they're comfortable where they're at right now. David Simon : Yes. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Brian McDade : There's just no way we're going to get downgraded, not a chance. So next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : So what have you learned about traffic, your tenants, and demand and most specifically in the centers within space that have less mandate restrictions? Are there any inspiring read-throughs or green shoots for those centers with tighter restrictions, let\u2019s say California or North East that you can pinpoint or share? David Simon : Well, I would say, you take a state like Florida as a pretty good example. And I mean, you are getting - the one element that's missing is international tourism. But if you put that aside, you're getting some real domestic traffic increases and you're getting - and sales aren't quite what they were last year. But at this time, what you're seeing - I would say to you that like a state like Florida is really showing green shoots, vibrant economy. The only element that's missing to make that really hot would be international tourism. But everything else is kind of clicking along and it\u2019s pretty good. Texas is probably the next closest, but again, it depends. I mean, they're - that also somewhat dependent upon whether it's near the border or not. And what is such a big state that do you have COVID in this one area versus that area. But I'd say Texas is showing green shoots as well. But Florida is a great example of I would say to you that you can - you can\u2019t get on with goodness and you start to see green shoots and the - there's a lot of energy there. And no, I did not get on Super Bowl, okay. Derek Johnston : So we did go back, David, to 3Q 2019 and this was the last quarter before the pandemic was known. At that time, the redevelopment buzz and pivot to experiential and mixed use concepts. It was really high and that's the redevelopment pipeline stood at the record $1.8 billion. So how is this pipeline and redevelopment priorities changed besides being much lower? And how do you stack or prioritize redevelopment spend, especially as we see the pandemic escape velocity in front of us later this year? Thank you. David Simon : Yes, sure. I'd say simplistically, as we look at restarting the pipe, the pipe didn't go away. We just put it in the freezer. Now we're thawing it out. And I would say to you the biggest change Derek is that we believe in the mixed use component pretty, pretty significantly to the extent that we were adding what I'd call retail. We're probably looking at those plans again to make sure that we're adding the appropriate amount, that's kind of the biggest change. But I would tell you this, I do feel very strongly about this that the high quality suburbs are going to be where the action is in the future. And all of the urbanization two, three, four years ago, the question was why are the suburbs going to exist. Everybody is going to live in urban environment, yadda yadda, yadda, yadda. I'm telling you the suburbs are going to be hot, and our quality real estate is going to be where the action is for those well located suburban centers of commerce. And that's going to be the big change coming out of the pandemic. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : David, my first question is just sort of just talking more broadly about vertical integration. And I know you can't talk about the fact that's been under review right now. But can you talk just a little bit broadly about doing things on balance sheet versus in joint ventures or other structures. And maybe just provide, give an update on some of the retail investments, and maybe give an update too on shopping outlets and how that was set up conveniently before the pandemic and how that has happened. And maybe just tie everything together to the vertical integration and being able to control a little bit more of your own destiny. David Simon : Well, listen, I would say that we - whatever we do we look at return on investment and cash flow potential - shareholder value potential and cash flow growth, and obviously top line growth. And each business is evaluated based upon what those particular characteristics are important to that investment. But there\u2019s no reason. You know we\u2019re in a REIT format. There's no reason why we can't make money in other areas that are consistent with what we've been doing. I think we've proven that time and again. Have we made mistakes? Yes, we have. But we've been pretty good investors, and we hope to do that in the future. We're pretty good sponsors, and we have - our relationships between the brands and our partners and - spans the globe, essentially. From a real estate footprint, we're in Europe and Asia, and obviously domestic. The only place I'd say we're really not in is South America. But our retail brands span a lot of places, and we're focused on value. And at the end of the day, Michael, I look at our retail footprint. It does $3.5 billion of commerce, and I look at the value we get for it, and it's probably nothing, and in some cases people view it as a negative, which I can't understand, but they do. That's their prerogative. Maybe there's something maybe we should unlock that value, we\u2019re absolutely going to look at every opportunity to unlock value to the extent we can but we - and figure out the right structure. But the most important thing is to make a good investment. The second thing that is where it should reside, how do you get the value, how do you grow it? And all of those are in the works. Spark is a great example. We believe in the model. We can - we believe that we can run brands across it common infrastructure. We know that e-commerce brands, they spend a lot of money on infrastructure. We know that if you combine those into one entity, you're bound to save a ton of money. We've seen it in the overhead in retail companies, so you know we're at the early days of figuring out what the right structure is. But in the meantime, we're going to make investments that make us money. And believe me, there is value there that will unlock or we'll get the credit for. Michael Bilerman : And then just the same question just in terms of guidance and I greatly appreciate the transparency of actually putting out a number of guidance which didn't have an answer going on, it's great. If you think about just sort of the building blocks to that guidance, if you look at 2019 relative to 2020, right, you had that $2.50 per share or almost $3 a share, well over a $1 billion decline. You\u2019re picking up at least $200 million going from 2021. But I almost want to think a couple of years of getting back to NOI and FFO and bridging that gap. You threw out $0.15 to $0.20 of retailer investments per page 17. It looks like that was pre-DNA about $0.06. So call it 10 of the 50 increase is coming at least from the retailer side and the positive investments you've made. But maybe you can just sort of break down some of the other bigger components of what's coming back. I'm not - I don't need specific G&A guidance or NOI but there's obviously a pretty big moat of earnings to get back. And maybe you can just share some of the bigger piece of those. Brian McDade : I mean, look, I think the biggest thing is not to replicate the abatements and the bankruptcies. I mean that's the biggest component. But look, our portfolio, again at gross not at share, did over $6 billion in 2019. Right? We lost a $1 billion. And all of the stuff that we did net. And again we\u2019ve worked our unit to what off to mitigate that through cost savings. What's not going to replicate or the cost savings in a sense and the abatements. And we were pretty aggressive in running the ship as lean and as high as we could. And we had no choice even though people across the street were open, we weren't allowed. So we have a $1 billion to make up. Again, this is pre-TRG and I think the biggest thing is going to be the campaigns of the big unknown is how long is it going to take to get lease up, we lost 3 - 350 basis points, 3, what, 380 basis points? David Simon : 380 basis points. Brian McDade : 380 basis points, so we loss 380 basis points on occupancy sales in our vaccine rollout and everything else. I mean, we did our roll up our best guess, our comp NOI is going to be positive. And we've got a reserve but at the end of the day, we're going to make the $1 billion up over time. We're also going to - some of the properties we're going to sell, go away, so that's in there, too. I can't give you - Steve Sakwa kind of poured out and we already gave you - he gave me more - he's got a nicer voice than you do. So I gave him more information than I probably normally would. I'm not kidding. But I mean, that's kind of where we are. We also - we're also dealing with the international shutdown. I mean, they're picking on malls like what happened in the U.S., again without science. But they're also shutting down outlets. But yet they high street open, so go figure it out. Michael Bilerman : Yes. Brian McDade : So we're still dealing with some crap everywhere. But I mean, I'd say the big thing that won't replicate. We hope is in the abatements, but it's taking on the cost savings and sales and then build up the lease income and bad debt, we put all these numbers in. We also put a reserve just because we have a lot of uncertainty, and we put it in the blender, and that spits out. Can\u2019t add much more than that? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Craig Schmidt : I had a question about the redevelopments in the U.S. Should you put your [Rick Sokolov] and kind of run through who you're thinking is possible anchor replacements I realized they may not be retail. They could be wellness, healthcare or e-sports, or whoever. But who are some of the replacement anchors you're thinking in terms of your U.S. redevelopments? David Simon : Well, I mean, Craig, that\u2019s a retail - yes I mean, I'm sorry, real estate-specific. But I think what I said earlier is the most important thing. I think some of these we\u2019re re-looking at, with the idea toward reducing the amount of new retail that we might put on board. But also the restaurants and we're making up for that with what I'd call the opportunity for suburbs to get exciting again, and I think that's going to be through a lot of the mixed-use efforts that were already under way. But I think will be accelerated. So, some of the anchors are doing - new deals. I mean, we're talking to Kohl\u2019s. We're talking to [Buy More]. We\u2019re talking to all sorts of those kind of guys, to Dick\u2019s. We still are making new - we've got a couple of Dick\u2019s under way. So and I would hope that some of the more thoughtful entertainment-oriented retailers once the COVID restrictions get back, would also continue to be in our property. So it\u2019s still at work, but I'm hopeful we'll have a lot more of the mixed SKU stuff that we're doing and we're in some hot what I'll call very strong markets for that. Like with TRG in Nashville, we're in Austin. We're very strong in South Florida, obviously Texas. So we're in some of these markets that rent growth and are looking to facilitate growth and we're going to go and make the next evolution of our real estate that's much more interesting with time. Craig Schmidt : And then I'm just curious how are you interacting with the Taubman management given their properties? And how are they interfacing with the Simon people? David Simon : I\u2019d say fantastic. We are on the leasing side talking significantly, both on COVID-related issues, renewal-related issues, new business, as you know, Craig we\u2019ve got new business group dedicated kind of up and coming retailers which by the way, it\u2019s exciting. All of those retailers and this is where I do miss Rick. He could start and your kind to mention him. But I will never do his list. I could never do adjust this. But most of those retailers are looking to grow. And they include from the Warby Parker to Shake Shack on and on. So that's very encouraging. We're talking to the TRG, about that relationship between Bobby and myself is great. In fact well Bobby, he figures out how to get to me very easily. He makes me look a lot with - which is fantastic. I look forward to having some tomorrow night. And I think it's going to be a great partnership. I mean they're dealing with what we've dealt with. In terms of COVID it\u2019s been a tough year for them, but I think we're all looking forward to the future. And we'll go from there. And as you know, they've got - the families got a lot of capital tied up from the TRG and believe me they want to grow that. And to me that's a win-win. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe just on the balance sheet side, could you clarify whether the Taubman debt is included in the debt metrics on Page 29 of the supplement? And if it's not, is it just because it happened so close to the quarter end or something else? Brian McDade : Hi Caitlin, this is Brian. It is not included. The only debt that will be included relative to Taubman will be $2 billion term loan that we drew down ahead of the closure. Caitlin Burrows : And then going forward will it be reflected more similar to other joint ventures that we have or not? Brian McDade : Yes, it absolutely will. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. And then this quarter the metric you guys had shown in the past on debt NOI looks like that's not there anymore. But I think it's about seven times using the net debt from Page 28 and the NOI from Page 17. So I'm wondering, A) would it be higher when including the Taubman portion of those metrics and also what\u2019s your near and medium term targets for leverage? David Simon : Yes, that well, the fact of the matter is, I think that statistic you have to be very careful with. And I personally chose that I think we need to look at it again because as you know many of those properties are non-recourse and it overstates leverage. And I think part of our job is to educate the investment community how we look at the business. And Brian and myself, we'll begin that effort this year. But you know look EBITDA - debt to EBITDA, if you look at our - it's not in our financial covenants anywhere. So it's a gratuitous metric that is not as thoughtful as refined as it should be. And we're in the process of refining it to clearly articulate what it is. But you've got to separate what's recourse, non-recourse. What\u2019s in JV, what\u2019s not in JV in a more thoughtful manner, which we\u2019ll embark upon in 2021 so you\u2019ll have a better understanding of it. Caitlin Burrows : And then I guess just considering where that leverage is and you'll educate us on how we should think about it. What's your current interest in making property-level acquisitions in 2021 or under what conditions would you consider raising additional equity? David Simon : We have no need for raising additional equity. The balance sheet is in very good shape. Rating agencies are very comfortable with the transaction that we did both to finance, Taubman and the equity deal. Obviously, they put us on watch just because of COVID. It had nothing to do with Taubman or the financial metrics. And I think as we get - as we go beyond the shutdown - remember, we lost 20%. We lost 20% of our ability to operate in the year which is material. And then obviously a lot - not counting the, restrictions that we had to endure coming out of it. I think once we show that we're - we've turned the corner in terms of that, you'll see that negative watch go away. No issue not worried about it one [iota]. And on the property acquisition side, A) if I can buy it at a good value and it's a great asset and a guy wants to sell and if that\u2019s meaningful to our portfolio, we'll take a serious look. But we\u2019re in no - there's no need to do one thing or another, if it's accretive to our portfolio and our financial wherewithal, we\u2019re happy to look at it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just a question on sources and used cases, you continue to pay the dividend but at a lower rate than previously, you expect cash flows to go up. So any color or thoughts you can give us around the dividend going forward and other maybe use of the capital? I'm not sure if you have a sense of what could be contributed or used to further invest in retailers at this point, so maybe just a general conversation in sources and uses and then touching on the dividend. Brian McDade : Well, again, our net investment in retail is $330 million. So I think when we have properties that were worth a $1 billion plus, it is what it is. I think it's important to note that we are 400 basis points below our mean FFO multiple as a history of being a public company. And if you look at our retail or what we've seen from retailers and the correlation, they've all had a much greater bounce back in terms of performance on the in terms of performance on the - on their stock year-to-date for the last few quarters than we have. So, we're optimistic that the future will begin to - that are our value will begin to be appreciated again which has been in the past. And frankly, there's no reason why it won't in the future. With respect to this - and the reason I bring up the past is as follows. If you'll look, we work the best case analogy that we're looking at. Again, no one has really dealt with COVID before. And as you know what happened in 2008, 2009 where we had - don't hold exactly to those - these numbers. But in 2008 we were earning around $6 a share. Our 2008, 2009 bankruptcies delusion that we had on issuing stock, high interest rates, I think we earned in the $3.50, $4 range. And then we ended up rolling out of that earning $12 dollars. Okay. Now we're at $9 - we are $9.11. We're saying we're going to earn $9.50 to $9.75. And I'm hopeful that will replicate what we did in 2008, 2009. And not only that we do in 2008 and 2009, but we added immensely to the quality of the real estate. We separated ourselves from our peer group dramatically. The balance sheet got better. All of these same - we diversified, we did this, that, and the other, we grew international - I truly believe all of these things will happen again. That\u2019s what we\u2019re made for, and this is a long way of saying that the dividend tracked basically what we did in earnings. We actually paid scrip dividend in 2009, if you believe it or not. We cut it and scripted it and did all this crazy stuff. And that was - all of that in 2008-2009. I feel like if history repeats itself, given the quality of the real estate, the team, the balance sheet, the diversity, we are going to replicate the same good work we did coming out of that, and we'll do it coming out of COVID. We're already beginning to do it, and that's the important thing. So I think that's a long way of saying, assuming we can completely get out of COVID, you're going to see increases in earnings which beget increases in dividends. And we have the history that ultimately should repeat itself. Juan Sanabria : Thanks for that. And then just my follow-up on the lease term, can you give us any sense on how lease terms have changed, if at all, during the last few months in your discussions with retailers either for new or renewals, and how maybe that trended over periods of past dislocation, whether it be the financial crisis or the tech wrecking? Just the perspective historically would be helpful. David Simon : Yes, sure. I would say, simplistically, certainly prior to COVID, there were more or less the same. There is certainly more of an interest to go a little bit shorter term. So three years and by the way, we're okay with that because I'd rather negotiate two or three years from now than right now. So the lease in 2020, the new stuff that we did in 2020 and some of those renewals, some of the renewals we're doing 20 21 are shorter two, three years. But I think actually that could be in our best interest too because obviously, we've had being shut down and restricted and all this other stuff. We don't have quite the ability to point to sales as a way to increase rent. So I think we\u2019re - and I think it's actually a two-way street. It's working out fine with the vast majority of our retailers. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks for taking my question. David and Brian, maybe, if you could talk a little bit about your debt philosophy, in particular, your mortgage profile - your mortgage maturity profile significantly shorter than your unsecured debt maturity profile. And presumably some of that is due to the fact that mortgage debt these days is less readily available. Maybe if you can talk about some of your upcoming mortgage debt that's coming - as in the fashion center, Pentagon, the Fashion Valley in San Diego, Florida Mall, some of these big JVs, how are your partners talking about the funding of those mortgages and/or the re-upping of the mortgages there? How are the banks doing that? And also I think you've qualified that or you've indicated you've got about $714 million of mortgage debt that's probably in fact we know some of this is already in the news is being handed back. Those are not obviously those premium centers. But talk about - if you can walk us through some of the - your thinking regarding your mortgage debt and do you think you'll have less or more mortgage debt after this year? David Simon : I'd say pretty similar are the couple like the Florida Mall Fashion Valley, pretty straightforward doing it. In some cases, it's got 10-year deals and maybe a little shorter. We did what 15 secure refinancing even in this period of time. So I don't find it overly complicated or overly concerning or any risk that there's not the ability, any risk that there's not the ability to refinance stuff. On nonrecourse, there's certain debt that's nonrecourse that may be in professional servicing. That's kind of a contractual right for the borrower which is a standalone entity that\u2019s nonrecourse to SPG. It\u2019s also the right from the special servicer right. So we\u2019ve done - we\u2019ve dealt with those for a number of years. In some cases, they\u2019ll be restructured, mutually agreed to; and if not, and the special servicer would like to own the real estate, we're more than happy to cooperate and do it in a professional manner. We did one just recently, and it's absolutely in the best interest of Simon Property Group shareholders those decisions that we're making on that front. So very straightforward, very professional, honoring the contracts, rights on both sides. Make - hope to make deals in some; if not, then they'll no longer be part of our portfolio, and we wish that new owner the best of luck. Floris van Dijkum : Great. Brian McDade : Maybe a quick one from me, on the duration here. Obviously, our unsecured portfolio benefits from the ability to issue 30-year debt. So that's going to naturally drive the duration higher on a weighted basis. Floris van Dijkum : The other question I guess I have, one of the unknowns from the market is what are the right cap rates for malls in particular? What are the right cap rates for A malls? I mean, I think the market sort of has gone down on the fact that C malls are worth very little and the size is very high cap rates in low values. But the question is more regarding your portfolio. And you've mentioned your low FFO multiple. We've seen you know the Brookfield transaction at a much, much lower cap rate than where you're trading at. As you look at and we also know that there\u2019s a large portfolio owned by West or the Westfield portfolio owned by unified potentially that that could be in play as well. How should the market think about cap rates for malls and maybe give your view on that? David Simon : This is a known unknown, right, as opposed to an unknown, unknown, right. Floris van Dijkum : Yes, of course. David Simon : I would simply say there's - the cap rate is what we want it to be because I think we're the only buyer out there. So, and I'll look in the mirror and I'll decide what the right cap rates are. I think Brookfield is busy buying out, [indiscernible] busy buying up EPY. And I think we're the only buyer as far as I know. Everybody as herd mentality one way or another, we are buyers of high quality real estate. And the funny thing is, when we decide to buy something that doesn't count as to what cap rate it should be, now we're the only buyer. So, go figure that out. I don't know if that's a known unknown or a, you know, whatever. But the fact of the matter is we're really the only - I mean we're really the only buyer. And yet, everybody wants to point to a cap rate that we're not the buyer. But I don't - I never understood why we're not good enough to be the arbiter of what cap rates should be. But I'll let you figure that out for us. I can't figure that out. Floris van Dijkum : But also presumably, as we've seen a lot in the tech businesses, when you buy something, obviously then that reinforces what the right, so you actually can determine what the right cap rate for your own value can be based on the value you're willing to pay for somebody else? David Simon : Well, listen, we did close just a recent transaction and in that - that's a pretty good indication. Floris van Dijkum : Of the transaction? David Simon : That's correct. That's correct. So\u2026 Floris van Dijkum : Right. David Simon : \u2026and any of that. But I want you, Floris, I want you to get back to me and explain why we can't be the arbiter of cap rates. Why it has to be a state pension fund, why it can't be Simon Property Group? I don't get it, okay. Anyway, I'm kidding, but not really. But I'm kidding, mostly. Floris van Dijkum : So you think if I were - sorry, I guess I'm slightly going over. David Simon : Yes. You\u2019re over your allotted time. Call anytime. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Just a quick one. You mentioned boxes were skewing the 2020 releasing spreads. Could you tell us if they would have been positive if you strip those out and just give us any color on 2021 activity as well? David Simon : Tom Ward is shaking his head. Yes, and for those of you who know Tom Ward, you can count on it. They would have been positive, yes. Mike Mueller : Got it. And any color on 2021 expirations? David Simon : In terms of renewals or appraisal or\u2026 Mike Mueller : Yes, exactly. Yes, all of the above, yes. David Simon : In terms of what percent were done yet or not? Mike Mueller : Percentage done, if the trends are consistent. Is there still renewing at positive rates as well? David Simon : Well, I don't - I mean, that's factored in. I don't know what - I don't know - I can't really answer off the top of my head on spreads. But what - we have a percent done. Does anybody know off the top of their head? Brian McDade : Like I say, we\u2019re 50% done. David Simon : Yes, over 50%, but we can get you more. I've seen it, but I'm sorry to tell you I just don't remember. Mike Mueller : No, that\u2019s fine. David Simon : Tom could give that to you, the percent done. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : I just want to clarify, in terms of the 4% to 5% portfolio growth, this is overall NOI, right, not same-store? Brian McDade : Correct. We are - given the - I don't know how they show comp anymore given that we were shut down with restrictions. So I made the decision that we're just going to show you portfolio NOI, all-in, because you could argue that none of it is comp because, I mean, how do you - or all of it is comp. I don't really know what to do. So the simple thing is we're just going to show you our portfolio NOI without the comp distinction. So it\u2019s all the real estate, all of the NOI, and hopefully that'll be helpful to you. Linda Tsai : Thanks. It looks like U.S. gross contractual rents went down 2% to 3% each quarter from 2Q to 4Q. What accounted for this fluctuation? Brian McDade : Which, Linda? Linda Tsai : I'm just looking at like when you take the 3Q sup and you look at the reconciliation page with - and like the first line is U.S. gross contractual rents, it's the same that on the 4Q supp. Brian McDade : Yes. It would have gone down to the bankruptcies, yeah, for sure. Linda Tsai : Okay. So the $165 million versus $159.91 million versus\u2026 Brian McDade : Yes. I don\u2019t\u2026 Linda Tsai : Okay. Brian McDade : I mean - why don\u2019t you talk to Tom, I'll give you the more detail but instinctually, I would just say you - it had to go down because of bankruptcies, I mean\u2013 but he can fill that in. Linda Tsai : But sorry, one last one. You mentioned that the ABG brands generated $3.5 billion in digital sales\u2026 Brian McDade : Not ABG. Not ABG, all of our retail brands, okay? Linda Tsai : Okay. Brian McDade : So our investment in Penney, Aero, [indiscernible] Brooks Brothers, Forever 21, put it all and $3.5 billion. Linda Tsai : Okay. And any sense of what this growth rate looks like going forward? Brian McDade : Well, I mean, I'm kind of torn because it's been pretty quick with COVID, right. Our stores aren\u2019t open but we're shut down for a long time. But it's growing reasonably well. Linda Tsai : Okay. Brian McDade : But we have - I think the important thing here is we have embedded in our company an e-commerce company, okay? Now, again I know it's - we've got a complicated structure. We don't own 100% of everything, but we are in at a pretty reasonable scale. We have an e-commerce company that does $3.5 million of digital sales. That\u2019s the most important point. Now it\u2019s up to us and the management team to how to put it all together so the market recognizes the value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Vince Tibone : I just had a follow-up to Linda's question on the comp NOI piece. I just want to make sure I understand the guidance you stated correctly. So the 5% increase in portfolio NOI for next year, is that number inclusive of incremental NOI from Taubman? Because based on my math that would make most or all of that 5% increase that you do with Taubman and the legacy Simon assets with either flat or slightly down? Is that fair in clarifying that? David Simon : Vince, you\u2019re trying to paint a negative picture my friend. That's just no metric. That's just Simon's portfolio, it doesn't include the Taubman. Vince Tibone : Does that work out\u2026 David Simon : \u2026for the guidance piece. Brian McDade : For the guidance piece. Correct. Vince Tibone : No, that I want to make sure I clarify that. Brian McDade : Yes. I accept that. It's a fair question. It's just our existing portfolio does not have anything to do with TRG. Vince Tibone : And then in the fourth quarter, is it fair to say the domestic portfolio NOI is pretty close to the old comp NOI definition then? Brian McDade : It's always been, yes. I mean, it\u2019s always been - as you know, our comp NOI is - has been 95% - been frankly 90% - 90%, 95% of the portfolio. So we sat here and I looked at and I go why do we put comp NOI? What do we take out? What do we don\u2019t take out? It's just - it's more - there's just no need for it, especially given what we endured in 2020. We'll just give you the number, portfolio whether it has a redevelopment that's taking the NOI down or we added something to take it - the NOI up, it\u2019s almost irrelevant, it's all on the margin. And again, I know that - I'm glad you clarified that, that does not include TRG and we'll figure out exactly how to portray it for 2021. Vince Tibone : Okay. I\u2019ll go with my next question, is going forward, I mean, it totally makes sense from the redevelopment piece just to lump it together but I think next year with Taubman getting added, it would be helpful to have some sense of ongoing operations versus the incremental NOI from Taubman at this point? Brian McDade : Yes. I think that's a fair statement. So we'll - we will figure out if we lost it, we'll make sure that we highlight what the number is. Vince Tibone : And then maybe just one more quick one for me. Just can you provide a little additional color on the leasing spreads, specifically maybe comparing or providing a little commentary on malls versus outlets today? David Simon : That's a good one. I don't know, do you know off the top of your head? Brian McDade : So there's - malls was - obviously we recorded number of minus 6.8%. I talked about the fact that mix, you think about some of those acres that were in the mix previously, now were driving the mall spread negative, but the preliminary point is positive. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: So I guess a question for you on the outlook for retail sales more broadly. We\u2019ve talked to some people who express concern that as COVID subsides, that retail sales from malls and outlets specifically could be negatively impacted because there will be an outsized demand for travel, entertainment, and social gatherings, and that's where consumers will be spending their dollars. And additionally, because of COVID, there's been a lack of new fashion trends outside of leisure, sweats for us to wear comfortably at home, which could make apparel sales challenging for a while. And then there is the concern of the further e-commerce share again. So I guess I'm curious how you're thinking about the near-term opportunity and risk for retail sales here, how that plays into your expectations for rent, and also the projects you're starting and how you're populating those redevelopment projects. Thank you. David Simon : Yes. Listen, I can't sit here and make a prediction other than what I said earlier. So I think suburbia is going to be - really make a major comeback. It was all about street retail. It was all about urbanization. I think you're going to see a movement towards suburbs, and that'll be - that\u2019ll spell good opportunity for us. And I'm not overly concerned about people are going to have their disposable income and go here and there. I think we'll get our fair share of the growth that's expected when we get past COVID and resume our normal lives. Not overly worried about it. Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Just following up on spread, I know you\u2019ve been asked this question several different ways, but I\u2019m curious overall. Is there anything here in the recent leases you're signing or aren't you seeing the numbers that suggest that spreads could cross here in 2021? I'm curious what your assessment of the prospect of your\u2026 David Simon : Well, look, I think, I mean, again I think we are - if I could put a lot of these recent questions in perspective, I mean, in evaluating what we think we're going to earn next year is there's science but there's an element of art because we are dealing with a very uncertain macroenvironment predominantly because of COVID and the impacts that it has on the psyche and how much stimulus we're going to have. There's a lot of uncertainties there, so we try to do the best we can to kind of give you a portrait of what we're going to earn. And there's a lot that goes into it. I think it's hopefully we'll be in that range and we\u2019ll execute like we have historically and we'll be in that range. But it's really hard to pinpoint a specific statistic one way or another because there's just so many variables out there and we try to put it all together in this range to give you a sense of what we think the earnings will be next year or this year, I should say. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Just talk about your development pipeline, the yield of 8%, I don\u2019t think that's changed over the past couple quarters. I'm just curious is that because the projects are pretty much leased and ready to go so there's not much risk to that yield? And secondly, if you had to put new dollars to work, is 8% on development or redevelopment enough to justify it? Brian McDade : Well, the answer is it hasn't changed much because the development - I mean, not much has changed. I mean, it's been in lockdown as you know, in dealing with COVID. So we hope to look at where we can accretively add, and the answer is no. 8%, there is - no guide it\u2019s got to be over 8% or 9%. It\u2019s got to be what's the value of the property, what it's going to do to the property. I mean, if the property is an 8% cap rate property. And you get an 8% return, you're essentially treading water unless you think you're going to suddenly make it a 6% property which is possible in certain redevelopments. On the other hand, if you spend an 8% on a 5%, then you\u2019ve made a lot of money. So it - everything boils down to the specific real estate that we're trying to create over a long-term basis. Now remember, we give you these numbers kind of more or less out of the box. But if you get 8% with growth, I mean, that's a pretty good return, unlevered return going forward. So again, it depends on the real estate. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just last question from me, how do you think about - any early thoughts on the kitchen dollar minimum wage and how do you think your retails can handle it and at the end of the day like how much exposure you might be - you might have at Simon as a company? David Simon : Yes, I really don't, you know. I'm going to stay out of politics. And we'll - I mean I think we all were frustrated with the - what was trust upon us last year because of the - the way that we got treated versus other boxes and other warehouses. The mall seemed to get the brunt of a lot of the restrictions. We would seem more symbolic than inside. Now the reality is, all I want is a level playing field. Just level it for everybody and we'll figure out how to operate in that environment. And I would just say, if it's level and make sense, then great. Then - I could look at that from two, three, four different vantage points and as long as it's a level playing field. Then that's all of it that I'm focused on - and beyond that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : David I just had - just two other questions. If you talk about sort of the retailers now that you own and obviously with the amount of closures and the malls had obviously their e-commerce sales were rising pretty significantly. You and I have talked over the years about how so much of a retailer's brand was driven by the physical footprint and how you as a landlord, weren't sharing in those e-commerce sales? Especially when your assets were serving as the reason why some of those people may go online and you had expressed a lot of frustration about not getting your fair share of that. I guess now that you're sitting on both sides, can you comment a little bit about how you may be restructuring your leases with those retailers to be able to A) share in those e-commerce sales and what you're doing to benefit from that? David Simon : Well, there's no real - I mean it's - there's no real change. I mean, we discuss with a lot of retailers what happens if they buy online return to store. What happens if it shifts from store? What happens if they pick up and reserve it in store? And those are all - we have a pretty consistent approach to it. Even with the pandemic and all the - all of the pressures that we've had to deal with and where it still more or less sticking to what we think is the right approach on that front. So I mean, I\u2019ll never - we're not looking to get our fair share of their e-commerce sales. So I think you mischaracterized it. I think we're just looking to not get hurt when they do sales. But somehow the store is involved in that sale and that\u2019s all that we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re not - as they do all their business online God bless them, but if the store interaction is important to them we don\u2019t want our sales to be reduced. Because the store is providing a service and they\u2019re in lies in a discussion and it really said that\u2019s ongoing and it\u2019s - and I think we\u2019re making a lot of progress on that front. Michael Bilerman : Right, if now owning more of the brands, owning more retailers as you sort of get involved and figuring out what is the right split and how would all be handled. And I understand the credit aspect those - where those sales and how it happened whether its returns, but I would imagine that obviously your assets serves a good marketing for those brands? And in calculating what rent you want that retailer to pay based on the sales that they generate within that trade area is something that you would want for Simon shareholders. As I'm trying to figure out how you balance the two sides today? David Simon : We've been balancing things for years and years and years that\u2019s what we do. Look I would say for most retailers having the store is extremely important because if they're in a market out of sight, out of mind they're certainly retailers that are going to experiment with shrinking their store print - store footprint dramatically and assuming that they're going to pick up online. Maybe they - maybe it works I think it won't, but we'll see. Some will take their chance and they certainly have that right to do whatever they want as leases expire. But I don't think they'll make it up on the Internet. And the most and the best successful retailers are ones that really figure out how to do both really well and that's the ones that we want to do business with. And our brands we want to be in that category and in some cases we're not quite there. I mean I would tell you that Penney\u2019s e-commerce business is not where it needs to be. On the same thing their store business isn't either. But we're going to mutually go after both elements. I would tell you that the Aero store business is terrific and they're picking up their e-commerce business. I would tell you that Forever 21 doesn't quite have a fully developed e-commerce business. And we want that to happen because we think that makes the store business better. Michael Bilerman : Right. David Simon : Not that complicated. There'll be some folks that are in our industry that will say I've got 300 stores. I've got 400 stores, I can do it a 100 and all the growth will come online. My personal view is I don't think they'll succeed. It's really hard to shrink to grow. That really - that's a really hard thing to do. Now, maybe you have to shrink to survive. But shrink to grow would be a better company that's a tough one. It's few and far between but maybe some can make it work. And if they do God bless. And if they do then they\u2019ll probably want stores to grow again so that we\u2019ll be back at it and we\u2019ll see. Michael Bilerman : That\u2019s helpful. David Simon : But I mean I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve answered your question. But there\u2019s really - in our frustration is we just want the recognition that - we certainly don\u2019t want to get penalized if the store is a critical component for that transaction to have taken place. Michael Bilerman : Great, thanks for the color, David. David Simon : Sure. Okay, we\u2019ve lost - me and the whole team and our time. So thank you. Happy New Year even though you're not supposed to do it in February and we'll talk soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good evening. I'm pleased to report that our business has significantly improved after having addressed the impacts from COVID-19, including the restrictive governmental orders that have forced us to shut down, as well as reduce our operating capacity. Thankfully, those restrictions are now being lifted. I'm pleased to report our continued improvement in our profitability and cash flow generated for the first quarter. First quarter funds from operation was $934 million or $2.48 per share. FFO increased approximately $150 million or $0.31 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Our international operations continued to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions. And in fact, the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $0.08 per share compared to our expectations given the closures that have occurred internationally. We also recorded additional COVID impacts in the first quarter of approximately $0.07 per share from based upon basically domestic rent abatements and uncollectible rents. We generated $875 million in cash from operations in the quarter, which was an increase of 18% compared to the prior-year period. We collected over 95% of our net billed rents for the first quarter and our in-line tenant collections are back to pre-COVID levels in the approximate 98% range. Our operating metrics in the period were as follows : mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 90.8%, down 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This 50 basis point decline for the quarter is approximately 75% - 75 basis points less than the average historical seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Average base rents was $56.07, up 60 basis points year over year. Leasing spreads declined for the trailing 12 months, primarily due to the mix of deals that have fallen out, the spread calculation that have resulted in an increase to the average closing rate by approximately $8 per square foot for the trailing 12 months. Pricing continues to improve with the average opening rate per square foot for the trailing 12 months of approximately $60 per foot. And as you can see in the lease expiration schedule included in our supplemental, our expiring rents for the next few years are less than $60 per square foot. Keep in mind that the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for variable lease income based on sales. In certain circumstances in addressing tenant COVID negotiations last year, we, in certain cases, agreed to lower our initial base rent in exchange for lower unnatural sales breakpoints, allowing us to participate in the improved sales performance as the economy recovers. Now we think that will end up being a very smart move on our behalf. Those deals are included in the average opening rate at the lower base minimum rent and does not include our estimation of what the percentage rent could be, and we'll, obviously, believe those contributions in time will add to our cash flow. Leasing momentum has continued across our portfolio. We signed 1,100 leases for approximately 4.4 million square feet, and we have significant number of leases in our pipeline, our leasing volume in both number of leases in square feet was greater than the volume in each of the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. The improving domestic economic environment, shopper sentiment, have increased shopper foot traffic and sales across our portfolio. As I mentioned, increased in traffic for our open air and suburban centers has been very encouraging and retail sales continue to improve across the portfolio with higher sales volumes in March compared to 2019 levels. We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, our second outlet in the United Kingdom in early April. This was behind schedule, was supposed to open in the fall of 2020 but was delayed due to COVID restrictions. We're pleased that this has now been lifted and we're now able to open and serve the shoppers. During the first quarter, we started construction of our fifth premium outlet in South Korea. We're excited about that opportunity. And hopefully by now, with respect to our brand and retailer investments, you've seen that we've been able to add significant value there. Our global brands within SPARC outperformed their plans in March and April on both sales and gross margin, led by Forever 21 and A\u00e9ropostale. For the two months combined, SPARC outperformed the sales plan by more than $135 million and our gross margin plan by more than $75 million. And we're also very pleased with the JCPenney early results. They continue to be above our plan. Our company's liquidity position at Penney is strong at $1.2 billion, and balance sheet is in very good shape with leverage of less than 1.2 times net debt to projected EBITDA. We continue to add new brands to the JCPenney portfolio, and we expect growth to be our focus going forward. Just a quick update on Taubman, we're very pleased with our partnership and the results in the first quarter. Our teams have collectively shared and implemented many best practices and are adding value to the assets. We expect to step up redevelopment plans with mixed-use opportunities throughout their TRG portfolio. Capital markets, very similar to what we always do. We're very active. We completed $1.5 billion senior note offering at 1.96%, weighted average term of 8.4 years. We also completed a EUR 750 million note, shouldn't say dollar, at one and one-eighths percent coupon at a term of 12 years. We used those proceeds to completely repay the $2 billion unsecured term facility associated with the Taubman deal, as well as pay off our $550 million senior notes. We've also refinanced six mortgages for $1.3 billion, our share of which is $589 million at an average interest rate of 3.36%. That market is continuing to improve. And at the end of the quarter, with all this activity, we have $8.4 billion of liquidity, consisting of $6.9 billion available on our credit facility; $1.5 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash. And reminder, that is net of $500 million of U.S. commercial paper outstanding at quarter end. We paid $1.30 per share in cash, in terms of our dividend on April 23. And then, finally, as you've seen, given our first-quarter results, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance from $9.50 to $9.75 per share to $9.70 to $9.80 per. This is an increase of $0.20 per share at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top end of the range or a 13% - or a $0.13 increase at midpoint and that represents a 6.5% to 7.6% growth rate compared to our 2020 results. So in conclusion, pleased with the results, encouraged with what we're seeing in terms of sales, traffic, retail demand. And we continue to continue to increase our performance and our Profitability. Ready for questions. Operator : Our first question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Rich Hill : Hey, David, good afternoon. I had a quick question on the guide. Look, we've argued that the guide looks pretty conservative because I think if you assume no NOI growth versus 2020, you can sort of get to the high end of the prior range. And so the revision looks fairly conservative to us. I recognize there was some lease termination benefits in this quarter. So maybe you can just walk us through how you think about the cadence of that guide in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q? David Simon : Well, Rich, you can't blame us for being conservative, can you? Rich Hill : No sir. David Simon : After what we dealt with for 14 months, we did not - just a couple of things. We - the lease settlement income was kind of in our plan, one. On the other hand, we did not - when we gave our initial guidance, we did not expect the negative results that we saw in Europe, primarily of $0.08. So that hurt us by $0.08. And that's still going to underperform given the restrictions for the rest of the year because that lockdown amazingly took a lot longer and lasted a lot longer. So unfortunately, in Europe, they're still dealing with COVID. That will have an impact. And then, I would say we - as you know, in the first quarter, we did still have some abatement and some bad debt, so to speak, that also affected us of $0.07. So we still think we are - there may be some further activity in that. We don't know. It's pretty much behind us at this point. But we're conservative. We've got Europe. I think the comp NOI, we didn't give you a number, but we expect in the U.S. to do better than what we initially thought. And I hope you're right. I hope we're conservative and I hope we do better than what we've what we're guiding to, but it's just been a traumatic time for this company and our folks, and you can't blame us. Rich Hill : Understood. I have one follow-up question. And hopefully, I'm not putting words in your mouth, but I think on the last earnings call, you had talked about total core portfolio, ex-Taubman, being in the 3% to 4% range for 2021. And I note that total portfolio was plus 4% in this quarter, including Taubman, if I read it correctly. So how should we think about the total portfolio growth going forward, recognizing you haven't guided? Is that 3% to 4% still accurate, meaning that there should be a pretty significant ramp over the next several quarters? David Simon : Well, let's separate the two. I think when we talked about our comp, we thought we were going to be in the four-ish range, just comp, excluding Taubman. So to be clear, at least that's what our - my intent was when we had our year-end call. We expect to be a little bit above that. I mean, we still don't know. As I mentioned to you, because of COVID and some of the negotiations with retailers, we're betting a little bit more, so to speak, on the com because of the sales aspect of it. But we would hope to be around 5% on that as we look at it. And then, Taubman, we are just putting that in based on our plan. They're off to a pretty good start, and that's where you get the portfolio numbers. So the comp NOI should be in the 4% to 5%, hopefully, on the high end of that range. And then we itemized Taubman because we didn't want to confuse people. We're just going to show you those results. Then next year, 2022, we'll just have the TRG portfolio on our comps. So you'll see Taubman the rest of the year the way it's outlined. Did that help you at all? Rich Hill : It does. I can follow up with Brian and Tom off-line on some wonky accounting questions, but that's helpful color. I'll get back in the queue. David Simon : I pride myself in being a wonk. So if you're ever bored, you can call me anytime. Rich Hill : All right, sir. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : So thanks. Good afternoon, David. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more on kind of the leasing momentum and you talked about the 4.4 million feet done in Q1. Maybe just give us a little bit more color kind of what the pipeline sort of looks like, what types of attendance are you seeing. Is there a focus, whether it be food, whether it be on apparel, whether it be on entertainment? Just what are you seeing on the leasing today? David Simon : Well, keep my fingers crossed, but we're actually seeing really good demand across the board. Very interestingly, the restaurants demand is at the very high level. We're seeing a lot of restaurateurs that for some of the fixed space that was vacated They want to come in, retrofit it, get open quicker. So we're seeing really good demand there. I think some of the strong retailers are growing their business significantly. American Eagle is a great example. Urban Outfitters is a great - another great example of two companies that just pop to mind that have We have multiple deals in the works on. We're probably 80% done, Steve, on our renewals thus far. And I'd say we generally feel pretty good and much better than we felt in a long time. And I just think the - we're seeing a resurgence in brand. So let's take a great example of a company, Crocs. Crocs was hot a decade ago. People thought it lost its mojo, maybe it had. It's now killing it. So we are seeing footwear, we're seeing apparel. We're seeing another - a lot of brands in the - that are new, that are coming into the - that want great retail real estate. So I'm seeing basically a resurgence across the board, and our team is very, very active. We're also seeing demand from entrepreneurs, local, regional. So pretty good results are coming that I think you'll start to see in the upcoming quarters. Steve Sakwa : OK, thanks. And I guess, that sort of dovetails into sort of my follow-up, when you think about kind of the occupancy trend, and I appreciate your comments that the drop sequentially was maybe less than what you normally see seasonally. But do you feel like occupancy at this point is now at the bottom and you start to see that kind of improve throughout this year or into next year? And then same with kind of leasing spreads, does this kind of mark the bottom here on leasing spreads? David Simon : Well, again, I think we gave a rather lengthy explanation on leasing spreads. The thing I would focus on, it is mix driven. So that's the first point. The other thing is, as part of COVID, we were doing renewals, where we had lower base rents and more unnatural breakpoints, which I think hopefully, based on sales trends are going to actually - we're going to actually have made a pretty good bet on that. So I don't think you'll see that as the mix changes, and gets more stable, and that's why we pointed out the kind of - what you see expiring. I would hope for that you'd see that essentially that decrease go away with time as that goes out. So that's the first point. And then, I think, occupancy, I would think we would see improvement clearly where we were at the end of last year by the time we get back up to year-end. So I would expect a reasonable improvement on '20 versus '21. We're not going to get back to 2019 levels in '21. We look kind of more in '22, '23 level, but that's a little bit of a estimate. But the demand, frankly, I don't want to oversell it. That's not my style. But I mean, I'm - we've got - and I don't like naming names, but even though I named two already, we are just making deals with - across the board with a bunch of people. We do have some - still have some difficult relationships and negotiations that we're dealing with. And again, I won't name names, but - so to the extent it's not - the occupancy uptick is not as robust as you think, it's primarily because we've taken the tactical response that, look, we're not going to - if they're not paying what we think is fair, we'd just rather sit on empty space. And that's a judgment that I hope investors will appreciate that having done this for quite some time, we're not always going to get it right, but the fact of the matter is we're going to try and do fair deals. But to the extent that it's too one-sided, we're just - we'll sit on the space. So we still have a few of those kind of scenarios that will probably play out in '21. Steve Sakwa : Great. That's it for me. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Caitlin Burrows : Hi there. Maybe just following up on the occupancy point. The lease termination fees were significant in the quarter. And I think you mentioned that was kind of your plan. What made you comfortable allowing this tenant or multiple tenants move out early and Simon take that termination income rather than keeping them in occupancy? David Simon : Yeah, that's really in our - it's a good, really good question. It's really an art versus science. It's really a function. We don't really like to do it. But in some cases, we think the space is really good, and we'll be able to ring the bell on the lease termination income and then lease it up. And so we get the benefit of both. If I get the present value of that lease stream more or less, and then I have the space to lease, that's a pretty good business for us to do. And that's the case, that's what we saw in Q1. So we basically, in a lot of cases, took the net present - near 100% of the net present value of that lease, got the money, got the cash, then we have the space and then we'll lease it up. That's pretty good case, and that's pretty smart to do, pretty thoughtful to do. Our space isn't going anywhere. Our malls aren't going anywhere. There's still great real estate, demand is picking up. So in some cases, we'll - that's the kind of trade we'll make. We're not taking real discounts to NPV. And obviously, we are very sophisticated in running the math to see what the fair deal is. Caitlin Burrows : OK. And then, maybe on the acquisition front, Simon raised equity later in 2020, and I think some of it was earmarked for possible property acquisitions. So just wondering what you're seeing in terms of opportunity, and I guess, willing sellers, and is there any commentary on whether you're more interested in potential U.S. or international properties. David Simon : Well, I think we have built a great portfolio over a long period of time. We don't need anything to continue to run profitably and grow our earnings now after having dealt with 14, 15 months of COVID. On the other hand, if there's some - a few properties here and there that make strategic sense, we're willing able buyers of that. The sellers, they ebb and they flow, and sometimes their expectations aren't where we think they should be. Obviously, we're very active with Taubman. We think that's going to turn out to be a very good deal for everybody involved. So it's not like we haven't just done a significant transaction. And we think there's lots of upside in the portfolios we work with the Taubmans to recover from COVID. So we're - we've got our eye out. We're - we've got a great network. We can always enhance it, but we also are looking at content. And where - what do I mean by content? Well, you'll see - as we point out to the value creation in some of our content deals over this year or next, you'll see our ability to create significant value off balance sheet that I think helps us with content and what we are trying to do in terms of positioning our real estate for the future. Caitlin Burrows : OK, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good afternoon, David. How are you? David Simon : Good. Alexander Goldfarb : Oh, fabulous, fabulous. David Simon : It's earnings. We got a bunch of stuff still going on. Alexander Goldfarb : Life is good. So two questions here. Saw the Eddie Bauer news, and if my ability to read English is correct, it looks like you did that in the traditional ABG investment wrapper not in the SPAC. So a two-parter for my first question, just - I know last time on the call, you said the SPAC will do a lot more than just traditional retail, but maybe just walk through thoughts on how stuff goes into - just remind us how stuff goes into the ABG wrapper versus the SPAC. And then, two, the disclosure on Page 16, which you guys have had for a while, but it does show the benefit from these retail investments starting to come through, which really shows that, hey, these things are making money. But to that point, just sort of curious how much of the brand's NOI is coming from Simon centers versus coming from non-Simon centers? David Simon : Well, we don't really go through that. But no, these are retailers that have essentially a very broad portfolio. And so they get a lot of their profitability from stores and e-commerce outside of our portfolio. So just to touch on your last one. So just a quick note on Eddie Bauer. So Eddie Bauer, we will partner with ABG to buy the IP, which we think is terrific. It's been around 100 years, celebrated 100-year anniversary, I think, last year. It was the first company to create the down jacket. And in 2019, it did $786 million of sales, and we are buying the IP at a fraction, a lot less than one times. And if you look at where brands are being priced, you will have noticed that we did - we'll do a great deal. In addition, we are buying - SPARC will buy the operating company which were partners with ABG on for essentially the working capital, and they'll operate the stores. And we think - again, they're going to add $30 million to $40 million of EBITDA to SPARC. SPARC this year projected we'll do about $130 million of EBITDA. That doesn't really come through because we have depreciation. We don't add that back for FFO and the like. But - and so SPARC is doing fantastic. Eddie Bauer, adding that to SPARC will be really beneficial, and then we're beginning to create kind of a whole outdoor apparel with the brands that we have with Nautica and so on. And then I think the IP of Eddie Bauer will be - will have growth associated with it under the ABG umbrella. Alexander Goldfarb : But as far as like your thoughts of this going into theirs, like so is the SPAC really just for more like technology or efficiency cost investments, not retail? David Simon : Well, this is not in the SPAC. The SPAC is available to do kind of what we told the market, things outside. But this is like a core ABG, SPARC transaction that the synergies associated with folding this into SPARC doing the - following the same game plan that we've done with all the other brands we bought is essentially a no-brainer. Alexander Goldfarb : OK. Second question is, David, ESG, certainly a growing investment outlook and a lot of funds looking for it, but there's more talk in retail about the efficiencies of physical versus online. Clearly, individual boxes being shipped, intuitively doesn't make sense. Driving trucks, whether gas or electric through neighborhoods doesn't sort of compete versus bulk shipment to the malls and shopping centers. So what are you guys doing to address this, not just on the white paper you did a few years ago, but more collectively, whether individually or industry, to really highlight and showcase the environmental benefits of physical retail to the investment community and to the local communities as a whole versus just what the industry has done before, which as I say, you've done the white paper, etc.? David Simon : Well, Alex, this reminds me of the - it's - if you can sense hesitation, it's because you can sense frustration. Physical shopping, unquestionably, is better for the environment than e-commerce. And we have written studies on it. We have discussed it and right now, nobody cares. It's our job to have the communities care. And I think part of why people cared less was, obviously, because of COVID and priorities were focused elsewhere. But I think it's a real focus for us in the future to explain the merits of our physical footprint and what it means for carbon footprint of physical stores vis-a-vis e-commerce, not to mention all of the energy costs, server costs, etc., packaging. You can go on and on and on about the cost associated, the carbon footprint of e-commerce compared to physical. And I will refute anyone, and I think others have tried to say that e-commerce is - has less carbon footprint. It - that just is not true. So - but we have our job to do much - reminds me, we got to get the governments to care. We got to get governments to ask. And it reminds me that I've been around enough to know that e-commerce, Internet sales, taxation, we talk, we talk, we talk. Everybody says, you're right, you're right, you're right. Nobody did anything until thankfully, the Supreme Court overturned the Quill decision to level the playing field. There is no reason, in addition to that that retail real estate should be taxed 10 times what warehouse and distribution facilities are taxed, 10 times. But hopefully, when we give our pitch to local jurisdictions, real estate assessors, government authorities and so on, they will care. We do. And - but we - I'm open to ideas on how to get the message out. The message is clear to me. Hopefully, people will care. Alexander Goldfarb : We do. David Simon : And I'm open to ideas on how to get the message out. Alexander Goldfarb : The message is clear to me. Hopefully people will care. OK, thanks, David. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Great. Good afternoon, David. I wanted to ask you about sort of development and redevelopment spending. You're, obviously, I think, enthusiastic as all of us are about the recovery and everything that's happening. How do you think about increasing the deployment of capital, either into new assets or into existing assets? If you look on Page 25 of the supplemental, I think that $430 million may be the lowest I've seen in years. And I think back - I think over the last decade, David, you put like $8 billion to work in your assets. So how should we think about deployment of capital over the next couple of quarters or at least announcements of investing more capital when you also think about the investments you can make in Taubman's assets, which I think the schedule excludes? David Simon : Yeah, it's absolutely a very valid observation. I mean, with COVID, we shut things down, we've frankly stopped construction of certain projects in midstream. One is because we had to because governmental orders; two is we didn't necessarily see any light at the end of the tunnel when you basically have 230 properties shut down across the country. So the good news is we were able to do it. We did it without incident, we did it justly, fairly, appropriately And now we're starting back up, Michael. We're still going - we are still a little conservative on that front, primarily. We still have concerns about - we just want to make sure we're through the COVID crises that we've all had to deal with. But it is a goal of ours and a focus of ours to crank this up. Now the good news it's there, it's ready. We've rethought some projects. I think I mentioned this last time, a couple of the California projects, we had more retail than we probably will now. And we're evaluating supply and demand when it comes to other mixed-use components of it. The good news is, without question, the silver lining in surviving this very tough time for all of us, has been that it wasn't too long ago, and it's like clocks. It wasn't too long ago where Suburbia was like, forget about it, right? So to me, and I mentioned this, I don't know, two calls ago, suburbia is hot. Suburbia is the place to be. And we just happen to have a lot of great, well-located suburban real estate that we tend to take - will tend to take advantage of. And I don't think this is a short-term scenario. I think this will play out for several years. So we've got some really good stuff. And the redevelopment pipeline will pick up. And I think Our experience and knowledge and execution will clearly help. And the Taubman portfolio is a great suburban real estate more or less. And there will be great opportunities to add to that. We're already working on, as an example, they have a big development in Cherry Creek, which will end up being a major mixed-use opportunity for TRG that we're there to help the partners sort through as it develops. Michael Bilerman : So when we're thinking about this slide at the end of the year, do you think it could easily be at, let's say, a $2 billion run rate when you include Taubman and all the projects that you're accelerating? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much. And also, just given your overall enthusiasm about the results and where you see traffic and sales and leasing, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much that will translate into incremental capital above and beyond what you've already identified? David Simon : Well, again, it's all valid questions. I would say to you by year-end, and this is a guess, and Brian who's looking at me shaking his head, no. But I would - when you look - and we've got a couple of things in Europe that we'll probably do when you put it all together, I would say - again, the spend will be over a year plus we'll end up having a pipeline probably at about $1 billion of stuff that we'll have committed to by year-end. Again, don't hold me to that number, but that would be kind of my gut feel. Brian McDade : Yeah, there will be some that we'll talk to too, Michael. So don't forget about that piece. So there will be projects that get delivered for the year that will ultimately reduce that number. Michael Bilerman : Right, right. And then, just as a follow-up. Clearly, there's a lot of people going out and doing things, and I don't know if it's revenge shopping or stimulus shopping, but there are certainly much more people going out and shopping. How are you able to discern how much of this is just that? Just like we've been stuck around for so long, I just need to get out and do something. I want to go shop versus something that's longer lasting. And are you able to sort of tease out anything from the data analytics in terms of dwell times or conversion rates or any certain retail categories that are seeing more long-lasting benefits than maybe one type of shot in the arm? David Simon : Well, I think that's the big question, right? So that's why we continue to be conservative because between being cooped up, between being locked down, between the stimulus, between celebrating that we are - the country is still around, and we're still going to try to get back to normal, there's clearly some level of euphoria around that. It would be impossible for me to tell you what percent that is. But that's why we were being conservative. On the other hand, we're still seeing pockets of the country that haven't really seen that yet. Who? California is a great example, parts of the New York region. There's still no international tourism, which we would expect to see in '22. So even if it kind of like stabilizes or just kind of normalizes, there'll be other pockets that I think will pick up as the entire country reopens. I mean, let's take California versus Florida. I mean, Disney World has been open nine months. And Disneyland, I think just opened, right? So California has a nine-month lag. And we've got - we're - we've got real presence in California, as you know, that we'll see the benefits of. And then I - and don't underestimate, I do believe, assuming - and this is a global issue, but I do think people are going to start to travel again, globally, probably won't happen much until end of this year or certainly in '22. But we're going to see a pick of that - pickup of that. We might see that in Europe, just because the Chinese has stayed at home. With the Chinese coming here, we could see that here. So there are elements that will pick up the slack to the extent that the last couple of months have been really, really nice to see. Michael Bilerman : OK, thanks for the color, David. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Johnston of DB. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Thank you. Hi, David. So we touched on this a bit, but our store checks are pointing to a pretty high level of online order fulfillment from the mall or the retail store itself. And is this a tenant last mile approach that you're seeing gaining any type of traction? And especially since distribution space has gotten so costly, are retailers talking about this? And could there be a growing trend at work here kind of the merger between online and in-store? David Simon : Well, there's no question that most of the sophisticated retailers really want to be - I don't want to use all the buzzwords, but seamless between online and ship from store, pick up in store, all of that stuff. It's interesting, when we talk to retailers, the majority want to do that. Some like to fulfill it still in the distribution facility. So it's not uniform across the board, but they all want a seamless experience. They want to be able to offer clearly pick-up in-store or deliver from store. In a lot of cases, with shipping and delays that's much more advantageous to them. A handful would prefer to execute out of their distribution facilities. But I'd say the vast majority are moving toward seamless pick-up, ship from store, using that as so to speak, a - ability to fulfill from the physical store is a real advantage to them in terms of delivery costs and so on. So yeah, though there's a few that find it more efficient to do otherwise. So it's like everything else in retail, there's not one size fits all. But it's a good trend. And I think they need their footprint. With the connection for the retailer, lots of retailers will tell you that - not to be repetitive. But as we said and others have said, look, when they close a store and that's their store in their marketplace, they lose the e-commerce business. Or vice versa, when they open a store, their e-commerce business goes up. So they look at it in totality. I think with all the ability now to study the consumer better with all the data, we're able to do a much better job. Derek Johnston : Thank you. That makes sense. Could you expand on some of the early reads from the JCPenney investment? I know you spent some time on Forever 21 and Arrow, and even called out JCPenney briefly. What are you seeing importantly at JCPenney? How have the trends held up there? Are there any remerchandising wins or early successes that you'd like to expand on? David Simon : Well, I think we've been mostly like all of our deals when we buy a retailer out of bankruptcy, we are in the stabilization mode and the capital preservation mode. We've accomplished both of those already. As I mentioned to you, in the call, we've got $1.2 billion of liquidity and undrawn ABL. So we're in good shape. We are bringing new merchandise brands to it. But importantly, some of the other brands that were nervous about us - when I say nervous, not about Simon and ABG, but nervous when you go through a bankruptcy, reestablishing those relationships and giving the vendors comfort that we're going to be around and able to pay for the goods has been really rewarding and we're seeing more and more confidence from the vendor community. So because when you go through bankruptcy, not only landlords get burned, but vendors get burned, and so it's very important for us as new owners taking Penney out of bankruptcy that we give the vendors comfort that we're going to be around to do it. Now the ultimately move toward growth is the future of what we are working on. We're not there yet. We stabilized it. We are bringing in new brands. We've got lots of ideas and what to do there. But the first goal is to rightsize the company, strengthen the financial capabilities, repairing a vendor relationships that we need to do, stabilize the morale and so on. Obviously, that's harder to do in COVID, when people are working remotely. But we've - I've been proud of the execution, and so far, the results. Our plan is above where we thought it was going to be. So that's very encouraging. But in order to turn JCPenney into a 21st century retailer, that's still work in progress. Derek Johnston : Understood. Thanks, David. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I'm just thinking about sales per square foot, if you were to annualize 1Q sales, are you within spitting distance of your pre-COVID sales per square foot? Or is there still a way to go? David Simon : Well, the best - I would say it depends how far you spit Craig, OK? If you play - it depends if you play baseball or not and - what do they call that when they have the - what is that? Brian McDade : Spittoon. David Simon : Spittoon. That's the word I'm looking for. So just to give you a sense of - the best way for us to look at it is March of 2019 to March of '21. I mean, we're way over March of '20. I mean, we are 130% above March of '20. But put that aside because that I would say to you when you put it all together in March of '21 compared to March of 2019, comparable - so same basically stores, we're like a little under - we're like minus 7%, 8%, OK? Now I think April will be ahead of - so when you look at April and March together, I think we're going to be ahead of sales for April, March of 2019, April, March '21, OK? Is that helpful? Craig Schmidt : Yes, that's very helpful. David Simon : And I think that's the way to do it. So yes, I think we're - it's pitting difference. And I think we'll be ahead by - as April sales come rolling in, if you put the two months together, we'll be ahead. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then, I know you were talking earlier about possibly ramping up redevelopment and developments, would you think more would be spent on mixed-use efforts or anchor repositionings? David Simon : I think we'll end up, given the move toward the suburbs and what's happening there and away from CBDs, I actually - I mean, again, this is just a gut feel. So I actually think there'll probably be more toward mixed-use. I really do. Craig Schmidt : OK. And then just finally, are you planning to introduce a lot of your SPARC brands into JCPenney? Like can we see any Bauer department in JCPenney's future? David Simon : I think it's the - it's not just SPARC brands, but it could be ABG brands. Remember, ABG owns a lot of - they have the IP for a lot of different brands. So the answer is, without question, the - it takes time, obviously, design it, manufacture it and get it in there. But I would think in '22, maybe even late '21, we'll start to see a lot of the ABG brands end up in JCPenney. Craig Schmidt : OK, that's it for me. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point. Your line is open. Floris Van Dijkum : Guys, thanks for taking my question. David, maybe - obviously, very encouraging so far. Talking about comp sales of 4% to 5% this year for your historical SPG portfolio. Presumably, Taubman is going to see something similar. Are you working on any initiatives in the TRG portfolio? I'm thinking more of one of the things that sets SPG apart from some of its peers is your focus on specialty leasing, kiosks, things like that. Is that going to be more of an element in the TRG portfolio? Or are they going to be - remain a more traditional high-end retailer? Or do you - where do you see the revenue opportunities in TRG in particular? And could that same-store growth actually be higher as a result of not having some of these things that SPG has had in the past? David Simon : Yeah, I think the short answer is without question. We've actually - they - it wasn't that they were - first of all, you can execute any program we have and still maintain a high-end mall. But put that aside, the - we just this - we just have a lot of - we have a lot of resources to bear. I mean, we've got a big field operation. We're basically in the most - all of their markets. And I think by doing local leasing, specialty leasing, sponsorship at the rate and at the level that we do, we're going to see significant upside in TRG. And in fact, we basically implemented in many cases, the existing SPG sales force for no better word to start selling our product to that portfolio. So that's actually been implemented and we're at work on it. So - and the working relationship to execute that was honestly, great and a lot easier than when I had to deal with Chelsea folks when we came in, OK? So - and I think it's been very - it's been the relationship, the coordination on leasing and development, me and Rick and the Taubmans, doing all of that stuff has been excellent. And yes, the short answer is there is upside, and we've got the - they were limited in resources, frankly, to do it, not out of neglect or out of a different point of view. I just didn't have the people, the scale to do it. Here we go. So we're ready. And we're doing things like insurance that we have more scale to there. So there's all sorts of those things that we are bringing to bear without - with open arms on both sides. So I do think that that portfolio will have a little bit higher uptick with time than probably us because we already do it and they don't. So we'll hope to see some of the benefit of that in the future. Floris Van Dijkum : Great. Thanks. And maybe one follow-up. If you could maybe comment, you're now on both sides of the table, if you will, you're the landlords and you also own these retailers. Does your confidence that you're exuding in this call partly stem from the uptick that you're seeing in the retailers that you've made an investment in? And maybe if you could share some of the growth in maybe sales for those retailers? And you sort of commented a little bit about that, but also the growth in EBITDA that you potentially see going forward for the retailer part of your business? David Simon : Well, I mean, obviously, that data that helps us. So I mentioned in the call for us that literally just two brands in SPARC, Forever 21 and A\u00e9ropostale, are literally $135 million over their plan already. Now their February wasn't as great. Remember, February had a lot of uptick in COVID. But - and so it's sure. I mean, it does - it's a great reference point and it does give us confidence. We're seeing similar good results in Penney. But importantly, our guys across the board talk to all sorts of retailers from luxury to moderate, to department stores. People are feeling pretty good and look at the retail stocks. I mean, the retail stocks have blown past us. I mean, I had Tom do his thing for me. We're still below our COVID - pre-COVID price yet the retailers are, in many cases, 200% higher than what they were. So the answer is, yes, we have a lot of data. We understand the consumer better than ever. But importantly, we have content now that allows us flexibility and knowledge that we didn't necessarily have before. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Hi. In terms of the $0.07 of COVID reserves and abatements, was there any prior-period collections that were positive offset within it that may not repeat? David Simon : Nothing material. We did collect deferred rent of how much, Brian? Brian McDade : Yeah, the deferred, we collected $100 million of previously deferred rents. But that was earnings that we recognized last year, was simply working capital adjustment, Michael. David Simon : Yeah. So that didn't flow through the P&L, but it's always good to see a collection of deferred rent. So but no, not anything noteworthy at all, Mike. Michael Mueller : OK, that was it. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Your line is open. Linda Tsai : Hi. Just looking at your NOI overview disclosure on Page 16, it looks like your share of NOI from retailer investments and also corporate and other NOI sources were down a bit sequentially. What was driving that? Brian McDade : Well, Linda, it's Brian. With respect to the NOI from retailers, you got to remember the seasonality of the retail business, typically, first quarter is the low mark. And so you're actually seeing a positive contribution here relative to historical. Sequentially versus fourth quarter, you would be down because the fourth quarter is, obviously, the biggest point in the year. With respect to corporate and other NOI sources, we do provide the breakdown of that. What you see is the - coming through that line is an increase in lease settlement income. And then offsetting that is some further reductions from our auxiliary lines of business in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of last year. So Simon Business Ventures, those kind of businesses were down relative to a full quarter last year. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And just in terms of the strength in 1Q leasing, can you just talk about who the backfill options are? Are they existing retailers or more new to market? David Simon : I missed the question, what - Brian McDade : The option and leases. David Simon : Well, there's a lot. I mean, it's - there are - I hate naming names, but you've got a lot of the B2C guys that are growing their business. I mentioned to you, American Eagle is growing their business. Urban Outfitters is growing their business So we're - it's really across the board, restaurants, the luxury folks, product, Gucci, Louis Vuitton. I mean, it really is encouraging. You've got - it is really encouraging to see it not in one particular category, but across the board, Levi's, rue21, Ladderock, I mentioned Aerie, Marc Jacobs, Bottega Veneta, Saint Lauren. SPARC is growing some opportunities, and you've got - we had a Golden Goose open, Warby Parker, Craghoppers, a U.K. outerwear brand. I really miss Rick when this happens, OK? So I'm going to have Rick come in for a cameo, OK? I don't do as good a job as Rick, but - when it comes to that. But it is across the board. Linda Tsai : Thanks for that. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste: I guess, that's me. Thank you for taking the question. So question on occupancy. And you talked a bit earlier about rebuilding the occupancy, the time line. But I guess, I was more curious specifically from a cash paying perspective, I think you said you could be back to 2019 occupancy levels by perhaps 2022 or '23. But when do you think we'll see the cash flow impact of that? Is that another year out, so maybe this is more like 2023? David Simon : Well, there's clearly a lag impact, yeah, so I think that's a fair statement. I mean, look, we've run lots of numbers, when do we get past our 2019 numbers, we are certainly not going to get there this year. We're certainly not going to get there next year. Could it be '23, '24? Look, it's so dependent upon the economy and what's out there. But I think the ability to see that closer than what we thought a few months ago is there. So that's the goal. And we're - every day, we're grinding to make that happen. Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Fair enough. Thank you for that. And just a couple of follow-ups on the guide. I understand the restriction that is still ongoing and beyond your control in the international portfolio. But I was curious maybe you could talk a bit about what's implied in the guidance for international this year? You mentioned an $0.08 drag in the first quarter. Is that a level we should expect again in second quarter? And when do you expect that to improve? And also one for Brian, I was curious about the level of bad debt reserves you're carrying at the end of the first-quarter year and perhaps maybe speaking to the broad industry exposure or probability of recovery of some of that and anything implied in the guide? Thank you. David Simon : Well, I'll do Europe. I mean, Europe, we will see further impact in Europe, Q2 against our plan. My guess is probably in the $0.04 to $0.05 range, if I had to guess. And then, I'm hopeful we'll be on plan the rest of Q3 and Q4 as it picks up. Now to the extent that there's anything like the U.S. where there's some pent-up demand, we may see that - may see a little bit of outperformance in Q3 and Q4, but we are not anticipating that. But clearly, we're going to see in the $0.04 or $0.05 range compared to our plan and our guidance. The Europe - and then when I talk about international, it's really Japan, is the squishiest because of COVID and their caution, obviously, with the Olympics coming up. So that could be another couple of cents internationally. Brian McDade : Haendel, with respect to your other question about recoverability of the reserves, I mean, at quarter end, we were appropriately reserved. As you heard us say that we did not get any positive impact in the first quarter from that, and that's our expectation from the balance of the year. The reserves that we're establishing, we expect to be true reserves and write-offs, not a recovery. Haendel St. Juste: OK. And that level again, sorry, what was that at the end of first quarter? Brian McDade : It was consistent with prior years, but we're not giving out individual levels. Haendel St. Juste: OK, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Good evening. So just going to your top tenant list, I noticed some decreases in store counts for - at least for the top five. Just a little bit of an open-ended question here, but just curious if you can provide any color and should we expect some further fallout? David Simon : Well, I mean, look, I think all of the retailers were very conservative in dealing with COVID. And if these leases happen to expire during that awful shutdown and the restrictions and all of that, I mean, they closed stores, so there's going to - and like I said earlier, I mean, there's going to be a few retailers that we are not going to be able to find a happy medium with, and we may lose their entire fleet. And that's - I mean, we're ready for it. And it's - a lot of our expectations are already in those numbers. So we'll see. But yes, I think there'll be - for some of the big retailers, they've announced public store closings. I don't want to get into which that - all of that's out there of the public. But they're all thinning their fleet and the fact of the matter is if they do, they do, and we're used to leasing up space. Ki Bin Kim : OK. And can you just comment about some of the lease clauses and language that's being used today for the new lease deals? And I'm just, in particular, more curious about if tenants have more out. I know you mentioned more percentage rent deals as they hit breakpoints, but I'm just curious if there's some other language with - regarding like future pandemics or things like that that might create some variability. David Simon : Not really. I mean, there's always a lease here or there with 20-plus thousand leases. There's always some variability. But the reality is we - during the COVID renewals, those were difficult discussions. Everybody was under enormous pressure, and in some of those cases, like I said earlier, we reduced our base rent to bet on sales. We'll see maybe we did a better deal than what we thought we had done at that time, OK? Believe me, I prefer to have had the higher base rent. But no one is - there's no - there's very few, very focused on pandemic language, And at this point, there's no material or even meaningful trend in that language. And I would say, generally, lease terms, it depends on the retailer maybe in some cases, they're very similar to what they've been. We're very focused on lease terms. We don't willy nilly just do a deal to do a deal. And there's a lot of give and take. And I would say there's no real super trend that's going on in lease terms. There's always a give and take, but nothing of note that I think we should share at this point. Ki Bin Kim : OK, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Vince Tibone of Green Street. Your line is open. Vince Tibone : Hi, good evening. How sensitive is your NOI this year to tenant sales? It would be helpful if you could provide some guideposts there. For example, just if tenant sales this year came in at 2019 levels, how different would it be if, let's say, tenant sales were 10% higher this year than 2019? David Simon : Well, it is very - it's very complicated. It's very complicated because it's lease by lease, it's where they're natural or unnatural break is, it's when it hits. It's what they tell us, what we audit. And so the simple answer, Vince, as much as I'd like to tell you, we don't really guide to that. We do it in our own budgets. But we're a big company, sophisticated company, lots of ins and outs, And I think that's how we want people to think about us as opposed to what the percent rent is here versus there. It kind of ebbs and flows W.e like people to think about us a little big bit in a more broader context. Vince Tibone : That's - are there like any rough ballpark? Like is it a 20 bps impact if that 10% swing in sales? Or the 2% or 3%? I mean, any kind of rough sense? Because, I mean, tenant sales, obviously, the - you're kind of the one of the big markers we are following, but just trying to get a sense of how much it truly matters for FFO or NOI this year. David Simon : Well, I mean, I'd say simply, if we end up at 2019 sales, we'd be happy. How is that? Even Tom is smiling, OK? Vince Tibone : OK, fair enough. David Simon : Tom does not smile. It takes him a lot to smile. Vince Tibone : One more for me. It looks like temporary tenants continue to take more space in the portfolio. Can you discuss the overall strategy as it relates to backfilling space with these lower rent paying temporary tenants? And just whether you expect the square footage leased to these temp tenants to move higher or lower from here? David Simon : Well, look, we - I mean, frankly, Vince, we have more space. So - because we've lost space. So remember, as you know, we don't add that into our occupancy unless it's a year lease. We also like - again, we like doing business with local and regional entrepreneurs that are bootstrapping their way up to try and build the business. We've had - I mean, our most famous retailer on that is a finish line when they came in - and it's finished lines from Indianapolis. But those guys started with one store, and they grew - obviously, they were just bought by JD Sports. But I mean, we don't know who the next finish line. We did the same thing with LIDS, where they started with one or two stores. So you never know. We like that business. It also creates a uniqueness to the real estate and the local. I was actually just reviewing the book that our specialty leasing folks put together for me every quarter. The mix and the customer care that these people have with their communities is great. The product is getting better and better. So it's an important part of our business. We have more space to fill because of either bankruptcies or some of the larger folks because of COVID reducing their store counts. So we're proud of that business. We like working with entrepreneurs. We like finding the next finish line, the next LIDS. We don't know where it will be, but that's what our people try and do. And it also makes the real estate look and feel better than a vacancy. And if you walk one of our centers, I hope you feel like - obviously, there's frictional vacancy because if you're building out a store, somebody is moving in or out. But I want people to feel like it's full. The last thing you want to do is you walk down Madison Avenue, you know there's kind of a problem there, right? So when I - when they walk them all, I want them to feel like It feels good. So it's just a good, solid part of our business. I'm proud of what we do there, proud of the people that we lease to and that's a business we'll continue to foster again. Not always - doesn't always work out for the entrepreneur and for us, but it's something that we like to focus on. Vince Tibone : Makes sense. Thank you for the time. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Juan Sanabria : Good evening. I was just hoping to touch on Michael Bilerman's earlier question on the development and redevelopment schedule. Just saw the expected yields come down a tick on a couple of the different buckets. And I was just curious if that was more of a mix issue or if the underwriting has changed on expected rents or the time frames have widened out as a result of COVID? If you could provide any color, that would be helpful. Brian McDade : Juan, it's Brian. This is simply mix. Every time we produce the schedule every quarter, there's projects that come in and out. And so it's a mix change over time from the fourth quarter. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then, a second question is just on the retailer EBITDA contribution. I believe you spoke to a $260 million number for 2021. Just curious on what your sense for that number is now kind of pre-Eddie Bauer, if you have it handy? David Simon : Well, Eddie Bauer won't close - it will be higher, but Eddie Bauer won't close probably until two months? So it will be higher. How is that? Is that helpful? So I mean, the $260 million included our share of everything, including Penney. So we're above that now. So we're going to - hopefully. Again, retail is - does have its ebbs and flows. But we're projecting to be greater than that already without Eddie Bauer. And then, I think Eddie Bauer, once it closes, will clearly add to that. I mean, it's going to be a very good deal for SPARC there. I'm a little nervous because SPARC - my guys at SPARC have done a great job. Mark Miller, CEO; Dave Dick, CFO are thoughtful, conservative, great stewards of the brands, great partners of me and Jamie Salter of ABG. I'm just nervous because they were really excited about Eddie Bauer, and I'm like, \"You guys are never excited about anything. Now I'm nervous, OK?\" But no, we - they think it's going to be a great addition. Brian McDade : And Juan, just one thing to point out, obviously, is relative to our retail investments, we don't add back depreciation and amortization. So the FFO contribution is much less than the EBITDA contribution. Juan Sanabria : Yeah, thank you very much. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Your line is open. Greg McGinniss : Hey, David, just to maybe touch on that last question a little bit differently. On the last call, it was a $0.15 to $0.20 contribution to FFO from the retail investments. So is it fair now that there's a higher number assumed for the contribution of guidance? David Simon : Yeah, I think that's to say. I don't know, Greg, what the number is off the top of my head, but it should, hopefully, it will outperform our initial budget. Greg McGinniss : OK. And then, just kind of rounding out the guidance questions, could you tell us what's built in regarding additional lease cancellation income? David Simon : Nothing material. For the balance of the year, nothing material. Nothing on - nothing really in our radar. Greg McGinniss : OK, thank you very much. David Simon : Thank you. Thanks, Greg. Operator : There are no further questions on queue. I will turn the call over back to David Simon for any closing remarks. David Simon : Thank you. Thanks for your interest and all your questions and Look forward to talking to you soon. Take care. Operator : [Operator Instructions]",

For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good evening. I'm pleased to report our business is solid and improving, demand for space in our well-located properties is increasing. I will turn to some highlights. Our profitability and cash flow have significantly increased. Second-quarter funds from operations were $1.22 billion, or $3.24 per share. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter. Our international operations continue to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions, which cost us roughly $0.06 per share for this quarter compared to our expectations due to the equivalent of two and a half month of closures.  As we said in the press release, our quarter results included a non-cash gain of $118 million or $0.32 per share from the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klepierre. We generated over $1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, which was $125 million more than the first quarter. And additionally, compared to the second quarter of last year, our cash flow from operations was break-even due to the lockdown. Domestic international property NOI combined, increased 16.6% year-over-year for the quarter and 2.8% for the first half of the year. Remember, the First Quarter of 2020 was relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  These growth rates do not include any contribution from the Taubman portfolio or lease settlement income. Malls and outlets occupancy at the end of the Second Quarter was 91.8%, an increase of 100 basis points. compared to the first quarter. We continue to see demand for space across our portfolio from healthy local, regional, and national tenants, entrepreneurs, restaurateurs, and mixed-use demand, ever so increasing day-by-day. Our team is active in signing leases with new and exciting tenants.  The average base minimum rent was $50.03. Our average base rents was impacted by the initial lower base rents we agreed to in addressing certain tenant COVID negotiations in exchange for lower sales breakpoints, if variable rents that were recognized in the first half of the year were included, it would add approximately $5 per foot to our average base minimum rent. Leasing spreads declined again due to the mix of deals that are now included, as well as the activity that has fallen out of the spread, given its rolling 12-month nature and metric.  New leasing activity that has affected the spread include large footprint, entertainment, fitness, and large-scale retailers. These boxes -- big-box deals, reduced our opening rate as they are all included in our spread metric. As a reminder, the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for percentage rent-based income based on sales, as I mentioned just recently. Leasing activity accelerated in the quarter. We signed nearly 1400 leases for approximately 5.2 million square feet, and have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. Through the first 6 months, we signed 2500 leases for over 900 -- I'm sorry, 9.5 million square feet.  Our team executed leases for 3 million more square feet or over approximately 800 more deals compared to the first 6 months this year, as well as -- I'm sorry, compared to the first six months of 2019. We have completed nearly 90% of our expiring leases for 2021. We recently had a deal committee. And what I'm told by my leasing folks is that that was the most active deal committee that they've had in several years. Now, retail sales continue to increase. Total sales for the month of June were equal to 06/2019, and up 80% compared to last year. And were approximately 5% higher than May sales. If you exclude two well-known tenants, our mall sales were up 8% more than compared to 06/2019. Multiple regions in the U.S. recorded higher sales volume in June and for the second quarter compared to our 2019 levels.  We're active in redevelopment and new development. We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, and we started construction in the Western Paris suburb for our third outlet in France. At the end of the quarter, new development - redevelopment was underway across all our platforms. For our share of $850 million, our retail investments posted exceptional results. All of our global brands within SPARC Group outperformed their budget in the quarter on sales, gross margin, and EBITDA, led by Forever 21 and Aeropostale, SPARC's newest brand, Eddie Bauer, also outperformed our initial expectations.  We're also very pleased with JCPenney results. They continue to outperform their plan. Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.4 billion, and they do not have any outstanding balance on their line of credit. Penney will launch several private national brands later this year, as well as their new beauty initiative. Taubman Realty Group is operating their 2021 budget at a level above debt and above our underwriting. And their portfolio -- our portfolio shows resilience as sales are quickly returning to pre-pandemic levels.  Year-to-date through June, retail sales are 13% higher than the first half of the 2019 balance sheet. As you would expect, we've been very active in the capital markets. We refinanced 13 mortgages in the first half of the year for a total of $2.2 billion in total, our share of which is $1.3 billion, at an average interest rate of 2.9%. Our liquidity is more than $8.8 billion, consisting of 6.9 billion available on our credit facility, and $1.9 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash, and again, our liquidity is net of $500 million of U.S. commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end. Dividend.  We paid $1.40 per share of dividend in cash on July 23rd for the second quarter. That was a 7.7% increase sequentially and year-over-year. Today, we announced our third-quarter dividend of $1.50 per share in cash, which is an increase of 7.1% sequentially, and 15.4% -- 15.4% year-over-year. The dividend is payable on September 30. You will know that going forward, we are returning to our historical cadence of declaring dividends as we announce our quarterly earnings. Now, guidance. Given our results for the first half of the year, as well as our view for the remainder of 2021, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance range from $9.70 to $9.80 per share to $10.70 to $10.80 per share. This is an increase of $1 per share at the midpoint, and the range represents approximately 17% to 19% growth compared to 2020 results. Before we open it up to Q&A, I wanted to provide some additional perspective. First, we expect to generate approximately $4 billion in FFO this year.  That will be approximately a 25% increase compared to last year and just 5% below our 2019 number. To be just 5% below 2019, given all that we have endured over the last 15, 16 months, including significant restrictive governmental orders that force us to shut down, unlike many other establishments, is a testament to our portfolio and a real testament to the Simon team and people. Second, we expect to distribute more than $2 billion in dividends this year.  Keep in mind, we did not suspend our dividend at any point during the pandemic and in fact, we have now increased our dividend twice already this year. Now, just a point on valuation, and I tend to never really talk about it, but I felt it was appropriate today. Our valuation continues to be well below our historical averages when it comes to FFO multiples compared to other retail reach - retailers and the S&P 500. And our dividend yield is higher than the S&P 500 by more than 250 basis points, treasuries by 325 basis points, and the REIT industry by a 150-basis point. And as I mentioned to you, our dividend is growing. Our Company has a diverse product offering that possesses many, many multiple drivers of earnings growth, accretive capital investment opportunities, and a balance sheet to support our growth. We are increasing our performance, profitability, cash flow, and return to our shareholders. And we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good afternoon, David. I wanted to just start on the occupancy trend, which was up pretty nicely from 1Q to 2Q. And you talked about the leasing activity that you had in the quarter in the pipeline. Could you just maybe share with us what your expectations are for occupancy by the end of this year, and what's embedded in the guidance? David Simon : Well, the guidance is affected by the continuing uptrend. We expect our occupancy by year-end to increase from the levels that we have right now. I don't have a number that I am going to give to you specifically, but as I mentioned to you, Steve, talking to my heads of leasing, we are -- maybe this is an overstatement, we're tickled pink by the demand by the new retailers and tenants that are surfacing. The many, many opportunities that we have with restaurants, with the mixed-use developments, and I mentioned to you, our deal committee had more deals than it's had in a few years. Look, we still have a hole to dig out of, because of the bankruptcies that we had to confront, with the pandemic. But I'm very pleased with the activity, the mojo that we have in leasing the work that our personnel are doing there. The creativity, it's pretty encouraging. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on the leasing commentary. I know that you guys had to make some accommodations to the retailers and you lowered the base rent and took more percentage rent. Given that sales seem to be coming back very quickly, do you sense that that dynamic is changing at all as you\u2019re having these current discussions about future leasing? Or do you still anticipate having to have a kind of lower base and take more upside going forward? David Simon : Look, it's tenant by tenant. The strategy we adopted at the height of the pandemic is playing out better than we could have expected. We made the right move. We got the renewals done. We accommodated the vast majority of retailers, assuming they were reasonable in their approach. We got the job done.  We kept our properties functioning. We bet on the rebound, and we're seeing the benefits of that. And as I look back, I'm not certain I would change a lot. And the reality is, there is always going to be a few handful situations where we'll bet on to come, bet on retailers because we have confidence in our properties, we have the confidence in the retailers that we're doing business with.  And I think physical retail, when I listen to the pundits, and they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, read my lips, physical retail is here to stay. And people really like to shop in the physical world. Don't believe everything you hear on TV. We've got the evidence. Steve Sakwa : That's it for me. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please, go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Good afternoon, David. And hope -- I guess you guys have had a really good -- not, I guess. You guys have had a really good quarter, just amazing to see guidance up by a buck. But continuing on Steve's question there. Amazing on the dividend rebound, amazing on the guidance, on the leasing activity you guys talked about, and everything is good. But when you think about people pulling out the negative, and believe it or not, David, people do look at some things in the negative limelight, they will see negative 22% re-leasing spreads, and that negative spread is widening.  I understand that you did deals to get the Company through, makes sense. But from an expectation standpoint, what would you think the cadence is over the next few quarters of this spread, and how do we relate to that versus the cash flow growth and everything else that's going on? Because, clearly, there's a disconnect between your cash flow recovery and this negative spread metric? David Simon : Yeah. Look, I -- Alex, stats don't mean as much to me as they do to you because I look at cash flow growth. Because there's a lot that goes into cash flow growth, a lot more than spreads. Now, the sole reason that the spread is down to 22% is because of the mix and the COVID deals that we did. The mix is that we -- the spread probably was higher than -- because we had a lot of boxes that rolled out that were low rent, and so we got the benefit of that. And now as we -- and those were out of our 12-month numbers. And now, the new leasing that we're doing is in it and that's the sole thing. So, I would encourage our investors that know what we're all about to understand that it's a mix. If I do a deal with Dick's or an entertainment box and they paid $15 a foot but the expiration of that box was 15 months ago with $3 a foot, I still may have made a $15 spread. But because it was in our rollout 15 months ago, you don't see it.  It's not space by space. If I get to space by space, the trend would not be -- the percentage would not be anywhere near that. So, do you understand what I just explained? Remember, we had a lot of boxes that were pre-COVID at low rents. But we didn't do box leasing for the last 12, 14 months because of the pandemic. So that's the sole reason. You follow what I'm saying. Right, Alex? Alexander Goldfarb : Yeah. I do. I wasn't about to volunteer Tom, rehash for a space-by-space. But I do understand what you're saying. David Simon : This is not space by space. But the reality is if I add boxes that were -- that space that I got back that was at low numbers but they were 15 months ago, those closings is gone. So that really jerks up the number. And then I have the new lease that's at a low number, that jerks it down. But if you really compare it over a longer period of time, we've got a positive spread. Follow me? Alexander Goldfarb : Yeah, it makes total sense. The next topic, David, obviously -- David Simon : It should make more than sense, it's the math. Alexander Goldfarb : No, I can see the math as evidence in the earnings growth, the cash flow growth. You've explained it well so that when understanding this, that explanation that it's not based on space-by-space makes it crystal clear what's going on. The next question is on the rising of COVID Delta, and whatever other variance there are out there, obviously. Facts of life. But you're seeing tremendous leasing demand, restaurant demand, et cetera.  Your malls and outlets are throughout the country. Is it your view and what your managers -- mall managers are saying, and tenants are saying, is that most people just accept COVID is part of life and, therefore, it doesn't interfere with their shopping or their restaurants or their activity, or is there a concern that people may start to pull back from some of the increased activity that we've seen this year? David Simon : Well, it's a very good question. I'm only going to give you my personal opinion, which could be wrong. But it's an opinion, so I guess, technically, it shouldn't be wrong. But I would say this, I think the most important -- this is factual and I actually checked it. So, as you know, Delta, to our Delta hotspots, we actually have malls in some of these hotspots. So, the land of the Ozarks is in Springfield, Missouri. You only know that through the Netflix Show, right? The Ozarks. Because you haven't been there, but I've been there. And it's a wonderful place. But I checked Have we seen it in our battlefield ball, which is in Springfield, Missouri? Have we seen an uptick in COVID cases at the mall? We get the report from all the retailers and our staff. And the reality is, we haven't. The mall is safe. Even though we're starting to see counties talk about indoors, there's no science about the mall. I underline that. We've been mistreated in this whole 18-month ordeal, but it is what it is.  I personally think, now going back to your question, And I've checked it. In Florida where there are some upticks. We have not seen in an enclosed mall an uptick in COVID cases for the people that are in the mall, the staff, whether it's a retail or a management team, period, end of the story. No question about that. So, I personally think that people are just going to deal with Delta. I'm hopeful that people will get vaccinated. We're not going to mandate vaccines; we're going to encourage them. And I think we've got to keep being safe as possible going on with our lives. And where we need to mask up, we're going to mask up. And I think the consumer and the folks have all just dealt with it and are moving forward in that environment right now. So, I'm hopeful that as a country we don't get into these lockdowns they have produced. We -- I studied Sweden, I studied France, COVID reverts to the mean. Sweden did not lockdown, France did. And if you look at the chart on COVID cases, it all reverts to the mean; lockdown, no lockdown. So let us do our business, mask up if you need to, the mall is safe, next question. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Rich Hill : Good afternoon, David. I want to just focus on maybe just some of the numbers and specifically the income from unconsolidated entities. If I'm looking at the numbers right, you got a pretty healthy increase in that line item, which obviously includes Taubman along with the retailers. I think it went to around 348.5 million versus 15 million the last quarter despite depreciation amortization, looking like it's approximately flat year-over-year. That suggests to me something pretty healthy is happening in those line items. I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little bit more transparency and what you're seeing there and what's driving that beyond what you said in the prepared remarks? David Simon : Well, we're always transparent. That'll be in our queue. But we have our Klepierre deferred tax gain running through that. We have our retail investments running through that, or the two major pieces of that increase. And then obviously, positive operations in all of our joint venture properties. And that's really at Taubman because we've had that lunge through that as well, but we also have increased depreciation and amortization associated with it. That's a not-overly material in that big increase. Fellas, what else do we want to say? That's it? Tom Ward : That's it. David Simon : Okay. Fellas agree with my assessment. Rich Hill : Thank you. I'm sure I'll follow up offline with Brian and Tom on that. I do want to come back to, my words not yours, soft guidance on core NOI. I think you've said in the past, it was maybe going to be 4 to 5, closer to 5, if I'm reading the transcript in last quarter correctly. You obviously just had a really big quarter. How do you feel about that now? And do you see the potential for upside from that 5%? David Simon : Yes, we should outperform that. Rich Hill : Okay, that's my 2 questions. So, I will get back in the queue. Thanks, David. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Great. Just 2 quick ones. One quick one and maybe one a little bit longer. The first one, just on the dollar increase, can you just break that down to just some major buckets? The buck increase to the guidance of about 380 million. I would assume part of its $0.32, the deferred tax liability that you booked this quarter, which leaves another $0.68 unaccounted for. Maybe if you can just bucket it into like maybe retailer investments, core, and others would be helpful. David Simon : You're right. You're right. $0.32 of that is because of the deferred tax and then $0.68 plus is from just core-plus retail. but I -- we're not going to break out that which is which. But the good news is, we've got our core beating our initial budget. And retail, the same -- we're in the same spot. Michael Bilerman : Yeah, because your original retailer investment was like $0.15 to $0.20. It would appear that you may have blown through that just in this quarter. So that's what I was just trying to get a little bit and they -- that one's a lot more volatile, right? David Simon : It's entirely a fair and legitimate question and so there are no qualms on that. It's just we don't really -- we're not breaking out the beat or the increase, I should say, other than the $0.32, which is right. And then the other 68, and I hope it will be plus than that, will be as retail and core. Michael Bilerman : Right. And is a [Indiscernible] supporting the line. David Simon : I mean, that's the retailer multiples, maybe retail is core. I don't -- what's a core? What's non-core? Michael Bilerman : That's a longer discussion. The second question, David, is, given your perspective now, as a, obviously, you've been a landlord forever, but you're increasingly now getting your hands dirty at being a retailer. I'm curious what you're seeing from the retailers that you own and sort of dealing with this environment and turning it around relative to what you are as a landlord, right? Because I think you said your tickled pink.  If you're seeing it as a retailer, that must be a different description that you would use. So maybe you can talk a little bit about what you're doing on the retailer side to bring people into the assets, what type of promotions are you trying to lure people to brick-and-mortar, and just the whole omnichannel world with the retailers you own. I'm just trying to understand that relative to your time as a landlord? David Simon : Well, you're right. That's a long -- if I did that question justice, it would be a long answer. Let me just say this, and this is really important, the retailers that we bought, if we didn't buy them, would be gone. So, I'm most proud -- forget about the numbers and what it's meant for us financially, but we're most proud because we basically kept companies alive that otherwise would be dead, buried, and liquidated.  And what we found out is, you know what, if we just focus on the business, focus on cash flow, focus on the consumer, we could stabilize this business, have patient money, patient -- not worried about comp from one quarter to the next. We could turn those around. And I'm most proud because, I should know, maybe Brian knows but, our SPARC operations employ thousands of people. And then when you add Penney, you've got well over 50,000, 60,000 people.  Don't underestimate what we've done. We're not -- these were companies that were, frankly, roadkill. and we save them. And for that, I'm very, very thankful. So that's one. And then, I think, Michael, generally and -- I can get into this in more detail, it's just too much to tell you now. I'd say 2 things. One is the store is credit. If you talk to the retailers that run these businesses, and in our case in particular, because most of these companies didn't have the capital to invest in the Internet and the omni-channel. We're taking it at the store level, okay? So, these are really turned in to be good physical store operators. Now, Eddie Bauer is more sophisticated in E-commerce than some of the other ones that we got when we bought them. But the store is a really, really important component that gets in today's world. For what -- it is what it is, gets overlooked. And I'd say we've also had a great partner in ABG that adds a lot to the marketing and know-how about sourcing that was very important to what we have. And then Brookfield has been a terrific partner as well and adds a lot of value. They're in some deals, they've been converted in others, but they've been like us. What do we do that's right for the business? How do we keep these companies alive and prosper level-headed discussions? They're all the rest of the stuff. Omnichannel, clearly, is very important to the future, but these companies are basically surviving and prospering because of their physical footprint, not because of e-commerce. Michael Bilerman : I would say if I have a vote, and I know you probably wouldn't give me a vote, but on the retailer versus core Simon earnings, I do think there's a difference. The market can ascribe what multiple they want. You're in a -- you have leases and contracts, retailers on the other end of just a different business model. David Simon : I -- traditionally, you're right in that, but if you look at where the retailer multiples are, compared to ours, you would argue the reverse. Michael Bilerman : That's why I said I don't want to -- the market is going to tell us where, but at least having all the details of the components, I think it's just a very helpful piece of information that the street can earn. And then we can get into an argument about how things should be valued, but not having the individual pieces in a clear and concise way. I don't think allows us to have that conversation. It becomes a little bit more adversarial. David Simon : We got it. We understand the issue. But at the end of the day, we'll see the level of materiality to it, and we'll see if it makes sense. We've got partners in there as well. But I don't think -- well, let's -- the market is the market. I have to respect it. We hear what you're saying. Michael Bilerman : Okay. I appreciate the time, David. David Simon : Thank you, Michael. Michael Bilerman : Have a good one. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. I was just wondering maybe if we could talk a little bit about the conversations you're having with retailers. I think in the past, and even last quarter, it sounded like there were still retailers that were maybe giving you a hard time about rent payment or rent negotiations. Wondering if you can give an update on how those conversations with the retailers are going, and also whether that is impacting the lease termination fees. David Simon : I would say we're really down to a couple of folks, and it's really caving way, way down. Everybody has lived up to there, basically, COVID deal. I would say, right now, other than 1 or 2 folks, it's really business as usual and how do we do business better, how do we grow our business, how do we do things more strategically.  So, I think -- I am hopeful that that whole unfortunate -- it was tough for us. It was tough for them. We're all dealing with the unprecedented sequence of events. I think it's all behind us. Our collection rates are in the back to normal, and yes, we've got 2 or 3 folks that are still out there. But if we -- if they stay out there, it is what it is, and we can't -- we'll -- we're moving forward, so it's all pretty much behind us, assuming there's nothing that we had to deal with like we did last year. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick one on the other income, both the lease settlement income was up decently in the quarter and also the bucket for other income. So, I was just wondering if you could give some detail on these few line items. David Simon : Yeah. I remember lease settlement income was up a few million dollars, not much. Maybe a couple of cents. And we sold 1 residential property at a gain and we also had, which is -- we had a significant increase in our Simon Brand Venture business, which is that probably the bigger grower of that number. Brian McDade : Absolutely. Caitlin, it's Brian. If you -- we saw a pretty substantial increase in Simon Brand Ventures, our gift card business, and some of our mall food operations, which, obviously, in the second quarter of last year, were non-existent. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Good evening. What do you need to see in order to green-light additional transformational mixed-use projects, especially the Taubman assets which we think make a lot of sense? Clearly, Northgate never skipped a beat. And now, Phipps Plaza really looks like it's back on track. Maybe I missed it earlier, David, but I recall the office component being temporarily shelled, but what do you need to see to ramp additional transformational-type projects, and is there a laddered development program in place or any material ongoing, in-process entitlement request you can share? David Simon : Sure. You're right about Phipps. We're basically all systems go there. We expect to finish everything by the end of '22, which would be the new Class A office, Nobu Hotel, Life Time athletics. So, it's all going back. You're right. We did shut it down during COVID. We commenced -- we restarted this, I don't know, two, three months ago.  We want to approve some of the stuff earlier, but we really are finishing the projects. So that's -- that'll be really -- I'm really excited about that. So hopefully we'll be able to show you that and be something really proud of. And I would say we're really -- we took a hiatus of 12 months, more or less.  Brian, right? 12, 14 months. So, we're back at it. I think I mentioned the last call, we're probably, in some cases, decreasing the amount of maybe new retail space. But we're back at it and it's more mixed-use than ever. The demand on the mixed-use front has been really, really nice to see.  And just to name a few that were in the permitting process would be Brea in Orange County, we've got Stoneridge in the Northern California area just to get the permitting process going -- restarted. Some of those things we have to start again because the plans different. But the idea to redevelop, a lot of them are the old department store boxes that we got back or that we ended up buying. We're going. The plans maybe a little less grandiose, so to speak, but it's very active on that front, across the board.  So, we look for more and more of our pipeline to increase as we go through the betting process. And I think with the Taubman portfolio, you're right. There's a lot to do there. They didn't -- they -- I keep saying they, but we don't have a lot of empty boxes there. That was -- so there's not like the plethora of opportunities that you might otherwise think. But there are some, and we're working -- we're working those as well and its great real estate, great location. And I think I mentioned the last call, I mean, I do think not that there's really a silver lining in any of this, but I do think our properties, both by the communities and maybe the general movement there, the suburbs are -- especially in markets that we're in, are going to be really appreciated. And I think we're going to be the center of activity. Derek Johnston : Okay, great. Thank you. And I guess just my follow-up will be a quick follow-up to this question. Is the 13-story Class-A office building, is Life Time coworker and anchor tenant there? Did you sign them? Or have you pre-leased any of this space that gave you the confidence to move ahead? Or are you just moving ahead because you feel better in general? David Simon : Let me be clear. Life Time is its own separate building. It's actually built on top of a world-class food hall that we're doing with C3. And inside Life Time athletic, they will have their own co-working. The office building is on its own. It's not -- there's no leasing the Life Time on that. It's 13 stories. We're building it spec, though we just signed our first 90,000 square foot lease. The short answer is, yes, we are going. Derek Johnston : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Looking at the guidance for 2021, you'll have recovered half of the loss from your previous peak on FFO per share. I'm wondering if, as you work on creating the income to get you back to the second half, is that going to be harder than the first half or could that be easier? David Simon : Just a quarter-over-quarter? Craig Schmidt : I'm just -- David Simon : Not really -- I didn't really -- I don't think anybody understood your -- your connection's not that good, Craig. So maybe, can you restate it, please? Craig Schmidt : Sorry, can you hear me now? David Simon : Yes. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Your guidance for 2021 already brings you halfway back to your peak FFO per share. Thinking about the second half, is that going to be harder to recover or easier. David Simon : If you go quarter-over-quarter, I would just say, and I'll let Brian and Adam weigh in. But we had the brunt of COVID abatements and relief of defaults in Q2 and Q3 if I remember correctly. The comparison to Q3 of '21 compared to '20 should be a pretty big gap for -- like Q4, we had dealt with most of the stuff. If that's your question, I'm not sure I really, maybe, comprehend it completely. But if that's your question, hopefully, that answers it. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then just -- do you foresee any changes in the REIT rules that might allow you to grow your retail or some of your other businesses beyond previous limitations? David Simon : Well, that's hard to know, Craig, I'm hopeful. There are limitations. You're right, 100% right. There are limitations. And I'm hopeful that the folks that do legislate this stuff will understand the benefit that we've provided to basically working families because we've saved these retailers. So yes, there are rules that make it complicated. They should be less. Remember, our retail investments are in a taxable REIT subsidiary. If you look at our P&L, you will see a big tax expense. Correct, gentlemen? That's associated with the fact that our TRS is taxable, and we're paying the corporate tax rate at its full level. And then when you look at the -- hopefully, the benefit of what we've done for these companies that otherwise would not exist frankly, that the folks that write legislation will see that this is really an arcane rule that was around a long time ago. And there's a real benefit to try and keep retailers and others alive to try and create employment and all that good stuff that they do in the community. So, I am hopeful, but there's no certainty on that. Craig Schmidt : Understood. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you, Craig. Operator : Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum of Compass Point. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks for taking my question. David, I have a feeling of Deja vu, what we've seen this picture before following the great financial crisis. Obviously, things are different of course, but it seems like we're reliving those times a bit. Maybe if you can -- my question to you is -- it's regarding tenant sales. Again, the key lifeblood to your malls and the key to the, obviously, to the retailer profitability too. Very encouraged by your statement of retail sales in June equaling -- in your portfolio equaling 19 levels and up 5% from May. Maybe if you can give some more breakdown in that, particularly as it comes out of the first quarter, and also did I hear you correctly? Did you say that Taubman sales were 13% ahead of ' 19 levels? David Simon : Correct, yes. Floris van Dijkum : Does that -- David Simon : I mean, it's a good number. Look, I do think we all deal a force in a very tough predict -- it's really hard to make any predictions. But I think what it should tell all of us is that, and I said a little bit earlier, physical shopping is -- people like to physically shop. We are, by no stretch of the imagination, hitting on all cylinders. We still have tourist centers that don't have tourists, other than domestic. We have parts of the region that were slower to open up, i.e., California, than others.  And I just think the most important point is that people like physical shopping, and, listen, you hear it all the time and I'm sure you get -- Your clients ask you, well nobody shops physically anymore and you try to defend it. Or you'd say, \"Yeah, but what about this? What about that?\" I think we're just -- we're showing that it matters to the consumer and to these communities. And hopefully, that will continue. And it is -- I will say this, maybe getting to your question, it is across the board. So, it's -- yes.  It's the luxury retailers, but it's also Aeropostale, which the AUM is -- I won't tell you, I'm not allowed. I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you, but the AUM is lower than what it might be for a luxury retailer. Okay? So, it's just Forever 21, which has a lower AUM. So, I think that's just encouraging. Hopefully, the trend will continue. But I think the consumer likes the idea that they can go to a physical shopping place. Floris van Dijkum : Great. And if I can follow up, I guess, I wanted to -- you talked about the fact that your lease spreads are not -- they're not space-for-space, like-for-like. I wonder if you had that. And also, what is the impact if you have -- if your average sales get to 19 levels, what's the impact on the effective rent that you would be getting relative to the reported rents that you've talked about? David Simon : Well, I think the easiest way to do that, I mean, that's a complicated number because you've got to go retailer by retailer. We did for the first six months. And our estimate of what our base rent would be based upon -- we got the benefit. There's $5 more base rent had we not lowered our breakpoints due to the COVID reliefs. So that gives you an indication of an interesting stat if that's maybe it's of interest to you. So, I don't -- Floris van Dijkum : Have you -- David Simon : So, I can't really give you a number off the top of my head. It would just be a guess and I really don't want to do that on what it might be. And then again on the spreads, it's not space by space. A lot of people, and I know the burdens on you and the analytic community, but I'd really encourage you; very few people do it the way we do it. Most people do it space-by-space. Some people also include their estimate of if they have a base rent of acts and they think they're going to be in percent rent.  They include that in their spreads. We just -- it's all in and all out, mix matters because of these boxes I explained to you and you know what? It will manifest itself in the cash flow. And the big cash flow growth story that we have going forward is sales growth and put sales growth and occupancy growth, and SPB growth, getting that back to normal. That's the big story. And then lease -- so the spreads -- the spreads -- yeah, I could do a bunch of boxes. The spreads can look not as good as you had looked historically, but the reality is, Mike, cash flow went up because that was vacant space and it's already out of the spread calculation. Focus on cash flow growth, is the bottom line. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks, David. Appreciate it. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Mueller : So Q2 looks like it was about 292 without the reversal. And if you look at the 1075 guidance, it implies about a 250-a - quarter average for the balance of the year. What was the level of the number of incomes that won't recur into the back -- no, sorry? What was the level of income in 2Q that won't recur going forward? David Simon : I'm not sure. Tom Ward : Say that one more time, Michael. Can you go through that question again, please? Mike Mueller : Yeah -- David Simon : The only thing that's -- the only -- let me say it this way. The only thing that's not going to recur is the Klepierre deferred tax gain. Again, I can't tell you exactly what retail sales are going to be, retailer sales. I can't tell you what our retail investments are going to be.  There is -- but the only thing that's non-recurring, we will always have certain non-recurring things every year, lease settlement income, sale of an income-producing property. These things always ebb and flow. But the only thing that is not going to recur is the deferred tax. That's a one-time gain, clearly articulated in our press release of $0.32. Mike Mueller : What about prior period collections, were there any in there that were significant? David Simon : No, they wouldn't come through the P&L either. Tom Ward : We saw no recovery, Michael. David Simon : Yeah. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone of Green Street. Your line is open. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good afternoon. It seems clear that variable rent is growing in the portfolio. I'm just -- could you help frame how much this is shifting? As for the leases you are negotiating today, what is the split between contractual rent and the expected variable rent component? And how is that different from before the pandemic? David Simon : Well, look, I think that the answer -- the simple way to say this is that if we have -- if we are willing to bet in some cases, on the prospect of our property and our retailer. And to the extent that they are cautious because of what they had to deal with as well, we're willing to accept the lower base rent in some cases, if we get an artificial upside in other cases. And it's not anywhere near the majority. It's only dealing with certain cases, certain lease rollovers. And again, those lease rollovers happen let's say on average, we have 12% a year that rolls over.  Now, last year, we had more, only because we dealt with bankruptcies, which in theory, when you're in bankruptcy, all of your lease\u2019s rollovers because you have the right to reject leases. So, we did a little bit more last year with some of the brands that went through bankruptcy, because it was at the height of the pandemic, and they were cautious with their plan.  But we made artificially low breakpoints to make some of the income back-ups with the sales set. I would say going forward, we are pretty much back to the normal way to do it, which is trying to get the appropriate base rent and a natural break over that to generate percentage rent. And I will -- Vince Tibone : Got it. David Simon : -- I will say this. We are still really important. We're still not -- we used to have big, big overage rent numbers from our outlet portfolio because of the foreign tours, and we're still not seeing that. Obviously, tourism dropped during the last couple of years pre-pandemic, strong dollar relationships with countries, et cetera. I won't go through all that stuff. Then we had the pandemic and the restriction. So, one of the unique things that I think and I hope, not knowing Delta or anything else, is how it's all going to play out. But at some point, in the not-too-distant future, we're going to see really good growth in our high-quality tourism centers, which should manifest itself in additional percentage rent. We have yet to see that for primarily our outlet, but also our Vegas properties as well. We're like a forum shop. Vince Tibone : No. Thank you. That's a really helpful color. I mean, it sounds like the lease structure is more temporary versus the secular shift towards more available rent. So, I appreciate the color there. One more for me, maybe just shifting gears. I mean, you were fairly active in the mortgage market in recent months. Just was hoping you could provide some color on the recent trends there and just the ability for both you and other than the industry to get non-recourse financing on high-quality malls today. David Simon : I'd say it's significantly improved, but not easy. Not a day at the beach. Retail is still -- look, I think a quarter like this, a couple of other quarters, pandemic in the rearview mirror, I expect it to get back to normal, but it's still not. That market is still difficult. The unique thing about us is we have an unsecured market for us and we don't necessarily need the mortgage market. Sponsorship is really, really important. But it's dramatically improved, but it's not where it needs to be, where it should be, and where it has been. Vince Tibone : Yeah, that makes sense. If you had to draw, maybe, a line with them for sale per square foot or quality in terms of being able to get debt, is there anything you already want to throw out there? David Simon : Look, I think we've done the pentagon cities of the world. We've done those in a really good solid mall in a not [Indiscernible] town. It's tougher and it shouldn't be because the stability of that cash flow is frankly pretty good under our management and ownership. So -- but often to -- like we did domain. We had old real estate parlance. We over-financed it. The Pentagon City of the world is fine. But if you have that traditional mall and a smaller market, even though it's really good, really solid, really stable, still is more difficult than it should be, in my opinion. Vince Tibone : Interesting. Well, thank you for the time. David Simon : Sure. Thanks, Vince. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you talk about the retailer investments, the 195 million of NOI? I would've thought, you would have gotten that type of level of income towards the fourth quarter. You've just given us the seasonality that that's inherent in retail. So, I'm just trying to think about that compared to your previous guidance of 260 million of EBITDA, and should we expect a similarly strong quarter in the fourth quarter, or is there something unique that happened this time around? David Simon : Well, again, remember, this is all -- you're right, you're 100% right, in that like traditional retailers, a lot of it is back-end weighted. We budget the same way. We way outperformed our first six months. It's hard to know exactly what it will be in the next 6 months. But we budget to ramp up too, Ki Bin, so we'll see whether we're on a budget, above budget, below budget. I mean it's -- but we budget that ramp up as well. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. So, there wasn't anything unique to this quarter that would appear like a one-time item or anything like that? David Simon : Other than dramatic outperformance. That was what's unique about it. Tom Ward : Yeah. No one-time items [Indiscernible] perform. David Simon : Yeah. Ki Bin Kim : All right. And what are your latest thoughts on acquisitions? It's a bit ask out there how that compares to your internal hurdles, just any color you can share on that. David Simon : Well, we really -- it's really -- there's no action. We've got -- I mean I don't know if I should say this publicly, but it's a little late now. I mean, there's -- we're really not looking at anything that I know of. There's really no action, so it's really hard for me to comment on it because there's just not much happening. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Your line is open. Linda Tsai : Hi. With the pandemic driving more buy online and pickup in-store, how do you think retailers are considering their occupancy cost ratios? And is this a similar approach to the way the retailers you've invested in also approach occupancy cost ratios? David Simon : Well, that's like there's no standard answer other than to say we are, if they buy online and pickup in-store, that sale goes through our lease, that sale goes into our sales calculation. It's not like it's excluded, so that's going to be part of our occupancy cost discussion. Linda Tsai : Got it. And then any sense of how the comps have trended for your retailer investments the past couple of months as maybe it relates to 2019 levels? David Simon : How the retail -- how our retail investments did to '19? Linda Tsai : Yeah, like a same-store sale. David Simon : Yeah. I would say, generally, above '19, except for JCPenney because they really were not in bankruptcy in '19. We're still having bankruptcy. They went into bankruptcy in 2020, early 2020. They had a lot less unaffected year. We're still below ' 19 levels, but the rest of them are above ' 19 levels pretty, pretty handsomely. Linda Tsai : Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good evening, out there. David Simon : We're out here. Haendel St. Juste: I wanted to come back to leasing for a second. Clearly, the industry has gone through some changes here in the last year. Few shorter-term deals are being done. Percentage rent deals are a bit more prevalent. I guess I'm curious, as you look at the U.S. mall business here over the next year or two, and more especially in the period from '23 to '25.  I'm thinking about how do you assess the likelihood that leases perhaps don't necessarily go back to being long-term with fixed-rate contractual rent bumps, or maybe they become more like in Asia where they are more percentage rent, and perhaps the leases are shorter in nature. And so, I guess I'm curious, as you seeing what you are seeing, the tone of the conversations, what your thoughts are on there, and maybe some color on the average change in lease term here being signed in the portfolio the last couple of months. David Simon : The term hasn't changed all that significantly. I would -- look, I would say that I don't think there is a big fundamental shift. When you tend to go short-term, it's because you can agree on what you think the fair market value is. And so, you do a short-term deal. And, again, there's some cautiousness from the retail community because of the pandemic. But, I think, assuming we get over this, I think it's -- we're going to see long-term deals.  We also use short-term deals to our advantage because one is, we may be testing on a new concept, one is, we don't like the rent that the retailer is offering, so let's keep that retailer in there while we go find a better long-term tenant. There's redevelopment, we want to move people around. There are all sorts of strategic reasons to do short-term leases. But I think that's -- the simple straightforward answer is I don't think that the fundamental nature of our business has changed in terms of long-term leases.  Listen, the retailers if they are investing in the store, the better retailers want long-term leases because they want the right, they want the store to look good, they want their personnel to be there. They don't want to go through different personnel. Personnel at the store levels, know when leases are short. And when leases are long, they're more committed to that Company. there is motivation in many, many cases, as we are to have long-term leases.  So, I really don't think other than because of the nature of the pandemic, that the short-term leases are de facto the new industry. I just don't see it. No retailers going to invest in a store without long-term leases. And all the better retailers. All with a good physical plan. All want to put in their omnichannel capabilities and they're not going to do that on the short-term lease. Haendel St. Juste: I got you and I appreciate those comments. I was just trying to understand that if you have any concern on your part by perhaps the lease exploration schedule that's building up here, over the next couple of years, with some of the shorter-term leases that have been signed over the last year or two, adding on top of the normal lease expiration schedule, especially in that 2023 to '25 period in which you'll be anniversary again. I think some tougher comps from leases signed 7-10 years ago. David Simon : Yeah. Look, I think, again, because of the quality of our portfolio, I'm not concerned about that. The reality is, we may be negotiating from a position of better position because our properties look great. Sales are great. People -- a lot of the physical retail has dissipated in the markets where the action is.  So, we've made those bets all the time, that we're going to bet on the future. And if we don't -- we can't make a long-term deal. We make it short because we're betting on the future and we've been right more than we've been wrong in those bets. But we're not always right. But that's the judgment that we have to make and we make it reasonably well in my opinion. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. And a follow-up, if I could, on these leasing spreads, understanding that that's been impacted by some of the leases you are doing with the lower-percentage rent thresholds, I guess I'm curious. When you provide -- David Simon : It's a little bit of that, but it's primarily the mix as I'd say -- as I've stated. And again -- Haendel St. Juste: Okay. David Simon : -- it's not straightforward spreads. Haendel St. Juste: Understood. I was just curious if you were able to provide a figure net of these newer leases that have been done here with the lower-percentage rent thresholds. David Simon : I mean, we could -- let me just say this, we could paint an unbelievably good picture there, but we just put all the stuff in, and the number is the number. So, if we went space-by-space, if we did it over a certain period of time, if we -- there are all sorts of ways you could create the number we would want you to focus on. But it's just a number to us. It's not what's driving our business. Okay? Haendel St. Juste: Alright. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg McGinnis of Scotiabank. Your line is open. Greg McGinnis : Hey, David. Hi, team. I think one of the key concerns for investors today is the potential longer-term drag from lower-quality assets, maybe at least not if they remain primarily retail. How are you thinking about investing, or maybe not investing, in the different quality bands within your portfolio to extract the most long-term value from those assets? David Simon : Really not much of an issue for us. It's a de minimis number and it's like any other Company. If you have a profitable business, maybe you don't invest in it if you don't think the growth is there and you meet the cash flow. But if investors are concerned about that, my initial reaction is we should do a better job of explaining the quality of our portfolio, and the depth and breadth of our business. So, we encourage you to have them call us.  We'd be more than happy to walk through the portfolio, answer any questions that they have on it. But I don't think after that, they would come away with that being a real concern. If that does happen, it's on the margin. $0.03, $0.05, something like that. So, anybody that's concerned about that, please call me, Brian, or Tom. Or you can set it up and we'll walk them through the asset base. Greg McGinnis : All right. Appreciate that. Could you possibly touch on maybe how the operating performance differs between the higher end and the lower end? We used to get those NOI weighted numbers, which were helpful, but just curious how that performance is going today. David Simon : I have them -- they're pretty -- I have them somewhere. Yeah, let's see. Basically, occupancy in the EBITDA weighted is 93 to 91.8. And average base minimum rent is higher, obviously, but the spreads about the same, and the total rents about the same. And sales are rolling 12, or pretty consistent on a percent basis. But the rolling 12, when you can't -- remember, rolling 12, we have 3 months of downtime, so it's irrelevant. But the most important number is occupancy and it's a little bit better. Greg McGinnis : Okay. Really what I'm trying to understand, and what others are trying to understand, is whether or not there's any need for a higher level of dispositions post-pandemic or maybe just as the retail market evolves, and how the portfolio is coming to address them all. David Simon : We've got -- we've always been selling. We just sold the residential thing at a -- like a below sub-4 cap rate. There are a couple of retail properties that we've earmarked for sale. Markets are not quite there. We'll see what happens. Thank you. Greg McGinnis : All right. thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Please, go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Just wanted to hit on the guidance question again because it seems like you guys have outperformed expectations on the retail side on your investments, but the guidance implies that de-sell kind of x the one time from Klepierre. Should we just think that that is just conservatism built-in for the second half, given the volatility on the retail side? Or is there another reason for the sequential implied decline in the back half from a clean second-quarter run rate number? David Simon : Well, look, I think all I can tell you is that we have beaten our first quarter, our second quarter. We hope to beat third and we hope to beat the fourth, but we're in the midst of the third and we're in the midst of the fourth, and we'll see how it -- how it shakes out. But we feel, as I mentioned to you earlier, we feel pretty good as to where we're positioned. Juan Sanabria : Just to a follow-up is just in terms of mall operating hours. Are those back to pre-pandemic levels and if not -- David Simon : Yeah. It is -- yeah. That's a good question. They're inching back toward it, more or less. We may be an hour short on -- excuse me. We may be an hour short on Monday through Wednesday, but basically Thursday, Friday, Saturday we're pretty much back to normal. Juan Sanabria : Is that just a lack of availability of labor issue or is it something else at this point? David Simon : No, it's pretty back to normal. I think that, in some cases, the retailers like it. It's something we're always monitoring and it's -- there is -- it's a very interesting subject because some retailers love it somewhat, more hours to go back. It gives me a headache when I think about all the different opinions. But it's pretty much back to normal, maybe an hour short in the early part of the week. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. David Simon : But it's something -- the important point is something we monitor and manage daily, weekly, in significant consultation with our retailers. And it is -- and it has increased materially since the early days of reopening. Juan Sanabria : Understood. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time -- David Simon : No, go ahead, Operator. Operator : Yeah, at this time, I would like to turn the call over to David Simon for closing remarks, sir? David Simon : All right. Thank you. Have a great rest of your summer and we'll talk soon Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask to please respect the request to limit you to one question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Our cash flow increased to nearly $3 billion year-to-date, consistent with pre -pandemic levels. We recorded increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains, shopper traffic, and retail sales. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and growing, and our various platform investments continue to outperform. Third quarter highlights from funds from operation starts with $1.18 billion or $3.13 per share. Included in the third quarter results were non-cash after-tax gains of $0.30 per share from the contribution of our interest in the Forever 21 and Brooks Brother\u2019s licensing ventures. For additional equity ownership in Authentic Brands Group, we now own approximately 11% of ABG, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.08 per share from the redemption of the $1.65 billion of senior notes.  Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter, our international operations have improved. However, the quarter was below our budget by roughly $0.03 per share, primarily due to various COVID restrictions. Domestic property NOI increased 24.5% year-over-year for the quarter and 8.8% year-to-date.  These growth rates do not include any contribution from the TRG portfolio, or lease settlement income. And if you did include TRG and international properties, our portfolio NOI increased 34.3% for the quarter and 18.7% year-to-date. Occupancy was 92.8%, which was an increase of a 100 basis points compared to the second quarter. Average base rent was $53.91. However, that excludes percentage rent. And if you included that, that would add actually another $7 to BMR. For the first nine months, we signed 3500 leases for 12.8 million square feet, which was nearly 3 million square feet or approximately 800 more deals compared to the first 9 months of 2019. Mall sales for the third quarter were up 11%, compared to third quarter 2019, up 43% year-over-year. Our sales are over 2019 peak levels. These results are impressive, in particular, given lack of international tourism, which we believe will start to increase after the strict restrictions on international travel are lifted beginning next week. Our Company's focus, as you know, is cash flow growth, which should allow us to fund our growth opportunities and increase our dividend.  We would encourage the analytic community to focus on our cash flow and its growth because there are many levers that contribute to it beyond what is contained in 1 or 2 operating metrics. A simplication point, our mathematical open and close spread has declined yet our cash flow has significantly increased. Leasing spreads are calculated at a point in time. We have studied the leasing spread metric across the various retail real estate companies and highlight the following : Spreads are significantly impacted by tenant mix. Our leasing spreads include all openings and closing and is not a same-space measure.  However, we believe many other companies use only this subset for their calculation. We do not include variable lease income in our spread calculations, others do. And there's no consistency in approach. We intend to spend the next several months working to achieve uniformity on this metric, much like we did for sales reporting, although the shopping center sector still does not disclose any sales productivity for its retailers.  Let's keep in mind that all of these metrics, we need to put in perspective and we encourage you to take this opportunity to refocus on the importance of cash flow. We opened our fifth Premium outlet in Korea, and our tenth in Japan is under construction, our redevelopment activities accelerating, and Northgate station opened at Seattle Kraken Community Iceplex.  And we have many developments ongoing at Phipps, King of Prussia , many others. Our share of net cost of development projects is now approaching $1 billion. Our retail investment platforms are performing very well, including SPARC, Penney, and ABG. SPARC outperformed their budgets on sales, gross margins, and EBITDA. And we're very pleased with the JCPenney results. The Penney's team has stabilized the business improved financial results. And we've added private and exclusive national brands to it. Our liquidity position is at $1.5 billion and there's no outstanding balance on their line of credit. And we're very excited to announce, and in fact, his first day is today, Marc Rosen, he's joined the Company as the CEO. He's got a terrific background, great leader, and we look very forward to working with him as he builds on the momentum Penny has established this year. Penny's success is an excellent example of how to better understand our Company. We appointed Stanley Shashoua as the interim CEO for nearly a year ago and look at the results. Much like the variety of our investments, no other Company nor industry has the capabilities to put an executive in an interim role and produce these results. This is a testament, not only to Stanley, but to the Simon culture. TRG is operating above our underwriting, posted also impressive results for cash flow growth occupancy, gains in retail sales, which were 16% higher.  As you know, we amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. We refinanced number of mortgages, and our liquidity stands at $8 billion including 6.9 available on our credit facility the rest in our share of cash. We paid a dividend of $1.50 in September, that was a 7.1% increase sequentially, and 15.4% year-over-year.  Today, we announce our fourth quarter dividend of a $1.65 per share in cash, which is an increase of 10% sequentially, and 27% year-over-year. Dividend will be paid December 31. Now we raised our guidance from $10.70 to $10.80 last quarter to $11.55 to $11.65 per share. This is 85% increase on the midpoint. That's 27% to 28% growth compared to 2020 results, and basically $2 higher than our initial budget this year.  And let me just conclude by saying the following, even though our stock has posted impressive year to date returns, we strongly believe it is still undervalue. Our current multiple of 13 times is approximately 3 turns lower than our historical average and screams very cheap compared to the REIT sector at 24 times, and in many cases, even close to 30.  We have unequivocally proven with our results year-to-date that we've overcome the arbitrary shutdown of our business due to the pandemic and our cash flow has bounced back dramatically, which many had doubted. We have growth leverage beyond our real estate assets that are unique attributes of our Company. We have proven to be astute investors, we have unique business models and diversity of income streams. Our balance sheet is industry-leading and as strong as it's ever been. Our dividend yield is 4.7% and growing, well - covered, higher than the S&P yield of 1.9%, and a REIT average of 2.9%, and we have the potential to perform very well in an inflationary cycle. We're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Rich Hill : Hey, good morning -- or good afternoon, guys. Sorry, it's been a long day. Congrats on another really good quarter, David. I did want to maybe just understand a little bit more about the sequential slowdown on maybe -- in TRG\u2019s domestic portfolio and the international portfolio. Is there anything specifically that would drive that? I'm really only asking the question in terms of how we should think about forward modeling because I do recognize that your guide -- David Simon : No, no, no, you're wrong. It's -- we were just showing our share, so compared to the gross number last quarter. Okay. No, it's a good question, but it's just our share. Rich Hill : Okay. Thank you very much for that clarification. David Simon : Yeah. No, no, no, I'm glad you pointed that out. Thank you. Rich Hill : Got it. And then I did want to maybe just to understand a little bit more about the income from unconsolidated entities. Just to be clear, like last quarter, the non-cash gain was included in that number; is that right? David Simon : Yes. Yeah. Rich Hill : Okay. And then maybe we can just talk about how -- why that number went down a little bit? I do recognize depreciation went up pretty significantly versus the prior quarter. Obviously, seasonality would dictate that the retailers were doing pretty well. Is there anything that we should think about in that number as we look going forward? David Simon : No, it's just -- it's probably most impacted by our European and international business, as I mentioned earlier. Rich Hill : Great. Thanks. That's it from me. Thanks again and congrats on the good quarter. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Great. Thank you. I noticed going from second to third quarter, you increased your total redevelopment about $83 million, the total investment, but that does not include Taubman. Have you started to make any of your investments in terms of Taubman redevelopment? David Simon : Yeah. I mean, it's progressing the way we thought it would. There's a big master planning in the works on Cherry Creek, but that will be several years in the making, but now, there's some good stuff happening in that portfolio as well. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then, how should we think about your retail investments, in terms of quarter-to-quarter, it moves around. Should we look at it on an annual basis, or how should we get a better handle on what you have been able to produce that of your investment in retail? David Simon : Well, I think you should think about it as a Company that can add value to what we invest in, and you should always -- you should never worry about quarter-over-quarter or you should look at annual results and compare them historically. So I'd just say that's generally, but I think where -- I think the most important thing is Craig, we're just a different Company than what most think of us.  I mean, we have lots of avenues for growth and our investments in retailers and other companies has proven to be extremely successful and it will create some variability to quarter-over-quarter but year-after-year, I think, when you look at our return on investment, return on our EBITDA for those businesses; it's actually quite outstanding.  And if you look at the valuations that e-commerce companies are getting for their.com businesses, we've gotten embedded value here that's pretty exciting. So I would never worry about one quarter over another. Craig Schmidt : No. I'm particularly thinking about the 11% interest in APG and what people say that might go for on an IDL. That's very impressive. Thank you. David Simon : Yeah. I mean, I just -- look, we're just not your -- we're more than just an -- even though, we're -- you call us a mall Company, I think we've proven to be beyond that, and that's what I'd encourage you to focus on. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good afternoon, David. It was nice to see the occupancy up 100 basis points sequentially. I am just wondering if you could discuss a little bit about your leasing pipeline and backlog, maybe where you think occupancy ends at the end of this year and what your expectations are for a recovery in occupancy. David Simon : Well, I think it's going to take a little bit of time to get back to where we were pre -pandemic but, I think what's exciting, Steve, is that when we're talking to our folks there -- I was just seeing a tremendous amount of demand. Never been busier. Lots of new retailers, not -- a lots of new users. And I think the action is in our portfolio, so we'll have another increase this quarter upcoming, and then we'll increase our occupancy next year. I don't -- I can't, as you know, we never give specific guidance on that. But the demand, I strongly would tell you that it's -- it's very good. And it's across the board. It's the high-end retailers, it's the value-oriented retailers. We're very pleased with what we're seeing. Steve Sakwa : Great, thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good evening and nice quarter. I guess, maybe just another question on the retailer part of the business. I was wondering if you could go through from a REIT perspective, is there a max how big this business -- how big this can be as a part of your business? And just what's the current goal or ultimate plan for your own brands? Is it just to grow the existing brands, acquire more, and sell it? Just any thoughts on the plans going forward. David Simon : Well, listen, we're obviously very dedicated to being a REIT, and staying a REIT. And all of these businesses are in taxable REIT subsidiary. And you see that in this quarter in particular, you'll see that the big tax expense that is flowing through our P&L. But because we tend to buy these in partnerships, we have really a runway to continue to grow that business. Not to mention that we'd still have our SPAC out there that is a -- in a sense a vehicle for growth. So I'm optimistic that based on our track record, we're going to continue to find other investments whether its retailer, similar situated businesses that will continue that -- add to our unique Company, and we'll take it from there. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think we'll learn more once the 10-Q is out, but until then, just on that tax number in the quarter, could you clarify if that was just related to the retailer income and that taxable REIT subsidiaries, or if there is anything one-time included? Brian Mc Dade : Hey Caitlin, it's Brian. There's actually a one-time $48 million number coming through there from the ABG transaction that we had in the quarter. So you got to bifurcate the 2 numbers. There's a 48 and then the rest is just our normal regular occurring operational tax accrual. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thank you. Brian Mc Dade : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi, please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : Hi, Great. Kenny McConnell (ph) is on with me as well. David, good afternoon. I was wondering if you can maybe go a little bit deeper into the retailer environment in the sense that we know sales are extraordinarily strong as everyone's gotten back out and enjoyed buying things again, but the retailers are struggling a little bit behind -- below the sales line.  They're struggling with staffing. They're struggling with keeping product up to date, most of it launched on ships. So how are you thinking about it from two sides? One, the retailers that you own in dealing with some of these issues, where they're also dealing with their e-comm problems too.  And also from the standpoint of how you think retailers are going to approach the store openings next year, given some of the product, giving some of the staffing concerns and how all that melts together, now that you are more and more sitting on both sides of this equation and really understanding some of these pressure points. David Simon : Well, let me just tackle the backlog in getting product to the stores, which does have an impact on us. You know, just with respect to our tenants. And then as well as the brands that we own. There's variability.  I mean, everyone is pretty comfortable or  -- I should say confident that they're going to get the product in there for the holiday season, but I would tell you that there's no guarantees, so there will be some variability  that we probably would have felt a little bit better going into fourth quarter, but we're cautious on it because we just don't know and it's out of our hands though. I did throw a shout out to Stanley only because by the way, I trained him, but just don't forget that. But he did tell me that he was going to -- if he had to go to the port of LA and unpack boxes to get them into the Penny store, he said he was going to do it. Ad I said, \"Well, that's a great idea, I will do it too. We're on call to help, so that's that. If there is variability, I don't know, but I think generally, people are reasonably confident that they'll get this -- they'll get their product in for time -- for Christmas. Now with respect to employment, this as well beyond retail. Michael Bilerman : Yeah. David Simon : And I mean, it's a -- with all the political back and forth going on, it's really not talked about. And just from a CEO point-of-view and just someone that's worried about growing our overall economy because obviously we are correlated to GDP growth, we've got to figure out whatever is causing the lack of employment growth. We've got to \"Get to the root of it,\u201d because it's not clear to me that there's a big focus on it. And finally getting your last question, Thankfully, Michael, I have not seen it impact folk\u2019s open-to-buy or their growth. Could it? Eventually, the answer is sure, but I -- we have not seen it yet. But the lack of employment is an issue, especially in its -- and some of our retailers are -- they're doing one shift, they're increasing the salaries of the people, there are less part time.  So they're combating it maybe in an a good long-term way because they're raising salaries and getting more loyalty out of that, but the increase in restaurant demand has been phenomenal. And that's the area I worry most about, is just -- ultimately, whether the employment picture could slow that demand -- I don't know, right now, but it's a concern. Michael Bilerman : And so when you throw all this stuff into the pot, you obviously have a lot more earnings and cash flow drivers at timing today that's ever been in your history; does your disclosure -- to be able to get credit and for the Street to value things to the point which you're talking about, your stock being undervalued. Isn't it necessary to breakdown some of these businesses or to give a little bit more information within supplemental so that people can really identify each of these drivers for more operating businesses to the more rent business because there's like little pieces, you have FFF on investments on a traveling 12-month basis in the credit metrics section, it would be really good to get that on a quarterly basis and all those -- are you stepping back?  I know you talked about the lease spreads, but is there an opportunity to revamp disclosure, to give the investment community more of that level of detail overall? David Simon : It's -- we're not going to rule it out. It is our property, domestic property business just to put it in perspective, Michael, is around 80% of our cash flow earnings. However -- FFO, however you want to define it. So then we have the 20% other stuff. And I just worry that if we do get into that, we'll spend more time on the 20%.  Now, 10 years from now it may be different, 5 years from now it could be different, the 80% could be 50%. And then, I agree 100% with your encouragement or point-of-view that it needs to be better articulated. The other option is we could sell our dot-com business for the huge number and -- like some of the others out there, and then you'll ascribe a certain value to it. Believe me, we wouldn't rule that out. Michael Bilerman : You were never in embarking business to begin with. You and I have gone back on that about selling interest in malls. You never wanted to be in the mark. You want to end cash flow and the value. David Simon : I mean, I'm a terrible seller as I have admitted. In any event, I think -- look, I'm excited about what we're doing. I do think it's still -- it's more -- it's a tail wagging the dog, but it's an important tail and it's a beautiful tail and it wags nice and it's very friendly. And as we grow that, I think you're -- I think what you say is certainly appropriate. Michael Bilerman : All right. Thanks. If we have time I'll queue up for a quick guidance on later. David Simon : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good afternoon out there, David. I didn't realize that you and David -- that you and Stanley are both union long shore men able to work on in the LA Long Beach periods, that's pretty impressive. David Simon : Well, we'll do whatever it takes to get product into our stores. Alexander Goldfarb : Well I think if you know that you need that as well. David Simon : You can join us, Alex. You can join us. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, I -- if you didn't work, it's pretty tough work unless you can get to the crane operators, those guys make good money. My question for you, and it sounds like Tom, we get two questions, so I love it. David, it sounds like in your opening comments, you said that you were a little bit behind budget because of some of the COVID closures that you were still experiencing.  Despite that and backing up the ABG intellectual property gain, which is awesome, you guys don't handedly beat. So I know you guys -- I know David, you like to run your career really hard and with -- and do all the fun stuff shout, get your team excited to win.  But still, it's hard to say that you guys were under budget when you beat consensus as much and it sounds, in your answers to Michael on store openings and labor and all different things, it doesn't sound like there really -- any headwinds. It sounds like you guys are just really rebounding strong. So what was the below budget related to as far as -- David Simon : Yes. Alex that was just our international ops. So if I didn't say the word 'international', it's just because I've misread it on the script. I said it. It's just international, it's the only business that I would say is under our initial budget for 2021. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So then just drilling into that international part, what are you seeing? Are you seeing anything like the rebound that we've seen in the U.S. whether it's Asia or Europe, or are the consumer rebound trends very different? David Simon : That's a good question. And I -- and it's by country, in a sense. So there is no simple answer that I would say to you. It's very much how COVID is impacting that country. As you know, Europe was much generally -- in France and Italy, much more stringent on how they open. And as you know, we -- our friends at Klepierre had to deal with almost a -- which, by the way, LA County almost did, but we'd have to enforce whether or not people had vaccine cards to let them in a mall, which thankfully a cooler heads prevailed but it really is a country-by-country.  We're seeing a little bit decent results in the European outlet business and Clay Pears (ph) feeling more confident about what they are seeing. But I would tell you, Asia is generally no, Japan is pretty tough but they have had a pretty strict, shutdown, Korea is doing just fine. I think generally, the U.S. is clearly outperforming. Other -- just from retail sales than other parts of the country -- other parts of the world, I should say. Alexander Goldfarb : And then on your international folks though, are they telling you, \"Yeah, by January 1st, the rest of Asia, Japan, Europe, France, all of the -- all the different countries in Europe. Everyone should be back? \" Or is there just a continued concern that those countries are going to continue to punt on reopening\u2019s and ease of COVID mandates such that '22 is as greatly impacted on the international David Simon : I'm hopeful '22 will be a better year for them, just like '21 was for us. So -- but there will be more proactive gentlemen, I say they, I mean, again, it's country-by-country, but in many spots we'll be more proactive with COVID if COVID spikes. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just a quick David Simon :  restrictions I should say. Alexander Goldfarb : Just a quick question for Brian. On the new line of credit where you switched over from LIBOR to SOFR? The net, end of the day, the economic impact, you guys are still -- are basically paying the same cost for this switchover. You guys are ending up paying a little bit more, maybe it's a little bit less I don't know. David Simon : No, it's a push. It's an economic push that was the whole design, and so forth, Alex. The intent was to be economically neutral. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yeah. I was wondering, outside of the $0.22 of net 3Q one-time items, can you break down which drove the guidance increase for the balance of the year? David Simon : Can you repeat that, Michael? Mike Mueller : You had net $0.22 of one-time items that you called out and guidance went up, I think $0.85 so what drove the other $0.63 or so of the increase, if you could break that down, how much retailer versus domestic ops? David Simon : We don't break that down, but it was a combination of both. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Just checking if you could walk through maybe the quarterly volatility. I know you told Craig not to look at quarterly variances and I apologize for this; but given the movements, it does seem like last quarter, it was reported at share -- this quarter is that share.  And the retailer NOI dipped and the corporate NOI dipped as well, but the guidance went up, so I'm just trying to put these pieces together, maybe get the components for those two NOI pieces, retailer, corporate, and then tying that back to the guidance question that Mike just asked. David Simon : Well, one, you got to remember here, looking at annual numbers here or even quarterly numbers, there were a variety of retailer businesses that we didn't own last year. So that's part of this noise when you looking at it year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter. That's a big piece of this. JCPenney didn't close until year end of last year, which is a big driver of this. So you got a different population, if you would. Juan Sanabria : I'm just focused on sequential because the numbers did go down for -- it seems those two buckets on a share basis, the retailer investments NOI and the corporate, and other NOI s. Brian Mc Dade : Sure. You have just seasonality and timing on the retailer side of it, and then corporate and other, the bigger changes that we recognize as last quarter, a large amounts of termination income. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then just more of a conceptual question on retailing. You guys own different pieces of the retailer landscape you have, the licensing, your traditional -- the licensing, an intellectual property licensing in the traditional retailing.  How do you think of the multiples that you would apply for those or the stickiness of the cash flows. And if you could talk about typical margins. Just trying to get a sense of where the EBITDA is coming from between those two pieces and how you think about those two pieces as well. David Simon : Whereas the EBITDA coming from the retail? Juan Sanabria : Between the licensing and traditional retail, yeah, because you have the ABG Investment which is talking about the licensing business. David Simon : This is the -- well, ABG more or less owns the brands. A lot of brands in the license income. The retailers run the e-commerce and operate stores, so it's essentially like any other retailer and the valuation of those should just be the way you look at any other public Company retailer. I will tell you today, from an EBITDA multiples, retailers reward value to the higher EBITDA multiple than Simon Property Group. Juan Sanabria : And what is a better margin business; do you think the licensing or the traditional retailing? David Simon : Well, the licensing, I mean, it's -- that's a -- licensing business -- are you amortizing the cost of buying the license or not? So the brand -- if you don't -- they have a higher margin, but the gross margins of good retailers are in the 60 plus range. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good afternoon. How are same properties operating expenses trending versus 2019? Are you experiencing any pressure from wage inflation or extra cleaning costs given most of the retailers on a fixed CAM basis. David Simon : Not currently, a. They've got, I think -- we'll see how it impacts '22, but not rising costs from our standpoint in '21 -- shouldn't be all that material. Juan Sanabria : Are you much higher than where you were in '19 or are it kind of adjusted for occupancy changes like margins are more or less the same in your mind or kind of David Simon : Well, other than the drop in occupancy, I think in terms of operating, it's probably pretty similar to '19. Juan Sanabria : And are you thinking about -- go ahead, I'm sorry. David Simon : No, I think that's it. Juan Sanabria : And I was just saying are you thinking about the way CAM is structured any differently now, given the prospect of higher inflation or -- yeah, just curious to get your thoughts there. David Simon : Not really, a. I think the fixed CAM, and obviously it grows in many cases tied to CPI, is just an ease of doing business with the retailer and I don't see that changing. Vince Tibone : Got it. Thank you. Maybe one last quick one for me. Could you just share your latest expectations for domestic property NOI growth from the year? I think the last time you formerly said anything was at 5% at beginning of the year, and I think it's clearly higher from there. David Simon : It's going to be higher, Vince. Vince Tibone : Any number you could throw out there for us? David Simon : Well, now I -- we look at these things on an annual basis, but I'd hate to put a number in. But we're going to be really, based on where we were and what we guided to, we'll -- we should double it, more or less, right? I mean, I think, what do we guide to 4% or something like that? So we should be in that range. Vince Tibone : Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Way to get it out of me Vince, way to go. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your questions. Floris Van Dijkum : Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. I sometimes wonder whether people are not seeing the forest through the trees here. I mean, your guidance for the year is $0.60 over 2022 estimates, right now for consensus, which is -- I suspect those numbers are going to have to come up drastically. Let me get to my question here.  It's about the leasing environment and I'd love to get your color on what you're seeing. Obviously, that you talked about the leasing spreads being negative, and again, those are backwards looking because those deals were negotiated 3 to 6 to 12 months ago, obviously when we are in a different environment. There were many articles written about tenants wanting more turnover, sales, and rent-based structures.  You talked about that in past quarters about offering some of that, but actually as sales now are in excess of 19 levels, comfortably, in excess, apparently, apparently. Are you actually capturing more rent and what do you think that's going to do for your overage rent and also how is that impacting your negotiations with tenants? Do they want to go back to the fixed rents with a smaller turnover base? I'd love to get your thoughts on that. David Simon : Thank you Floris. So I would say -- look, our overage rent is going to be significant this year, but I do want to put -- I want to underline, we still do not have international tourism. So we think there's another -- and I don't believe now, the rules of who can come where and how and whatever, are very confusing. Having -- make my own two international trips, I get confused on what I have to do to go from one place to the next.  But next week there is a lifting of international tourism. We'll see whether it has any impact this year, as I doubt it, but even with overage rent having a very good year this year, we still think that there is another leg up if we get the international tourist that we haven't seen for a couple of 2-3 years, right?  And now, the strengthened dollar may offset that to some extent but we'll see. On your question about lease, this 1, I think some of the folks that wanted to tie their rent too -- and we did it in a select few cases, not a lot. But, yes, they may suddenly think maybe they should do another traditional, go back and do a basic deal.  But by and large, Floris, there's not a lot. I'd say the negotiations about the structure of the lease and overage rent. I call it overage, but overage rent and breakpoints -- it's all pretty -- it's all -- I'd say pretty consistent. So not a huge change in what's going on there. Floris Van Dijkum : And David, maybe if you could touch on the specialty leasing environment as well. Obviously, last year, when a lot of your malls were closed, clearly, you couldn't have much kiosk income. Obviously, billboards -- billboard income is really driven by economic growth. So that, presumably, was very low last year. What do you see? I mean, this is -- could be up to 10% of your NOI. I mean, how do you see that part of the business performing as we head into '22? David Simon : I think we're going to have a very good year in '22 on that side. Because again, there's just a better appreciation for our kind of product and demand is good there. And growing and traffic is still reaching previous levels. So I think they're going to have a very good year this year, but a better year in '22, at least from our initial kind of review of that business plan that we just had recently. Floris Van Dijkum : Great. I mean, maybe if I ask what -- I sort of was asked before, but certainly the backlog of leasing; can you give us any more insight? I know somebody also asked the question about that, but certainly, in terms of what that could mean in terms of occupancy gains in '22 because clearly that's the easy income, if you will, because it all drops down to the bottom line. Any sort of backlog that you're working with right now? Your leasing is busy, and stretched to the max, I would imagine. David Simon : Listen, I always worry they tell me what I want a hear, but what they're telling me, okay? And what I'm seeing in my own -- having to deal with a few retailer space demands, demand is good. So I think -- listen, the world is uncertain as all get out, right? I mean, we all know it's just an -- it's a very interesting time. The last several years and the future are no different. But Floris, the good news is, the demand for our product is good. And our folks are busy, and they're hitting the streets, and making deals. Again, we never give an occupancy number, but I would be very disappointed if we didn't have an uptick in occupancy next year. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks, David. That's it for me. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg Mc Ginnis : David, asking my question a bit differently in terms of back of the napkin math here. So FFO per share guidance appears to be take a slowdown in Q4 versus Q3 after adjusting for the non-cash items. Could you help us understand what items might be impacting those expectations? David Simon : Versus what you were doing or what we're doing? Greg Mc Ginnis : You have 291, Q3, if we take out the non-cash items. And then that kind of assumes 270, 280 in Q4? David Simon : We'll see what we earn. We don't really look at it quarter by quarter. Greg Mc Ginnis : All right. Then maybe shifting gears a little bit to the percent rent leases. First, I'm just trying to understand what portion of leases signed of last year are tied to percent rent deals. How is that compared to history? And then you also mentioned that overage rent will be significant this year, is there going to be seasonality associated with that?  We are just trying to understand if we should expect a sizeable pop in Q1 next year as Christmas sales and associated renter calculated or if it should be smoother throughout the year? David Simon : Well, overage rent does -- is impacted by holiday shopping. So there is some seasonality to it. We don't give out the specifics on what deals are percent versus fixed, though, the -- it's not a very big number. I mean, overwhelmingly a high, high, high percentage of our leases are fixed and sometimes we have unnatural breakpoints which we can get into the mechanics of that later, if you'd like, where we do maybe -- and in COVID, this is -- we did a few -- a handful with some retailers where we may be lowered the fixed, but we got greater upside on sales. But 90 some odd percent of our leases are all fixed rent. And I think I answered your question, unless I missed something. Greg Mc Ginnis : No, you did. So if we think about how leases are getting signed now that we're coming out of COVID, should we expect to see those -- that percent rent number go down and maybe just base rent number start going back up again? David Simon : Well, yeah, on rollover. Sure, over time. Again, it's a function of when leases expire. Greg Mc Ginnis : All right. Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, David. Good evening. David Simon : How are you? Haendel St. Juste: So you mentioned earlier the stock being cheap 13 times FFO, I get it. And you point out your long-term average, but I guess the 1 missing piece we haven't seen is the asset value clarity. I guess, I'm curious where you peg a mall cap rates today, was there anything in your recent mall refinancing and negotiation that was informative about how the lending community is viewing mall values and how would you characterize the market appetite for mall refinancing\u2019s today? Thanks. David Simon : Good. I think we did -- how many financing did we do? Brian Mc Dade : It's probably -- that's 22 this year, almost $30 billion. The market is open from a refinancing perspective in supportive of high-quality assets. David Simon : Look, I think, we're -- I'd say where A assets, there's -- I mean, I have discussed this before and not to bore you, but there's not a lot of buyers, and sellers realized how valuable they are, and they want a really low cap rate. There's no A asset in this country, that would sell for anything above a five cap rate. My opinion -- in my humble opinion. Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate that. I was looking also if there's anything from the other side that you could share from how the lenders are valuing or any variant? David Simon : I thought you were an equity analyst. Why do you care about lenders? Haendel St. Juste: Well, there's a value with the loan is described to. David Simon : Exactly. I mean, look, they're -- they look at debt yield. Brian Mc Dade : Debt yield in cash flow cover deal is the metrics that they're using more and more importantly, David Simon : And sponsorship to our resource. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Well, I guess I'll move on to my next question. Thank you though. One last about the pricing and demand for your JCPenney boxes. Anything you could share on that? Thanks. David Simon : Well, the ones that we own, we're not selling because Penney is performing terrifically well. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thanks. Tom Ward : Alex, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. David Simon : Sure. Linda Tsai : In terms of the $7 of variable rents that weren't included in the base minimum rent. When would you expect to see improvement in that number and how much of that -- those $7 could be moved to fix? David Simon : You mean improvement or just when it goes too fixed essentially, right? Linda Tsai : Well, I guess, 2 separate questions. When it goes too fixed and then when would we see an overall improvement in base minimum rent given the moving pieces? David Simon : Well, it's lease by lease to build that number up. I mean, demand is picking up, so we're focused on driving our cash flow. But again, as I -- maybe you missed my -- it wasn't overly compelling, but you missed my opening remarks. In that I would recommend again, I know -- I'd recommend you just look at the cash flow of the Company and not overly worry about a metric here or there. It just -- it all manifests itself in the cash.  In terms of when that will end up in base rent is really, as I said earlier, is just going to be functional when that particular resource, when it expires. And traditionally, when that does, we're usually pretty effective of trying to garner as much of that overage rent or that percentage rent above the break-point back into the base rent. Linda Tsai : Got it. And then store closures are way down from prior years and given the importance of holiday to retailers but also challenges around supply chain, do you think this is potentially a threat to some of the smaller lower credit retailers? David Simon : I don't think so. And honestly the credit profile of the retail community is not bad. I mean, there's always going to be a few out there, but I would say generally the credit profile is pretty -- not going to look pretty good. So the retailers are always pruning the portfolio and so on. But I don't think the supply chain is going to cause -- it might unfortunately cause a local mom and pop some stress but I don't think it will cause it a regional or bigger chain, financial calamity. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to David Simon for closing remarks. David Simon : All right. Thank you and appreciate all the questions. We'll talk soon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect the request to limit yourself to one question. I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : We had a very busy and productive quarter to end a very successful year. We recorded occupancy gains, record retail sales, and demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is robust, and our other platform investments had strong results. We generated nearly $4.5 billion in funds from operation in \u201821 or $11.94 per share. The $4.5 billion is a record amount for our Company for the year, and coming off a difficult year of 2020, these results are a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, smart investments coupled with coherent strategy. Fourth quarter funds from operations were $1.16 billion or $3.09 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net loss of $0.10 per share from a loss on extinguishment of debt and a write-off of predevelopment cost, partially offset by an after-tax gain on the sale of equity interest. Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter to conclude the year. Our international operations improved in the quarter. Domestic property NOI increased 22.4% year-over-year -- I\u2019m sorry, for the quarter, and 12% for the year, including our share of NOI from TRG and our international properties. Portfolio NOI increased 33.6% for the quarter and 22.3% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 93.4%, an increase sequentially of 60 basis points and 260 basis points year-over-year. Average base minimum rent was $53.91, add $8 to that if you included variable rent. For the year, we signed more than 4,100 leases for a total of more than 15 million square feet. This was the highest amount of leasing activity we have done over the last six years. Retail sales reported -- retail sales continued in the fourth quarter. Mall sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and up 34% year-over-year. Reported retail sales per square foot reached a record level for 2021 at $713 per foot for our mall and outlet business and $645 for the mills. These results obviously are impressive, particularly given the lack of international tourism for \u201821. Occupancy costs at the end of 2021 are the lowest they\u2019ve been in five years at 12.6% year-end. We opened two new developments in 2021, one in the UK and a premium outlet in South Korea. Construction continues on our tenth outlet in Japan, opening this fall and Normandie, France opening in the spring of \u201823. We completed five significant redevelopments. We added densification components with the opening of two hotels and the completion of an NHL headquarters and practice facility. Progress continues on the densification of Phipps Plaza which will open this fall. We have a significant pipeline of redevelopment projects, which will be funded from our internally generated cash flow. Let me turn to our other platform investments, they produced terrific results in 2021, namely JCPenney, SPARC, ABG, and RGG, which is Rue Gilt Groupe. JCPenney\u2019s results were impressive. Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.6 billion. Company delevered their balance sheet, has no borrowings on their line of credit. CEO, Marc Rosen strengthened his management team with a new CIO and Chief Digital Officer. RGG, including our Shop Premium Outlet marketplace growth continues, and we expect continued investment in 2022 to drive customer acquisition and sales growth. SPARC Group will be the operating partner for Reebok in the U.S. There\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for SPARC to develop sportswear and footwear expertise. The Reebok integration will require additional investment by SPARC as it expands its capability and reach. TRG, Taubman Realty Group, which we own 80%, posted great operating metrics and results, which also beat our underwriting. Reported retail sales was $942 per square foot, a 31% increase year-over-year. Occupancy also increased 210 basis points for the year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We\u2019ve been active in the debt markets. We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with lower pricing grid for five years. We issued $2.75 billion of senior notes \u20ac750 million notes, completed the refinancing of 25 property mortgages for a total of $3.3 billion at an average interest rate of 3.14%. We paid more than $4 billion in debt and delevered by $1.5 billion. And with the recent January notes offering, our liquidity stands at $8 billion. Now, just to turn to dividend, we paid out $2.7 billion in cash common stock dividends last year. Today, we announced a dividend of $1.65 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 27%. This dividend is payable on March 31. Now, just to go through guidance for 2022. Our FFO guidance is $11.50 to $11.70 per share. When looking at our \u201822 FFO guidance, it is important to note the following items as compared to \u201821 actual results. Approximately $0.32 per share gain related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Kl\u00e9pierre, approximately $0.32 per share in gains related to our investment in authentic brands. These gains were partially offset by approximately $0.14 per share in debt extinguishment charges, resulting in an adjusted FFO of $11.44 per share for \u201821. \u201821 also included significant increase in overage and percentage rent compared to prior years and lease settlement income of approximately $0.10 higher than historical average. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions : domestic property NOI growth of up to 2%, approximately $0.15 to $0.20 drag on FFO from additional investments in RGG, and SPO, JCPenney and the Reebok integration cost at SPARC all to fund future growth, the impact of a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to \u201821 levels, and continued muted international tourism, no significant acquisition, or disposition activity. Finally, I really want to thank the entire Simon team for their tireless work that they continue to do for our retailers, shoppers, and communities every day and for bouncing back in \u201821 after a very difficult 2020. Make no mistake about it, \u201821 was a great year. And I think -- Tom knows, but I think our FFO guidance was -- which was consistent with basically the analytic community around $9.60 per share, and we reported $11.94 per share. So, that\u2019s a heck of a year. I\u2019m very excited about our plans for \u201822 and the future growth prospects of our Company, and we\u2019re ready for any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks for the detail or at least the additional disclosure on the guidance. I guess, just sort of tying back to the leasing comment you made about the 15 million feet being kind of a record year for the last six years, you know what are your expectations for leasing activity in \u201822? And how that might tie into further occupancy gains? And then, I also noticed that the leasing spread information that you used to provide in the supplemental wasn\u2019t there anymore. And I was just wondering if you could comment on kind of pricing trends that you\u2019re seeing. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. So, I think we\u2019re very optimistic, Steve, about \u201822 leasing. A lot of new business with a lot of new tenants is the goal. We expect to increase occupancy compared to year-end \u201821. And obviously, the last couple of years with COVID, we\u2019ve been -- obviously been working with our retailers. So, we haven\u2019t quite had the level of pricing power that we\u2019d like to see. We\u2019re starting to see that strengthen from our standpoint and we\u2019re still looking for win-wins between us and our clients. But we feel better that we\u2019ll continue to drive rental growth over time. And as you know, we took a bet that the world in bricks and mortar was not going to end. So, we -- when we did deal with a lot of renegotiations that came about because of COVID, we got -- we try to make it back on sales because we believed in our business. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to look at that what we\u2019re achieving on either percentage or overage rent, which historically we haven\u2019t taken into account in our spreads, and one of the reasons why we have done away with the spreads and the fact that there\u2019s no industry uniformity. And more importantly, there\u2019s very few retail real estate companies that are doing it. But, we bet on our company. We made the right bet. It produced the results that we wanted to see in \u201821, frankly above our expectations. And the strength of our portfolio and the demand is there. So, now, we just got to execute it. I do think there\u2019s so much going on that I\u2019d be remiss not to say it still takes a while to get stores open. And with all the activity, we\u2019ll see some of that in \u201822, but we\u2019re going to see a tremendous amount of great new stores in the \u201823 time period. Operator : Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Maybe just a question on the guidance and the retailer contribution part. David, I know that you mentioned the \u201822 guide includes the $0.15 to $0.20 drag from additional investments this year. I guess, I was wondering if you could just go through kind of what contribution the retailers had in \u201821. What the guidance assumes for \u201822? And any more kind of background you can give on what\u2019s causing that drag? Realize that it\u2019s for future growth but what the impact in \u201822 is and what\u2019s specifically driving it? David Simon : Yes. I mean, the drag is all about future investments. So, we outlined a little bit on the call, but we\u2019re in a growth mode with Rue La La Gilt and shoppremiumoutlets.com. So, we\u2019re acquiring customers. We\u2019re marketing more, and we\u2019re building the technology out to serve those three platforms with great sales growth and marketplace growth, but that takes investment. So, that\u2019s one element of it. The second element of it is, as you know, JCPenney is building out its beauty business as well as its digital business. So again, it\u2019s the belief in the brand that\u2019s going to -- that is going to create these unique opportunities, and we\u2019re going to invest in doing that. And then, finally, the bigger -- the Reebok integration will reduce the operating earnings from SPARC just temporarily in \u201802 as it deals with consolidating its operation. We now have an office, deal hasn\u2019t closed yet. It\u2019s going to close at the end of the month. We have excess real estate. So, we have to work through all of that. But the return for \u201823 on that will be much more than whatever the investment is. So, all of these have -- the payback on RGG stuff is 16 months. They track it -- they track it by the nickel, penny the same. I mean, very similar to previous businesses. But you got to invest for future growth. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. In terms of operational outside of that, Caitlin, we\u2019re basically more or less budgeting the same EBITDA, NOI levels for our investments, our other platform investments other than these investments that I just mentioned. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. And just one quick thing. You mentioned the Reebok integration will reduce SPARC earnings in \u201802. Did you mean Q2? David Simon : I meant \u201822. I\u2019m sorry. \u201822. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : I want to talk about the dividend for a moment. You\u2019ve raised it for three consecutive times. I think we\u2019ve discussed in the past that it\u2019s well below where you were in 2019, despite free cash flow being similar to where you were in 2019. Can you maybe just elaborate on why not increase the dividend more here? I recognize in the previous answer, you were talking about in growth mode and investing in businesses, but is there a trajectory to get back up to $8.30 where you were, I think, prior to COVID? David Simon : Yes. I mean, again, it would be my expectation over time that we\u2019ll reach those levels. I think it\u2019s just an abundance of caution. But if you look at Q-over-Q, it\u2019s a 27% increase. So I know sequentially, it\u2019s not. But that\u2019s what we tend to do historically is we tend to be flat in the Q1 area. We measure our taxable income. And as earnings percolate, we tend to raise with our taxable income. So, I think we\u2019re really adopting what we\u2019ve done historically. But our payout ratio is low. Our liquidity is strong. And I would expect hopefully that our dividend, we\u2019ll continue to see the increases. Now, there was a dramatic increase from \u201820 to \u201821. So, I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll continue a very positive trend. Rich Hill : And just one more question. If I think back to this time last year, you guided to -- initially guided to 950 to 975. You put up a really healthy number this year where I hope we see it 11.36 ex the one-timers you mentioned. I\u2019m not sure if we see eye to eye on that, but that\u2019s pretty close. Is there -- what would give us -- what would you give you any confidence that this could -- that 2022 could surprise to the upside just like 2021, or do you view this year as more baked, so to speak than 2021? David Simon : Well, the years never bake, right? So look, I think the big variable that is always there is basically sales because we still have because we still have some COVID oriented leases that have not rolled over that we still are a little more dependent on sales than we would have said 3, 4 years ago. So that is why we\u2019re a little more cautious because we don\u2019t -- I\u2019d like to say we\u2019re as good as we are. We\u2019re not -- we can\u2019t predict with certainty sales. But -- so I think -- I\u2019m hopeful that the -- when we talk to retailers, they still feel very good about the economy and what\u2019s going on. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of volatility in the world today. And we\u2019re not immune to that. So, we just have to wait and see. But we are building off a terrific, terrific \u201821. So, we\u2019ll see -- I am hopeful that we\u2019ll continue to produce growth assuming the -- everything holds together externally with our economy and so on. So, there\u2019s no certainty, but I feel pretty good about where we stand. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : David, I wanted to come back to sort of the growth that you\u2019re getting from a lot of these unique and differentiated investments that you\u2019re making? And just sort of how it ties back to this year\u2019s earnings forecast, but also that growth in the future. You gave us a couple of pieces, but they\u2019re all a little bit different the time of all together. So, I\u2019m just going to use one for now and maybe we can pivot off of that. But if you just look at your FFO from investments, which is on page 29 of the sup, which I recognize includes Kl\u00e9pierre, but it includes -- sorry, page 28, but includes all of these other investments that you\u2019re making. You\u2019re looking at 2021 at about $550 million, about $1.46. You\u2019ve now thrown out for this coming year, the $0.15 to $0.20 drag from these investments that are being made. And I\u2019m just trying to reconcile well how much is in the $11.60 a share for all of these, which are both retailer investments as well as Kl\u00e9pierre, what sort of range are we thinking about that\u2019s obviously gross, but then netted down by, I guess, $0.15 to $0.20 for these other investments. I\u2019m just trying to put it all together. David Simon : Well, I mean, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. But we really did not hear you well. But just to clarify what we did pick up. The NOI from investments is only Kl\u00e9pierre, and it includes our small interest in HPS, which is de minimis. Other platform or investment -- okay -- the other NOI from other platform investments would include RGG, SPARC, JCPenney or share of ABG. So, that\u2019s that line just to clarify. I did hear that. Guys, did you hear question? Tom Ward : I didn\u2019t hear past that. David Simon : Okay. Does that help you? Michael Bilerman : No. Let me -- I\u2019ll try to be clear, David. David Simon : Michael, if you went back to the office. Michael Bilerman : I\u2019m in the office, David\u2026 David Simon : You might be able to sound a little clearer, okay? So, I don\u2019t know, maybe you can -- I\u2019m happy if you text this or read it out loud, and we cannot hear you. Michael Bilerman : Well, I\u2019m in the office. How about if I pick up my phone. Is that better for you, David? David Simon : Slightly, yes. Michael Bilerman : All right. Well, I\u2019ll take slightly. But I\u2019m just trying to get, on page 28, you actually list the FFO contribution, right? $550 million from everything, right? $1.46. So, I\u2019m just trying to triangulate what you earned in \u201821 and how that compares to the $11.60 million in \u201822. You\u2019ve given us a couple of nuggets of information, the $0.15 to $0.20 drag, but it doesn\u2019t net out to actually what\u2019s in guidance for these investments. David Simon : Well, again, the tax effect of that, let\u2019s -- there\u2019s no surprise. Our math is very simple. I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ve made money in all these investments. Now you have to pay attention to it. Unlike other people that make investments and lose money. We actually make investments that make money. These are the NOI. They\u2019re not -- the tax line is below this. This is just kind of -- this is like an EBITDA number that we try to show the market. That\u2019s all that this is, and it\u2019s there for your information. And again, the NOI from other platforms, I described, the NOI from investments is Kl\u00e9pierre and HBS and we footnote corporate and other NOI sources. So I don\u2019t know what else -- the guys are happy to take the question offline. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Yes, I was looking at page 28, not the NOI page. That\u2019s where the confusion was coming from David. Maybe just -- we see the FFO with investments, right? So that includes all of the FFO from all these great investments you\u2019re making. And this is not a negative question, David, but this is a positive of stuff that you\u2019re doing. David Simon : Yes. That includes everything lumped together and then take the tax impact. And again, it\u2019s NOI, so it\u2019s pre-interest, then obviously, FFO is not. But we\u2019re happy to walk you through. Michael Bilerman : Well, that\u2019s exactly -- now we\u2019ve gotten to the question, which is that\u2019s why -- that\u2019s the number we do know, right? So, there\u2019s no ambiguity. David Simon : It\u2019s EBIT. So remember, retailers have depreciation that we don\u2019t add back and so on and so forth. But the guys will be happy to walk you through it. Tom Ward : We\u2019ll connect offline, Michael. Michael Bilerman : Okay. David, can you just talk generally? Your opening comment and the press release was all about unlocking value, and you\u2019ve already done some of that through the transactions. How do you think about the initiatives that you want to focus on this year and what value is sitting in this platform for Simon shareholders? David Simon : Well, I mean, given our level of cash investment, if you were to look at it on a private equity basis, right, we\u2019ve made 20x on our investments. And they\u2019re continuing to grow. And SPARC, I think, is a good example on RGG, have great platforms that can continue to be a leader in their business. And ultimately, the market we\u2019ll see if we need to at some point in time, monetize these or highlight the value, but it\u2019s embedded here at multiples that the market is ascribing to us, but frankly, the external market is probably valuing it more than what it is today. Michael Bilerman : Right. And that\u2019s where all the questions that I\u2019m asking, David, these are positive things that you\u2019ve done that we get asked by the investment community of trying to ask for more disclosure to try to get to ascribe that value that you want. So that\u2019s -- it\u2019s coming from a good place. And usually, I\u2019m good at math, but... David Simon : I never suggested you aren\u2019t. I\u2019m just having a hard time hearing you. That was the only negative comment. Okay. So, sorry about that. But again, we\u2019re happy to walk you through it. So, it can help you understand what we\u2019re doing. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : So, I\u2019ll abandon the retail investment question for now. But now in 4Q \u201819, pre-pandemic David, the redev pipeline was $1.8 billion at its peak. Now, it\u2019s $944 million in 4Q. And that\u2019s just a really modest increase from 3Q. So, as you talk about record FFO and very healthy cash flow, how are you looking at capital allocation priorities going forward? Should we expect ramping redevelopment, some transformational, clearly some more retailer investments, dividends, buybacks? You mentioned no acquisitions. How do you view the priorities here? David Simon : Well, the good news is our pipeline is kind of back to where it was in \u201819. However, remember, in \u201819, we finished some stuff, right? So naturally, that falls off. And then, we didn\u2019t add anything really until this year. But I think you\u2019ll see steady progress in adding -- and remember, we only add when we start construction on a project or we internally to prove it or we\u2019re about to. So, we would expect to be able to add to that number this year. So, you\u2019ll see that. I\u2019d be disappointed if it didn\u2019t grow in size and stature, and mostly in mixed use. So, we still -- I would still say that\u2019s the number one priority, we\u2019re going to invest in our existing platforms that we have, whether they\u2019re SPARC or ABG or RGG. So, those are businesses that we have a lot of faith in, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in those. We\u2019re still doing a lot of investment kind of in the -- in updating the technology aspects of our shopping centers that we\u2019ll continue to do. That\u2019s important to us. We expect to raise the dividend. We\u2019ve been really quiet on the acquisition front, and that\u2019s like -- that\u2019s perfectly fine with us. We\u2019ll see how the market transpires, but we have no real we feel really good about our portfolio. And if there\u2019s something that fits in nicely, reasonably priced, we\u2019ll take a look at it, but if not, c\u2019est la vie. And then I think we\u2019re going to build another platform. It\u2019s not necessarily a retail platform, but we\u2019re in the midst of kind of working through some opportunities. Stay tuned. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alex Goldfarb : Hey David. I\u2019m torn because you guys had one question first, so I have two. But I\u2019m going to restrain myself and just ask one, unless Tom gives me the go ahead. I\u2019m going to go back to the retailer question. You guys made a lot of headway on your brands. You added $160 million of NOI, EBITDA, whatever you want to call it, from the retailer platform last year. And you guys seem to have a pretty quick turnaround of the brands. So one, does it surprise you how quickly these brands have turned around, given that there are a number of -- we won\u2019t mention retailers, but brands out there, retailers who have been trying to restructure for years and haven\u2019t been successful whereas in short order you guys have? And two, does this give you a better insight into your tenant negotiations such that now you have much more informed view of when you\u2019re in negotiations with the tenants what their true potential is versus what they may be telling you at the table? David Simon : Yes. So, on the fast turnaround, I would say, yes. But remember, we bought these in bankruptcy, which most of them in bankruptcy. So, that allows you to clear out a lot of the issues and gives you a kind of a clean slate to grow from. I\u2019d say that the management team that we put together at SPARC is excellent. They know how to integrate. And between our oversight from ABG and SPG, we\u2019ve got good formula that\u2019s working. Their performance has absolutely no relevance or insight at all when it comes to our negotiation or our insight into how to deal with retailers. So that\u2019s just a flat out. No, Alex. I could see how you might ask that question, but it really doesn\u2019t -- because each brand is there is unique and they don\u2019t necessarily have a direct competitor that would be helpful, and we just don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t think like that because, as you know, every space and every mall is different and market rents are all over the place. So, simple answer to that is no. Alex Goldfarb : Okay. And Tom, will you allow me a second, or are there a lot of questions, you got to move on? David Simon : He\u2019s got a puppy dog look toward me. So, based on that, we will allow you. Thank you. Go ahead. Alex Goldfarb : So, big picture. Obviously, a lot of what\u2019s going on in retail and the crime and all these headlines is out there. My question for you is, is your sense from talking to the industry and obviously talking to local officials, is the view that it\u2019s on the industry to try and beef up security and solve this, or do you sense that the local authorities are finally realizing they need to do more from their end? David Simon : Well, look, I think we are top notch in this area, though, unfortunately, as good as we are, we cannot avoid what\u2019s happened. So, we\u2019re all subject to this. I think it -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an industry issue. I think it\u2019s a local jurisdiction issue. And it\u2019s a nationwide issue. And I believe the tide is turning. We are all over this, the safety of our consumers and obviously, the retailers is priority number 1. We\u2019re not immune to it as much as we would like to be. We have a very sophisticated operations center, intelligent center that deals with this. If you ask the retailers, they would tell you that I think, Alex, that we\u2019re number 1 in this area, but we\u2019re not immune. I would love to be immune. But we, as a nation, have to address this, and it\u2019s happening, obviously, in a lot of different areas. I don\u2019t want to get into politics at all. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think the industry can solve it. I do think it\u2019s got to be at the local and national level. And I do think we\u2019ve got to hold everyone accountable that this kind of stuff cannot be tolerated. But believe me, we are all over it but where we -- some of these things are just impossible to avoid. However, what you don\u2019t hear from us, Alex, is all the ones that we forwarded, [ph] dozens and dozens of multiple ones, and we do an excellent job, but it\u2019s -- we\u2019re we have to deal with some unfortunate consequences of these acts. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just hoping to ask a little bit about rents and leasing spreads again. So, the base rent was flat sequentially at just under $54. Do you think that\u2019s now bottomed or stabilized, and it\u2019s headed upwards from here? And on the re-leasing spreads, I think you talked $8 about being in the number for the deals maybe signed in the fourth quarter or at quarter end, not quite sure there. But, when will that translate into the baseline rent? When will that kind of sunset out? And how are you guys thinking about internally on that spread number that\u2019s no longer disclosed? Like what\u2019s the expectation for what you generated in \u201821 and what your expectation is for \u201822? David Simon : Well, we -- first of all, we focus on NOI growth. So, that\u2019s number one, and we expect to have NOI growth. So that\u2019s the first. I\u2019d say to you -- I think you\u2019re not -- maybe we weren\u2019t clear, but the $54 is somewhat -- it\u2019s just the base minimum rent that our portfolio averages. It does not include overage or percentage rent. If you included that based on \u201821 results, that $54 would be $62. Okay? So, that\u2019s the that relationship there. And I don\u2019t -- I try to listen carefully to your question, but it just goes to show that the $54 is missing this component, and we thought it was material enough to point it out. Juan Sanabria : And so, when do you think that $8 comes into the number 1. Does that $8 -- that\u2019s $8 assumption? David Simon : Yes. That\u2019s all a function of lease expiration. So, we tend to raise -- if someone is an overage rent or they have a percent rent deal that\u2019s expiring, we try to raise the base minimum rent or we try to capture as much in the base minimum rent from the overage that\u2019s generated. You don\u2019t always get all of it, but you do some of it. So, it\u2019s -- it should pick up over time, but it\u2019s really a function of the big overage rent payers and when their leases expire. Operator : Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Floris Van Dijkum : David, you just mentioned NOI growth. And obviously, you know that I\u2019ve been -- I still think there\u2019s a lot of value in the business here. But again, you might be slightly joking... David Simon : By the way, so do I. So do I, Floris. Okay? Floris Van Dijkum : No, no. I know you think there\u2019s a lot of value. And I\u2019m trying to help you get that out. But the -- walk me again -- the 2% NOI growth that you have in your assumptions for \u201822. If you have your -- basically, you have fixed bumps in your leases typically of around 3%. You don\u2019t get it for all of them, but you\u2019re a little bit shy of 3% maybe. But all things set or spare, but everything else stays, the same occupancy stays the same. You should get around 2.5% to 3% NOI growth. Yet you\u2019re only guiding for 2% growth. David Simon : Yes. I think it\u2019s very simple. The real simple answer is sales, and we do a very sophisticated model. If we have sales levels that are above this year, we will overachieve that number. But again, we\u2019re in February, and we tend to be -- try to be cautious on that number. But that\u2019s really -- and then, there are increases in cost that we\u2019re dealing with as well for us. So for instance, I mean, security expenses are up based on -- we just had a discussion with Alex on that. Obviously, we have wage inflation janitorial. So, we have pressures on expenses just like everybody else. We\u2019ve got no break on the real estate tax front from the local municipalities, even though we were closed for months in many cases in \u201820 -- \u201819 and \u201820. But our real estate tax expense keeps going up. So, we have pressures there that we\u2019re just trying to be relatively thoughtful about how to deal with. And then, the percent overage sales number going into every year is a little bit of the unknown, and we\u2019re trying to bake some conservatism into that thought process. Floris Van Dijkum : So David, I mean, just again -- but a lot of your costs would be recaptured through CAM. You\u2019ve got fixed CAM that increases at inflation. So that would imply that you\u2019re fixed CAM... David Simon : No, no, no. We don\u2019t have CPI adjusted. Floris Van Dijkum : That\u2019s right. You have 3% bumps. You have 3% bumps. You\u2019re right. David Simon : Yes. And we have bumps. But if it goes up 6% and we\u2019re going up 3%, we lose 3%. So -- and -- so again, I mean, it\u2019s all factored in. But I would say there\u2019s a little bit of margin pressure. And again, hopefully, I\u2019ve been clear on the sales front. Floris Van Dijkum : So David, so maybe if you can touch on one little area, which I looked at in your release, you have 6.8 million square feet of leases that are longer than a year, but that are sort of temporary tenants, specialty leasing, which are at an average rent of around -- off the top of my head, $17. It\u2019s 10% of your small shop portfolio that is at a third your average rent that you\u2019re getting. What happens when those leases go to market or become full tenants? Theoretically, they should go up by 300%. Is that the right way to look at it? David Simon : Yes. Look, I think that\u2019s a great opportunity for our company. We did a very good job. It\u2019s kind of a flex business. We\u2019re still under occupied. We still have a number of tenants like that that are important to the community, but as more permanent tenants come to the market. That\u2019s a great opportunity for the Company. Floris, this is a real interesting thing. A lot of that stuff is happening now. So, think about it this way. In \u201821 -- in \u201820, we got decimated by COVID, right? We came back unbelievably strong in \u201821, much better than anyone would have predicted and reinforce our business model. I would venture to say. But we still have we still have a lot of short-term leasing or what I\u2019ll call specialty leasing. But that as we re-lease that space, that comes in midstream, that comes in first quarter, second quarter, third quarter of \u201822 because, as remember, our retail base, a lot of it sat on the sidelines, all of \u201820, and didn\u2019t really start opening up open to buy in \u201821. And by the time you build out a store in a mall, it\u2019s a six to nine-month process. So, as much given where we are today, I would say to you, and we never -- like this is solely anti the way I think. But we still have a transition year in \u201822. But it\u2019s not an excuse. I\u2019ve never used that as an excuse. But believe me, as we continue to lease up to permanent retailers away from specialty, we\u2019re going to generate more income, but it\u2019s not all going to fall in \u201822. Now, did I explain myself well, guys? Would you add to it? Okay. So, sometimes I\u2019m inarticulate. So I mean -- and again, that\u2019s not an excuse, but that\u2019s how -- but \u201822 is going to be -- continue to be a transition year like \u201821 was, but we kicked the crap out of \u201821. It was an unbelievable year. Spectacular based on where we were. Okay, Floris? Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: David, I\u2019ve got a question on OCR. You mentioned OCRs earlier, something we haven\u2019t talked about in a while. And at 12.6%, you mentioned that\u2019s the highest level in five years. I guess I\u2019m curious how important is OCR today in tenant conversations? Are they willing to pay or even consider some of these look back OCRs? And any color on where you think that OCRs might go near term, or do we ever get kind of back to the mid to upper teen levels? Thanks. David Simon : Yes. Look, I think it reflects an earlier comment, which is we are starting to see a little more pricing power as demand goes up and the fact that the overall business is better. So, it\u2019s a good insurance policy and that the retailers are producing very positive results in our portfolio. We don\u2019t want to put them on the edge, but we\u2019ve taken our lumps over the last few years. And now we\u2019re just trying to balance it a little bit better than what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. So, it\u2019s a good indicator that we\u2019ve got some room to go. That\u2019s all it is. Haendel St. Juste: And if I could follow up. I don\u2019t know if you mentioned it earlier, or if you\u2019re willing to share. Are you still doing any of those shorter-term leases that you were doing during COVID with the lower upfront rent threshold, but with the lower percentage rent thresholds, so you can make out in the event of improving sales, or is that in the event of the past now? David Simon : It\u2019s essentially a thing in the past, though, there\u2019s always a case here or there where we might -- we might have a deal in \u201823 for space, but they\u2019re not ready -- I\u2019m sorry, they\u2019re not ready in \u201823. So we have a retailer in the space. So, \u201822 might be an extension of that while we finalize the lease for \u201823. And that\u2019s a little bit what I was talking about with Floris as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Vince Tibone : I wanted to follow up on Floris\u2019 question. I believe you mentioned that if sales -- tenant sales repeated 2021 levels, you would likely exceed the 2% guidance for domestic property NOI. I just want to get a better understanding of maybe what sales levels you have baked into current guidance. And it would seem that your -- the base case is actually a decline in sales compared to last year. So, trying to just get a little more color there would be helpful. David Simon : Well, we do it -- we really do it -- I don\u2019t know why, but we do do it tenant by tenant. And I do -- simple thing is if we do see sales above this year, we would hopefully -- putting aside the comment about rising expense cost, if you kept our expenses flat, we would see a better, more robust NOI -- portfolio NOI growth. Simple answer is that. And we do have some baked in conservatism in that number. But again, it\u2019s -- we do this budgeting process late in the year. Actually, some people, they do it earlier than I\u2019d like, but we -- it\u2019s always -- in the case of sales, it\u2019s an art versus a science. The good news, though, when we talk to retailers, they are planning up sales compared to \u201821, okay? And that\u2019s positive. And if they produce their own plan, we\u2019ll see the benefit of that. Vince Tibone : So, is it fair to say that you\u2019re forecasting sales to be negative? Maybe that\u2019s the base case of guidance, or am I misreading into that? David Simon : I would say around the 2% level, it\u2019s relatively flat. Vince Tibone : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If I could maybe try to squeeze one more quick one in there. I\u2019m just curious for like the overed rent component. How much was overed rents in terms of total lease income? Like what percentage was that for this last year? David Simon : We don\u2019t give that out, but if we do -- well, I\u2019ll ask the guys if they want to give it out. We tend not to do that. But I would say it was similar to what we would use to see from when we had big international tourism in our big international properties from a percent point of view. Okay? Guys, is that right? Okay. And then, it really went away. So, it\u2019s kind of back to where we were maybe 4, 5, 6 years ago. Tom Ward : Hector, we have time for one more question? Operator : Okay. Our final question comes from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Mike Mueller : Hi. A quick one. Rent per square foot was lower year-over-year in the malls outlets, but it was higher in the mills. And curious what\u2019s driving that dynamic. David Simon : I\u2019m sorry. Could you repeat? I didn\u2019t -- you broke up there for a second. Mike Mueller : Yes. Your rent per square foot for malls and outlets is down year-over-year, but for the mills that\u2019s up year-over-year. David Simon : Yes. In the mills, they include all of the boxes. We include all the boxes. I shouldn\u2019t say that. We include all the boxes. So, every square footage. It\u2019s not whereas in the outlet mall, it\u2019s basically just the interior space, that\u2019s the department store. So, that\u2019s -- so they have a few big tenants that may be driving the increase. But that business has been very healthy, and we\u2019re very pleased with the results there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon, Chairman, for closing remarks. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. I know there\u2019s a few that are still looking to get some questions answered. So, Brian and Tom will be available, of course, I am as well. And thanks for participating in the call today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : I\u2019m pleased to report our first quarter results. First quarter funds from operations were $1.046 billion or $2.78 per share prior to a non-cash unrealized loss of $0.08 from a mark-to-market in fair value of publicly held securities. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter, despite being negatively impacted from the surging U.S. dollar. We are also very pleased with the results from our other platform investments. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. Domestic property NOI increased 7.5% year-over-year for the quarter and our international properties as I mentioned performed well, driving portfolio NOI growth to 8.8% occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 93.3%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year and a decrease of only 10 basis points compared to are seasonally high fourth quarter year-end of 2021. The number of tenant terminations in the first quarter was the lowest recorded in the last five years. And our TRG portfolio occupancy was 93.2% at quarter-end, average base minimum rent increased compared to the fourth quarter and was $54.14. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and had a significant number of leases in our pipeline. In fact, at our recent leasing deal committee, we approved the most deals since 2016 and overall, we recently have approved approximately 500 new deals representing 2 million square feet. Demand is very strong and interesting with the volatility of the world, our portfolio in the U.S. is in great demand from worldwide brands, restaurants, and entertainment operators, as most retailers and tenants view the U.S. as the place to be. Sales momentum continued for our retailers, mall sales volume for the first quarter were up 19% year-over-year, we reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $734 per square foot, for the mall and outlet combined 43% increase and 669 per square foot for the Mills, which was a 50% increase. TRG reported 1,038 per square foot, which was a 52% year-over-year increase. Our occupancy cost is the lowest that we\u2019ve had in seven years. We are pleased with the results of our other platform investments in the first quarter, including SPARC Group and J.C. Penney. J.C. Penney\u2019s liquidity position is strong at $1.3 billion and it has no borrowings on its line of credit and performed better than planned. I can say the same for SPARC, which also performed better than planned in the quarter. SPARC also completed the U.S. Reebok transaction, and we anticipate great things from this iconic brand. Remember we expect Reebok to incur operating losses for SPARC in 2022, due to the integration aspects of the transaction. SPARC financial position like Penney is strong with the recent refinancing of its ABL, and it is in fact, a net cash positive position. During the quarter, however, our investments in Soho House and Life Time Holdings, which both became public companies at the end of last year were impacted by overall market volatility, driving an $0.08 unrealized non-cash mark-to-market. These are high quality businesses that fit with our flywheel of unique companies, and we believe these investments will generate value above our bases as they fully reopen and reengage with their customers. On the balance sheet front, we completed very timely, a dual tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.2 billion, including a 10-year fix rate offering at 2.65%. Early in the year, we used the net proceeds to pay off our amounts outstanding on our credit facility. We also refinanced seven mortgages for a total of $1.1 billion at an average interest rate of 2.92%. And our liquidity stands at $8 billion now. Today we announced our dividend of $1.70 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 21%. The dividend will be payable on June 30, including our dividends declared today, we paid more than $37 billion in dividends over our years as a public company, $37 billion. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program for up to $2 billion that will become effective on May 16. When we look at the valuation of our stock today at an FFO multiple of approximately 10 times relative to the historical valuations closer to 15 times, and an applied cap rate of around 7% for our real estate assets, we see substantial value in our stock, particularly given our belief and conviction in our future growth opportunities. Our balance sheet is strong, continues to be a significant advantage for us while our cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to adapt as conditions warrant and as we have proved countless times. We will be thoughtful and opportunistic on the buyback and keep in mind, this is in addition to the more than 20% increase in our dividend we announced today. Now, given our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.50 to $11.70 per share to $11.60 to $11.75 per share, which compares to our comparable number of $11.44 last year. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top or an 8% increase at the midpoint. This does not include the previously mentioned unrealized loss or gain that may occur the rest of the year on our fair value of investments that I mentioned and please keep in mind that this guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates. Now, just to conclude, I\u2019m pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent. And our real estate is a great hedge inflationary times, hopefully our operating results and our announced stock buyback authorization today reinforces that we are primarily focused internally and growing our existing platforms organically and I think that will conclude my comments. Ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Hi everyone, good evening. Maybe just on the guidance, I know you don\u2019t like to give too many of the pieces, but given the current volatility in the market and macro uncertainties, which may or may not be impacting Simon guidance was increased slightly at the midpoint. So I was wondering if you could give some detail on some of the puts and takes, what\u2019s performing ahead of your initial expectations versus what might be offsetting some of that upside surprise, maybe occupancy, leasing, retailer sales, interest rates, what everything\u2019s most relevant. David Simon : Sure. I mean you\u2019re right. The reason Caitlin, we don\u2019t go through the detail is, we are a big company and there\u2019s a lot going on and we think it\u2019s better for the market just to focus on in our totality of our results, but what\u2019s better is very simple. Our retail operations, which is our other retail properties is trending to be better than our plan. That\u2019s number one. Most importantly, our property NOI growth is projecting to be better than plan. And the only negatives that are offsetting that are we have some exposure to floating rate debt. We\u2019re probably at the very, very low end of other real estate companies, but we do have some. But we don\u2019t have any commercial paper outstanding. We don\u2019t have any outstanding on our line except for $125 million, which is primarily for tax purposes. And then obviously the strong dollar, when we bring back our foreign earnings, we have to do it at a lower dollar that that has a more meaningful impact than the rising interest rate environment. But so far demand is really, really good. I don\u2019t want \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t pound the table here too much we do sometimes we get carried away, but demand is great. Our leasing folks are very excited and our property NOI is better than what we anticipated, obviously because of the COVID a lot of restructurings on the leases and because of our high end tenant concentration and the amount of sales that they\u2019ve had. I mean there\u2019s volatility in that I cannot pinpoint exactly where our sales will come out on that. And that will have some impact on ultimately our results, but we try to give you a range here that we feel very comfortable that we can produce. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Thanks to that. I think the suggestion or guide is one question, so I\u2019ll stop there. David Simon : You\u2019re very kind to follow the rules. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rich Hill : Hey, good evening. I\u2019ll try to follow Caitlin\u2019s lead and follow the rules as well. Hey David, income from unconsolidated entities was a pretty healthy number this quarter, in the past 1Qs, it\u2019s been slightly negative. We modeled it negative in the quarter to be conservative. So I\u2019m just maybe wondering if you can walk us through what your expectations were for income consolidated entities versus how it actually played out? David Simon : Sure. I\u2019ll turn that over to Brian to walk you through actually put together, yes, a piece of paper there for you guys in the 8-K to walk you through that, because I know it\u2019s not confusing to us, but it might be to you. So hopefully this will help. Brian, take it over. Brian McDade : Hey, Hey Rich, Brian here. So we did add some additional disclosure to our supplement to breakdown our income from an unconsolidated entities. As you can see the driver of the changes, our joint venture activity on our property side, including the performance of our international portfolio, which David highlighted in open remarks. David Simon : And remember, international last year, really was suffering from more of a lockdown than the U.S. portfolio. Yes. Rich Hill : Got it. And I am allowed to ask a follow-up question if I were to follow the rules? David Simon : Sure. So if you did it so politely, yes, and you\u2019re gentlemen, we\u2019re happy to hopefully \u2013 go ahead. Go ahead. Rich Hill : Brian, I\u2019m sorry in advance of a to answer the dumb question, but the negative $18.5 million you reported for TRG, including amortization of excess investment. What is sort of that as a clean number and happy to take it offline, but I\u2019m actually just trying to back out how well TRG did this quarter prior \u2013 compared to prior quarters given the\u2026 Brian McDade : The $18 million was primarily from the excess investment of our \u2013 for the Tobin purchase. So this is net income, remember, Richard. David Simon : Yes. So we have to \u2013 when you capture things, obviously, you put it to market value and then we amortize that investment over its life has nothing to do with cash flow. Rich Hill : Okay. We can catch up later on Brian. Thank you. Brian McDade : No problem. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : Hey everyone. Thank you. Just, I guess, I get one on the retailer NOI contribution or I think it\u2019s the NOI from other platform investments. It was $26 million this quarter in first Q. But when I look at it versus last year, the contribution was I think around $3.5 million. So just wondering if you could walk us through the drivers and maybe the Delta between this quarter and last year. Brian McDade : Derek, the change is simply better performance out of our retailer investments in the first quarter of this year, relative to last year. There was still a lot of volatility still in the world. And there were definitely still closures throughout the U.S. specifically, California in the first quarter of last year. So the driver is just simply better performance out of the retailer investments. David Simon : It\u2019s good news, by the way, just so you \u2013 I just don\u2019t want you to be confused. It\u2019s always good to have better performance. Thank you, Brian. Brian McDade : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Okay. Yes, I just want to put it in perspective. It\u2019s good to have better performance. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Samir Khanal : Good evening, everybody. David, clearly the leasing environment is very strong. You talked about the 3 million square feet. But I was wondering if you could maybe provide color on sort of the pricing trends that you\u2019re seeing in the portfolio, whether it\u2019s the outlets or the malls \u2013 or the mills. Thanks. David Simon : Yes. I would say, generically that \u2013 look, when I say this and it sounds hokey, but you have to create the win-win. But we are in a better position today to negotiate what we think is a fair deal for us than we were the last couple years. So we are absolutely seen the ability to get what we think is fair market value. And the good news is given the occupancy cost, our retailers are \u2013 we\u2019re getting deals done. So we\u2019re finding that happy win-win. Samir Khanal : Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good evening. So David, there was a fairly substantial increase in month-to-month leases, increasing from 1.9% to 5.4%. Just curious what the primary drivers there were and what the opportunity is for leasing those potentially to maybe longer-term leases? David Simon : Well, I think what you\u2019re seeing is the fact that we have some big account leasing that we are not rushing to do, but doing it in a thoughtful manner, because we \u2013 these are really good properties and really important for the retailer and we\u2019re taking our time to get that done. And that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing. So whereas \u2013 last year or the year before, you might have seen a rush to get those signed up and in the door, we\u2019re taking a more strategic approach to create the kind of the win-win that I talked to, I mentioned earlier. So it\u2019s really part of our strategy and it\u2019ll \u2013 my anticipation without the question that number will be way down for Q2. Greg McGinniss : Okay. So this is just a during negotiation phase increase, but no kind of expectation for loss of those tenants and more so all shifting to long-term leases. David Simon : Absolutely not. And that was more of a decision on our side to get the right kind of deal that we have with some of our larger national accounts, so no issue there. Greg McGinniss : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Haendel Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel Juste : Hey, good evening. Dave, I wanted to ask you about, I guess, capital allocation given where the stock price is. Now you put out the valuation discount. As you consider the debt market. I guess, would you buy back stock now? And then in the same answer, how are you thinking about acquisitions? There is rumor to be a very large seller out there, some pretty good malls. So just curious of under any scenario, would you be a buyer of some. Thanks? David Simon : Sure. Well, as I said to you earlier, I mean, we got the authorization because we want to buy our stock back because we think it\u2019s under-valued. So because of the technicalities we really can\u2019t get into the market until the 16. But this is not window dressing, I expect us to be in the market. And all I can say to you and I really don\u2019t like to comment on the stuck that\u2019s out there on M&A. But I would throw caution note to all that I would suggest that please don\u2019t believe any rumours or media reports concerning our M&A activity, okay. We\u2019re \u2013 we are very focused on what I said to you, see our \u2013 if you want to able to listen to my prepared remarks, you\u2019ll see kind of what I said on that front we\u2019re really, really focused internally. And obviously, given where the stock has performed over the last couple of months, I mean, we think it\u2019s an opportunity to be opportunistic in terms of buying our stock back. So that\u2019s kind of \u2013 I mean, again, that\u2019s kind of how I look at things. So don\u2019t believe what you read or any rumours out there. We\u2019re really focused on growing our existing platforms and taking advantage of the opportunities that our lower stock price represents. Haendel Juste : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Connor Mitchell : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So could you please tell us what percent of tenants are now on percent rent deals and how those tenants are performing in the current environment if different at all? David Simon : I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, every one of our retailers generally has a percent rent clause, not every single one of them. I mean, some of our big boxes and our department stores do not. But all of our small shop retailers usually have some kind of percent rent aspect to the weeks. So, that\u2019s a high percent, so that\u2019s number one. And number two, look so far, we\u2019re in an uncertain environment as a global economy. But what I would say to you just general terms so far from the better, the higher income folks, we have not seen any kind of slowdown. There may be a little bit of slowdown on the lower income consumer obviously, unfortunately the inflation is a huge issue and we need to do everything we can to figure out as a world and in the country, figure out how to deal with the impact on inflation for the lower income consumer. But we are not \u2013 so far, we\u2019re not seeing it in our portfolio. Connor Mitchell : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Great. Thank you. David, you talked a little bit about spending a lot of time internally, obviously leasing the portfolio. I was wondering if you can update us a little bit sort of on the external front, in terms of retailer investments or technologic \u2013 technology investments. I know you still have the SPAC out there, which obviously that market\u2019s gotten a little choppier. But just how much time and what sort of opportunities are coming out of this macro environment for you to further moving this tanker towards a lot of those activities that you\u2019ve been planting the seeds for a number of years. David Simon : I think Michael, our SPAC \u2013 we still have confidence in the SPAC. I mean, we have a clock running out. But we still have confidence that there\u2019s a really good chance the SPAC will find a good opportunity. And I think the opportunity set clearly has increased given the market volatility even with existing public companies. And we were smart enough to not do a deal probably at the time after we raised the SPAC that would\u2019ve been at the market top. So hopefully our investors in that obviously recognize that. And remember, this is immaterial for Simon Property Group. But I want to say that. So on the external front, I mentioned to you earlier, right now, we are really focused internally. Now we\u2019re investing in all of the platforms that we have in our existing portfolio. Lots of redevelopment is still on the drawing board. And we\u2019re \u2013 SPARC is making investments in its technology, Penney will be making investments. Those come from those entities, we don\u2019t have to fund those. They\u2019re self-sustaining, Penney has hundreds of millions of dollars of EBITDA. So they\u2019re funding themselves. But right now our focus is what I mentioned to you before. And look, if we see an interesting add on here or there, or bolt-on for one of our properties or one of our investments, maybe there\u2019s some capital allocation. But I think right now it\u2019s capital allocation I see is either to the shareholders or to grow our existing book of business. Michael Bilerman : David, just as a follow-up, just in terms of just understanding sort of the value to Simon and the value for shareholders of all these investments you\u2019ve made. The Board back in, I think it was like mid-February, granted, I think it was about $36 million to five senior executives. And I think a little bit more to 18 others for the successful investment in ABG. Now, I recognize you haven\u2019t made money, you\u2019ve exchanged stakes, you\u2019ve invested more capital. But maybe just to step back, can you sort of share a little bit, at least at the Simon group level, how much of these investments have made for which the Board then paid the cash out to executives? David Simon : Well, I don\u2019t even know how to answer that, Michael. I\u2019m not going to talk about comp on this call. If you are an investor, would like to talk to our comp Chairman, we\u2019re happy to arrange that for one of your investors directly. I think what you\u2019re referring to is, we\u2019ve made $1 billion on our ABG investment. And that was kind of \u2013 we were moonlighting in that activity, and I\u2019ll leave it at that, but thanks for your question. And our Comp Committee Chair is available to any institutional investors and shareholders on the rationale for what they did, but we\u2019ll move on from now. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Yes. We\u2019ve just been \u2013 we got asked what the math was [indiscernible]. David Simon : We\u2019re \u2013 like I said, any institutional investor, we\u2019re more than happy to set up a phone call with our Chair of our Comp Committee. Thank you, Michael. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please go ahead. Vince Tibone : Hi, good afternoon. Domestic property NOI growth was up 7.5% in the first quarter, which implies you\u2019re expecting NOI growth to be only marginally positive for the remainder of the year based on the 2% NOI growth guidance you gave last quarter. Just given the contractual rent bumps and year-over-year occupancy gains that you should experience each quarter, what factors are negatively impacting the growth rate for the rest of the year? David Simon : Well, I don\u2019t \u2013 again, we \u2013 it\u2019s a completely appropriate question, and I thank you for that. We gave guidance, NOI guidance at the beginning of the year. We are always trying to be conservative, and we always hope to outperform it. We don\u2019t update it during the year. But I have confidence based upon what I know today, that we\u2019ll outperform our initial guidance. Obviously, we have a little more variability than maybe \u2013 and then again, I don\u2019t want to overdramatize this, but we have a little more variability than maybe we did 10 years ago, because of the overage rent that we\u2019ve structured. I think we\u2019ve actually structured it pretty smartly, but it does create a little more variability. And that\u2019s our only \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s out there to throw some caution to the wind. What we see now, we expect to outperform, but it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t update it and it is an uncertain world, but we\u2019re working extremely smartly and diligently to outperform our initial property NOI expectations, without a doubt. Vince Tibone : If I may just kind of squeeze in a follow-up. I mean just is it \u2013 how should we think about leasing economics here? Because you took away the disclosure on the leasing spreads or a few quarters ago, which I think made sense, given it was no longer really conveying a ton of useful information. But just \u2013 because I think what I\u2019m trying to get at is guidance implying that are releasing spreads could be negative or \u2013 like I\u2019m just trying to figure out what the pullback years of expense is, because I get the variability portion. But to your point, is that\u2026 David Simon : Yes, I\u2019m sorry, Vince, I didn\u2019t mean to cut you off. It really is \u2013 it really does boil down to the sales part of the equation. It\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re seeing better rents than we anticipated. And we are seeing \u2013 look, if you Again, I don\u2019t want to get into this, and we tried to get everybody to do the spreads the way we did it. But no one was interested in really doing what we did. If you really read the footnotes, and I don\u2019t want to get into it, but it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s comical what rent spreads are. Words are different, whatever. It\u2019s not really important. Point is, the way you really see it is what is our portfolio NOI. And that manifests itself with everything, operating expenses, sales-based rent, overage rent, et cetera, occupancy. Our rents are firming. Our \u2013 if you really would do like just space to space, our spreads are basically positive and because we went through a lot of pain in the last couple of years. And again, because the overage was really quite exciting last year. We just don\u2019t know if we can be as excited this year, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re being a little cautious, but we\u2019re off to a good start. Vince Tibone : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Additional color. David Simon : Thank you , Vince. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yes. I\u2019m curious, has your view on the pace or the magnitude of the occupancy recovery changed meaningfully thinking about for the next few years since the beginning of the year? David Simon : I would say to you, if I understand your question, I think, we are really happy at the pace of our accelerating occupancy and clearly based upon last year, I think we\u2019re ahead of where we thought we would be. And I\u2019m hoping that to get the occupancy up to kind of where we were prior to the COVID. So I think, we\u2019re \u2013 and I mean demand again until the lease is signed, until it\u2019s a piece of paper until I get that first month rent, it ain\u2019t over until it\u2019s over, but we feel pretty good. And like I mentioned in the call, I mean our terminations were at the lowest level they\u2019ve been in a long, long time and our deal committee, I think we\u2019ve had a \u2013 we have a really good leasing group. They\u2019re energetic. They\u2019re grinding away. They\u2019re working. I mean, we\u2019ve turned our leasing group kind of not over, but we\u2019ve added a lot of new talent to the organization. And I think we\u2019re in a pretty good spot, assuming, things are continue to be macro, continue to be reasonable. I don\u2019t think we need, last year\u2019s results, but I just, and don\u2019t underestimate and I\u2019m rambling on here. But don\u2019t underestimate that our interest in our domestic portfolio is worldwide and as retailers or restaurant tours or entertainment operators, they\u2019re not looking at China, South America\u2019s a tough market for them, Europe is, it\u2019s got the recovery play because of the COVID lockdown, but it\u2019s relatively flat. And obviously you got the Ukraine issue, which is more there than here. And so the growth for the worldwide retailers is in the U.S. We were not at the top of mine three, four years ago. That was China. It is here, it\u2019s happening domestic. So that\u2019s exciting. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. So it sounds like the past couple of months really hasn\u2019t derailed that at all? David Simon : Not at all. Mike Mueller : Okay. That was it. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi, good afternoon. How are you thinking about distribution channels for the various brands within your SPARC platform? What\u2019s the best way to maximize the reach and visibility of these retailer investments? David Simon : Well, they still love physical stores. I think if I \u2013 look, I think each brand is different. So with Arrow, it\u2019s the physical stores and the e-commerce with Nautica it\u2019s stores, but wholesale business is very important. Brooks Bothers is a combination of e-commerce, wholesale and stores. Forever 21, the stores are really important. That\u2019s the big differentiating factor it has compared to some of its peers. On the other hand, it needs to improve via e-commerce business. So it really within SPARC, there\u2019s different brands and it really depends on the brand, but don\u2019t underestimate. And I think, what we\u2019ve seen since COVID, I mean, let\u2019s not forget when we had COVID everybody said the stores are out of business, no stores, e-commerce, what we\u2019re seeing is generally out performance, way out performance in the physical world, less performance on the internet or and that\u2019s not just for our brands, but across every, essentially every retailer. Linda Tsai : And then how does JCPenney fit in there as a distribution channel? David Simon : Well, I mean, they have their stores and their e-commerce business. I think the store business is doing well. And I think over time they\u2019ll improve their e-commerce. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Greg Smith : Yes, thanks. David, what percent of expiring rents in 2022 have been addressed? And are you primarily working on 2023 at the ICSC leasing convention? David Simon : Well, we would, again, I think you missed part of the earlier call. So I\u2019d say to you by the end of Q2, well, probably be in the 70%, 75% range of all of our leasing activity for 2022. And I would say we are doing a combination, at this point now you\u2019re really more focused on 2023 deals, but we\u2019re doing a combination of finishing lease to get lease assigned this year, some may open, but a lot of them opened in for 2023. And then I think the primary focus on at ICSC will be a new business, 2023 business. Greg Smith : Great. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. Just wanted to talk a little bit about investment opportunities external. I know you said not to listen to what\u2019s out there in the press, but not withstanding. Do you see better opportunities or would Simon be more interested the real estate company investing more in high-quality malls? Or is the idea of maybe looking at shopping center real estate kind of interesting, given what we\u2019ve seen in some of the changes with COVID and consumer behaviors? David Simon : Well, that\u2019s the policy. I mean, I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, our mall \u2013 outdoor versus indoor, our mall business is doing great. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 and I would say to you one, good real estate can be indoors. It could be outdoors. It could be hybrid, and they don\u2019t get carried away in the physical plan of great real estate. It could be a mixed use. It could be an outdoor center. It could be a big enclosed mall like Houston Galleria. So I know a lot of people spin it that way, but I will tell you, good retail real estate can come in a lot of different forms, a lot of different forms. So we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re just \u2013 I can\u2019t really answer the question because there\u2019s not one project that we\u2019re pursuing right now. And \u2013 like I said earlier, we think the opportunities \u2013 the greatest opportunities lie within Simon Property Group. Juan Sanabria : And just if I can, a quick follow-up. You mentioned you think your cap rate \u2013 your implied cap rate\u2019s around 7%. What do you think high-quality malls are valued at today, given the move in interest rates? And just curious what your thoughts are on valuations. David Simon : Well, I mean I don\u2019t know. I mean I know I wouldn\u2019t be selling our stuff at a 7% cap rate. That\u2019s all. I can only speak for myself. Juan Sanabria : Fair enough. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, we touched a lot on the outlook. But does the updated guidance consider any changes in expectation for the retailer investments for 2022? And then the $0.15 to $0.20 of additional investment expected for the year, what\u2019s the expected cadence? Is that equally distributed through the year? Or is that hitting harder in the first or second half? David Simon : Okay. The first question is not really on the retail side. We\u2019re anticipating more or less if they come in on plan. And then I didn\u2019t follow. Brian, did you understand the second part of the question? Brian McDade : Can you repeat it, please? David Simon : Yes, Michael Michael Goldsmith : Last quarter, you talked about $0.15 to $0.20 of additional investment expected in the year, what\u2019s the expected cadence of that? David Simon : Yes. That\u2019s \u2013 okay. That\u2019s what I thought, but I want to make sure. So Reebok closed. SPARC bought the U.S. operations of Reebok at the end of February, if I remember correctly. And we think that will come out most of \u2013 it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it probably will come out in the Q2, Q3. But it\u2019s not really \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a work in progress or when those operating losses will take hold. They incur certain operating losses, I should say, they, we. SPARC concurs. Certain operating losses is part of the deal and then they\u2019re capped, and it really is just a function of when those come. It\u2019s \u2013 but we know it\u2019s limited to kind of the number that I gave to you \u2013 but that\u2019s probably a Q2, Q3 event. Brian McDade : Got to ramp up, Michael. So they\u2019ve got to actually incur the cost to have the \u2013 so it\u2019s just going to take a little bit of time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum [Compass Point]. Please go ahead. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks for taking my question. David, maybe you touched upon the fact that your occupancy cost is low. If you could just \u2013 can you share that occupancy cost? And also, what was your occupancy cost prior to COVID and how quickly will you get back to those kinds of levels in your view? David Simon : Yes. So our \u2013 the number right now is 12.3%. What was it? What was \u2013 no, no, before COVID. No, it was higher than that. That was higher than that. Anyway, we\u2019ll give you the number where it was pre-COVID, but I thought it was in the kind of the high 13%, 14% range. But we\u2019ll get you \u2013 what was it? Brian McDade : 13 and change. David Simon : 13 and change. And look, I can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019s going to take a function of it is just marking leases to market. But it\u2019s fortunate for us and our retailers that they\u2019re profitable in our stores. And yet, at the same time, we can mark the rents up to market and be able to grow our business, too. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to achieve. Floris Van Dijkum : Great. And if I can maybe have a follow-up as well. Obviously, you cited your leased occupancy. What is the gap between occupied and leased space right now? And how do you see that trending over the next couple of quarters. And presumably, some of that lease space could be anchors, which could be slower to get online. So is that gap always going to be \u2013 remain steady? Or do you expect that to narrow over the next 12 months? David Simon : I think Tom can give you the exact numbers later, but I mean both trends are in the moving in the right direction. So Tom, to get you the actual numbers, but both are moving in the right direction. And I think that the gap between the two in a good market like we have now will narrow. Floris Van Dijkum : Great. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. I think \u2013 oh, sorry, go ahead, sir. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks. David Simon : Okay. Thank you and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see some of you in the next few weeks. Thank you. Brian McDade : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Thank you. Pleased to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.96 per share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.05 from a mark-to-market and fair value of publicly held securities. Let me walk you through the big variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2021. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter and contributed $0.13 of growth driven by higher rental income of $0.09, strong performance in Simon Brand Ventures and short-term leasing of $0.05. TRG contributed $0.04 of growth, and they were partially offset by higher operating costs of approximately $0.05. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.10. Lower interest rate -- interest expense contributed $0.03, and these $0.26 of positive contributions were partially offset by the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.03 and a $0.19 lower contribution from our other platform investments, principally from JCPenney and a couple of brands within SPARC. These costs include --these included costs associated with JCPenney's launch of new brands, the recent Reebok transaction and the integration costs associated with that and a softening of sales from our value-oriented brands due to inflationary pressures on that consumer. We generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which was $200 million higher than the first quarter of this year. And we have generated $2.2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. Domestic property NOI increased 3.6% year-over-year for the quarter and 5.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, grew 4.6% for the quarter and 6.7% for the first 6 months. Occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 93.9%, an increase of 210 basis points and TRG was at 93.4%. The number of tenant terminations this year has been at record low levels. Average base rent increased -- average base minimum rent increased for the third quarter in a row and was at $54.58. Leasing momentum accelerated across our portfolio. We signed nearly 1,300 leases for more than 4 million square feet in the quarter, have signed over 2,200 leases for more than 7 million square feet through the first half of the year, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. Nearly 40% of our total leasing activity in the first 6 months of the year has been new deal volume. This is up approximately 25% from last year. Retail sales continued. Mall sales volumes for the second quarter were up 7%. Our reported retailer sales per square foot reached another record in the second quarter at $746 per square foot for the malls and the outlets combined, which was an increase of 26%, $674 for the mills, a 29% increase. TRG was at $1,068 per square foot, a 35% increase. We began our national outlet shopping day, which was very successful from shoppers and participating retailers offering a timely first-of-its-kind power shopping experience. More than 3 million shoppers visited our premium outlets and mills over the shopping weekend. Feedback following the event has been tremendous from both our retailers and consumers. We're already planning next year's event, which we expect to be bigger. So please stay tuned on that. Our occupancy cost at the end of the quarter are the lowest they've been in 7 years, 12.1% in Q2 of 2022. Now our other platform of investments, let's talk about it. We were pleased with the results of our investments in the platform for the second quarter. They contributed approximately $0.21 in FFO, even though we were down from last year's terrific results, primarily, as I mentioned, continued investment and the inflationary pressures that have developed. Based on our distributions -- based upon our cash distributions received, we have no cash equity investment in SPARC and JCPenney. And in fact, we have parlayed our SPARC investment into our investment in ABG that is now worth over $1 billion. There will be a little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter when it comes to SPARC and JCPenney, but please keep in -- this in the proper perspective. It's all upside from here. During the quarter, we also, as I mentioned, had our mark on our SoHo and Lifetime Holdings of $0.05. A reminder on that it's a noncash mark, and we would expect that those companies would bounce back. We completed the refinancing of 14 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $1.6 billion at an average interest rate of 3.75%. We reduced our share of total indebtedness by more than $650 million. And once again, our balance sheet is strong. We had $8.5 billion of liquidity. $8.5 billion. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.75 per share for the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 17%. This will be payable at the end of the third quarter, September 30. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $144 million. And let me point out while other companies in our sector are paying little or no dividends and issuing equity, we are repeatedly raising our dividend and buying our stock back. We have now returned more than $37 billion of capital to our shareholders since we've been public. $37 billion. Given our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.60 to $11.75 per share to the new range of $11.70 to $11.77 per share, which compares to a comparable number of last year of $11.44 per share. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.06 at the midpoint of the range. The guidance comes in the face, obviously, of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and the inflationary pressures that are out there in the marketplace. So let me conclude. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Our business is strong. The higher income consumer is in good shape, brick-and-mortar stores are where the shoppers want to be, outpacing e-commerce across the world and the broad retail spectrum. Demand for our space is extremely strong. Worldwide retailers need to grow, and they're doubling down on the U.S. International tourism is returning. Domestic tourism is strong. Our redevelopment pipeline is growing with exciting projects. And in addition to our newly announced premium outlet, new developments and expansions, we are experienced at managing our business through volatile periods, including leveraging our existing platform for operating efficiencies, allocating capital appropriately, managing risks. We are not over our skis in any aspect of our business. I encourage you to look at our track record. We outperform in these kinds of periods, and we also do some of our best work as well. So thank you, operator. We're ready for any questions at this moment. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : It's actually Michael Bilerman here with Craig. David, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about sort of that inflationary pressure that's on the retailers that you're starting to experience first-hand and obviously, your knowledge base of the retailer environment is significant. But now actually being on both sides, what can you do as a landlord to help your tenants through this period of time where they are dealing with a lot of inflationary pressures and more inventory because arguably, I know from a landlord perspective, you want your rent to inflate and that just makes matters worse. So can you just talk a little bit about the things that you can do to take share and really leverage what you're learning on the retailer side for the benefit of shareholders? David Simon : Well, thank you, Michael, for that question. So look, we're not presumptuous to tell any retailer under any circumstance how to run their business. So it's really entirely up to them on how they see fit, how to manage inventory et cetera. And just our own experience within SPARC, we have several brands. And we did see some softness in the more value-oriented brands. And again, we do think that pressure on the consumer with respect to food, housing, obviously, gas, and they reined it in. But again, I think the important thing to keep in mind, Michael, is even with that said, we were profitable. We had an unbelievably strong year last year with Penney and SPARC. We're still projecting really high EBITDA growth for these companies. And even though they're -- obviously, their consumers being cautious, back-to-school so far is off to a good start. Our traffic is actually pretty good. And I think just from our own operating experience, the SPARC management team and the Penney, I think, do what a lot of retailers do. They rein in discretionary capital. They watch the overhead. They really don't close stores because stores are profitable to them. They watch marketing expenses that -- they're very focused on the payback when it comes to return on investment [Indiscernible] digital spending. So I think the JCPenney and SPARC team will do kind of similar to what others, but we would never tell a retailer what they should do. If they want to compare notes, we're happy to do that, but that's just not our style. And again,-- and we try to -- it's really important. This other business that we're in is not our -- it's a very small part of our business. It's under 10% at the end of the day. We have no cash adjustment in it. So I've got -- I'm just talking cash-on-cash return, let's go simple math. I've taken distributions, cash distributions in both SPARC and Penney that basically has me at a zero net investment. And it will -- they'll have volatility with the earnings like any other retailer, and that's just the way of the world. And it's all upside, frankly. And these businesses are importantly, and this is very important, they're very well positioned. They're very well positioned to weather if this continues, which we kind of expected to. They're very well positioned to weather any storm because as a simple example, JCPenney has $1.3 billion of liquidity, just to throw that out there. So I hope that answers your question. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : David, a question on -- following up on the retailer platform income. The NOI this year was like $116 million in the year. Last year, it was $195 million. So is this some of the volatility that you're talking about? And just curious what drove that mark? And if I can do a footnote for a sort of quasi second question, you mentioned something about the value brands in your retailer platform, having trouble, but the other brands were doing well. Maybe just a little bit more comment on that. David Simon : Yes. Look, Alex, it was $0.19 for the quarter. So we can spend a lot of time on it. But the reason I went through with you is because we have no cash investments in these businesses. So I'm happy to go through it, but let's put it in perspective, please. The point is -- yes. So let's just talk about SPARC. SPARC, Nautica, Brooks Brothers, Lucky did great, above budget. Eddie Bauer, above budget, so on. The only softness we really saw was a little bit in the team market at Arrow, a little bit in the fast fashion business in F21 and a little bit in JCPenney. We -- and we also -- as we told everyone at the beginning of the year, we had significant integration costs at SPARC with respect to the Reebok transaction. So that -- and obviously, that closed, and we saw some of that in the second quarter. So that's the status. Everything -- we also had a management change in F21, which we think will be for the better. That happened, I believe, at the beginning of the year. We've got our -- we also had our new CEO at Penney, which also happened last year. So they're absolutely greatly positioned. We've got all the confidence in the world and it's a retailer and there'll be ups and downs, $0.19 added $2.96, okay? That's the math and no investment -- no cash investment, okay? So I think I answered it, but if there's something you'd like me to dwell on more than I did, I'm happy to do. Well, I guess that's the one question, right? So it's over, right? Go ahead, Alex. I'll let you -- because I like you, go ahead. What else you got? Alexander Goldfarb : Well, then I'll ask you one other question. You guys are always financially savvy and you buy back stock. I'm imagining that buying back debt is not attractive just given where your outstanding debt coupons are or has the disruptions in the debt markets giving you opportunity to buy certain pieces of paper? David Simon : Well, we unencumbered -- the reason we have lower interest expense is because we unencumbered assets. We have that flexibility. So we don't like the mortgage market, unlike some others. We just write a check, and we -- that's why we have lower interest expense compared to last year, and I did the Q-over-Q because we can write a check and just unencumber it. Brian McDade : At a lower cost. David Simon : At a lower cost. So we look at that all the time. And that may not be buying debt back, but it's more or less the same thing. Ends in the same result. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : David, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the leasing pipeline. It was nice to see the occupancy up as much as it was from Q1 to Q2. But could you talk a little bit more about the pipeline, the types of tenants? And when you sort of look at the demand, if you sort of were to try and bifurcate the portfolio maybe by sales, I guess, how different is the demand for the really strong centers versus maybe centers in the middle and the lower end of the portfolio? David Simon : Well, again, our lower end is just not -- just to get -- it's a good question because we don't put these numbers in, but our EBITDA weighted -- this excludes TRG, but our EBITDA weighted sales are $954 a foot. Our average base rent actually increased 70 basis points -- at 73, 41 versus 70, 287. So -- and that's what's driving our NOI, right, because it's the bigger properties. Look, it is across the board. It's also across the retail type. It's restaurants. It's entertainment. It's obviously the high-end folks, but it's a -- and I don't like naming retailers. Rick does, but bother me, and he's not here to do it. So -- but we have value-oriented retailers that are on very much aggressive opening program. So it really is across the board. Only the best properties get the high-end folks. We're seeing a big rebound in Vegas. Florida is on fire. California spying the sea legs. Westchester and Roseville Field are all coming back as the suburb. So Midwest has been stable. So we're seeing it across the board by retailer, by price point, by geography, by mix pretty much across the board. And -- so I mean I'm not -- it's not really granular and you probably wanted names. But -- and we have not seen, thankfully, even with the -- with what's going on in the world. We really haven't seen anyone back out of deals of note at all. And I said this last quarter, I said it this quarter in my prepared remarks. The U.S. is the -- let's hope the U.S., we don't screw it up. But the U.S. is the bastion of growth for the world compared to -- because we know China is with the way COVID is dealt with there, that's going to have ebbs and flows. And I think our economy is still pretty healthy. Consumers in good shape. I think the growth will continue in the U.S., and I think the future is bright here. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Adam Kramer : I just wanted to drill in a little bit more on capital allocation. Obviously, raised the dividend here again was active on the buyback in the quarter in just a couple of months. Put out these kind of press releases as well about some of the kind of the new and renewed development projects. So I just wanted to kind of maybe hear you kind of maybe rank or just kind of discuss the different options for capital allocation here. And I know external growth is always maybe an option as well. You talked about it last quarter, but maybe if you could just kind of rank the different options here with your capital and excess free cash flow. David Simon : Well, look, as a REIT, it will always be the dividend. So that would -- I mean, it's hard to rank it. But I think clearly, the dividend we have to pay out 90% to 95% of our taxable income. There's a difference to you pay out 90% technically versus 95%. But you got to pay out 95% of our taxable income. We're fortunate to be highly -- we had taxable income. So we pay out close to -- we're at 100% of our taxable income. That's growing. So that's going to be paid out in cash. Obviously, we've modified that twice in our history. One was COVID, obviously, when we were shut down and two was in The Great Recession. So that always will rank number one. Two is we -- our stock is just -- we look at other REITs. We look at other S&P 500 companies. We look at our balance sheet. We look at the fact that we're a cash flow company that generates cash, return on equity, we make deals like SPARC that gets all our money back, and we have free cash flow. We can't figure out our value. So the reality is the market -- we have refuted e-commerce, taking the malls down. We have still COVID. Our business is strong, growing in the enclosed mall business. In the enclosed mall business is strong, yet we have naysayers out there that don't believe it, but we believe it. So our stock is cheap, and we're going to keep buying stock back. And then I think we have a duty to make our properties as efficient and as attractive as we can to the consumer. I mean, obviously, we have to do it with a remind -- we had to do it with a return on investment methodology, i.e., if we had a property and we spent all this money on and got no return, we wouldn't do it. But where we can do that, that's what we should do and we will do that and then the external stuff I don't really care about. And if it's there and it makes sense, we'll do it. We have the flexibility to do it. But I'd rather do the dividend, buy our ridiculously cheap stock back, make our existing portfolio better and then every once in a while, we'll have great new development to do they'll do it because that also is a core competency of ours that we'll do. And that's how I look at it. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Yes. So on real estate, Phipps Plaza, slated for an October open or relaunch, let's say. So David, I believe you took roughly a and NOI offline to develop. So upon stabilization, what NOI contribution from this project is expected? And really, should we look at this as one of the key earnings accretion blueprints looking ahead with other mixed projects? David Simon : Yes. Thank you. I'm happy to talk on real estate. And look, I mean, Phipps is fantastic story because we took an old department store. It had was an underperformer, had 14 acres. We couldn't redevelop it. We're going to spend around $350 million, and we're going to get about a $35 million of NOI just on that. But more importantly -- well, I shouldn't say more importantly, in addition to that, -- and eventually, we'll show everybody what we did, but we -- the leasing momentum that we have created there in terms of retenanting, re-leasing Phipps is staggering. So Phipps, again, we don't really disclose that. But my guess is the existing property will increase by roughly 30% NOI when we're done with it, if not more without that -- not including the incremental that's what I just mentioned. But because of all the retenanting and more importantly, we will have all of the best brands when we're done with it, and that's ongoing. That won't all be done probably until '24 because some of the other existing retailers have leases, and they're coming over after that. But we're taking a quiet mall and making it -- and it's going to be, I think, the hub of activity in a great area in Buckhead and a lot of good stuff is happening in Atlantic at the same time. But yes, the simple answer to your question is I would hope to do that in Brea, Ross Park, go down the list. But yes, we have a ton of those opportunities and the mixed use -- most of our real estate is really well located and adding the mixed-use components, especially residential really does add a lot of synergy, a lot of mojo of the property. So we hope for that to continue. Operator : Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : David, hopefully, easy two-part for you. But how is the broader economic environment adjusted the process for adding projects to development pipeline, then how it increases in construction costs and labor shortages impacted pipeline returns and time lines? David Simon : Let me talk time lines. The only -- the biggest issue that we're having on time lines is in what I call in the restaurant industry in that some of the equipment required to open restaurants does have a backlog. This -- the storefront improvement is increasing. Obviously, tenants are very, very focused on that, not affecting timing, but it is something that we're watching has not affected deal flow or deal economics. And I do think the good news when it comes to at least materials, we are at a lower level than we were a few months ago. So on a timing side, it's really just equipment for restaurants. On our return development, nothing -- yes, we have a little bit more here and there, but nothing that is going to ultimately decide to go from a go project to a negative. If anything, in a lot of these cases, we're planning on higher income, so they seem to be getting basically the same returns. But we're not -- nothing has changed dramatically that would suddenly scratch the project. Greg McGinniss : If I could just add just real quick to that. What about now that you have a lower priced stock to investment in the stock versus redevelopment expense side David Simon : I think we can do both. I think we -- and again, I mean, some of these things, we really want folks to focus on others in our sector. When you put us in perspective, we're buying stock back. We're not issuing equity, and we're raising our dividend. I don't -- there are very few and you can define the sector anyway you want, and I don't want -- but there's not many -- we're just built a little bit differently even though we may be in the same industry, we were built differently, okay. And so that's the important point, and that's why we really try to emphasize it much like we emphasize SPARC about some of the mathematical differences about our company beyond just we're in the same business. It is math. At the end of the day, you got to run your business, so the math works. But yes, I'd like buying our stock back. But like I said, I do think we have a duty to continue to invest in our portfolio as long as we see the right return on investment on that. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : The year-over-year ABR per square foot looks pretty strong at about up 5%. Is there anything out of the ordinary driving that? David Simon : No, I just think we've worked well together and the portfolio is in great shape and driving -- and we're driving growth out of it collectively. So it's all good. Operator : Our next question is from Floris Gerbrand Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris Gerbrand Van Dijkum : Last quarter, you indicated that your signed not open pipeline was around 200 basis points, I believe, and it was a little bit higher in the malls than the outlets. I was curious if you can give an update on that. And also maybe, David, you've got these retailers. Are you -- everybody has been talking about a glut of inventory, will you create outlet stores for some of your retailers? And where else are you seeing some of the demand for the outlets coming from? Is there more luxury potentially that's coming to the outlets or homewares? Or where -- what other segments do you think will expand into the outlet business? David Simon : I'll let Brian answer the -- it was very clever to get two questions. I'll let Brian answer the first, and then I'll take a shot at the second part. Brian McDade : Floris, we're still hovering right around 200 basis points in the second quarter. David Simon : And then I would say -- the big, big retailers had a glut of inventory. We -- the luxury guys do not have a glut of inventory, okay? So that's not happening. And to the extent that -- the SPARC brands, by and large, are already in a lot of outlets, some of ours. A lot or not ours. There's really no change in plan. Maybe there's been a few -- some of the brands, not just SPARC but elsewhere had a few pop-ups. But net ebbs and flows, I don't think, Floris, there's any interesting dynamic going on that. And there's not a lot of folks with a glut of inventory as far as I can see, I mean, obviously, some bigger folks. But most of those guys want to plug through their existing system, and there is no -- the higher-end folks, there's no glut of inventory that we see. Operator : Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Could you drill down a little more on sales trends during the quarter? Did sales start to slow down at all in the back half of the quarter as inflation accelerated and recession period increased? David Simon : No. No, not really. So it was -- I mean, not really. We didn't really -- in fact, in July, in a lot of cases, we saw a little bit better results recently. So no real trend there, Vince. Vince Tibone : That's good to hear. That's helpful. And then just maybe 1 follow-up to that. Are you seeing any difference in tenant sales performance between the higher end and luxury tenants versus the more three brands, presumably the latter would be more impacted by the inflation issues? David Simon : I would absolutely -- we definitely have seen that where the value-oriented retailers or -- there's no question the consumer that is pressed on discretionary income is dealing with a very difficult situation with food, obviously, gas and dwelling. So -- and they're reining in their spend. So there's no question about that. But we're -- but we haven't really seen that at all in kind of the better brands. And like I mentioned earlier, SPARC, like the Brooks Brothers, the luckies of the world are doing very well. But where you do see it a little bit is in the value-oriented retailer or the younger consumer that suddenly gas has taken a lot out of the pocket book. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Domestic same-store NOI was up 3.6% compared to 7.5%. It looks like a lot of it was due to the tougher comps in second quarter. And in that case, it seems like the comps only get more difficult third and fourth quarter. Is that why the same-store number might actually be going down for the second half of the year? Or is it the macro factors? David Simon : No. I mean, Craig, we were really clear. We're actually outperforming what we thought. We -- Q1 of last year had the big benefit of going up against COVID, right? So now we were really, really clear what we saw overall, and we've been outperforming. And I think we'll outperform our initial guidance of 2%, but that's nothing other than that or normal seasonality of the business, Craig. Yes. I mean this is better than our plan and is consistent with our plan, even though the trend is above our plan. Craig Schmidt : So your leasing year-to-date, if you will, is strong enough that you think that -- has it continued in July? And do you think you could continue despite some of the macro factors? David Simon : Well, I've said that several times. Yes, the answer is we have not -- our pipeline is as strong as it's been. We're doing a bunch of new deals. Now Craig, you know when you sign a lease, the store doesn't open tomorrow in a lot of cases. And this is really, really important for everyone to understand, we're very optimistic because a lot of the leasing that we've done really doesn't open until '23, '24. So not only are we outperforming our budget this year off a strong last year, but we actually feel really good that as we get these stores open that we leased to over the last 6, 9 months. That will continue to fuel positive comp NOI. Thank you, Craig. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : On the guidance, the low end of the range has come up, the high end relatively flat at a time when you're seeing softening of sales at your lower income brand. So my question is, what's implied for the performance of the base business in the second half kind of relative to what you saw in the domestic and international operations in the second quarter? Maybe said another way, how sensitive is your performance to the macro environment? And what's the outlook for percentage rents? David Simon : Well, it's a very -- look, I think we feel really positive about the portfolio, the results that will generate from the portfolio. And again, the higher income consumer is still spending money. And if anything, I think if you go back in history and actually, Tom did a very good piece on that. If any of you're interested, you can call Tom. He'll go through it with you. Our business and our industry actually tends to outperform during recessionary environments to the extent that we get there and maybe we're in one, maybe we're not, I'll stay out of that political definition primarily because the big ticket items suddenly go toward kind of what we sell at our product. So -- and that's kind of somewhat of an insurance policy and it's historically always proved to be very positive. So even in every recession, other than COVID when we were told to shut down, our cash flow from our properties was flat. It did not decrease. So Tom has a great paper on it. If you're interested, we'll charge you, but we'll give you the data. I think the same case will be here. We'll -- if we do get into a full-blown recession, our cash flow will be positive. It won't maybe grow is high. We'll have some exposure on sales, but we do see the big tickets kind of go away and they move toward the items that we sell in our properties. And again, I think you asked something about SPARC -- again, it's really just a couple of the brands. It's also going against a great year. And again, let's have a bigger picture view of that business. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Just wanted to ask with regards to the month-to-month leases that are still on the books are a little bit higher than the historical average. Should we expect that to stay there? Or are you still comfortable kind of for higher rents? Or how are you thinking current context? David Simon : Yes. I think that's more a function of documentation than dealmaking in that we don't put that done until signed and a lot of our bigger renewals have been done over the last 2, 3, 4 months, and all that's being documented. So I would expect that, that number would continue to go down, but we have no fear in that number. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Dave, I guess a question on -- a follow-up on the seasonality of NOI in the first half of this year. Second quarter NOI was lower than the first quarter based on supplemental in both periods, which is unusual. How are operating expenses impacting typical seasonality? And what's embedded in the profit this year? David Simon : Yes. We didn't gather your first question. Could you please repeat it? Haendel St. Juste: First question on the impact of seasonality and the sequential NOI for 1Q to 2Q. 2Q looked lower than 1Q, which is unusual. And so I was actually asking how operating income David Simon : I think -- I don't -- see, I don't think the NOI was lower quarter over -- sequentially quarter-over-quarter. You think -- we do have a lot of companies hit in overage rent in the first quarter because their leases end in January 31. And so you pick some of that up in Q1, but that's not -- that would be the only reason. Haendel St. Juste: And on OpEx, any color on how the impacting seasonality or perhaps what's your expectation embedded in the 2% in sort of mentioned David Simon : Again, I'm sorry, but your connection is really not so good. Brian McDade : We're not really seeing much inflation just yet in operating expenses. As you think about us, we've got long-term contracts that protect us from material increases. David Simon : And we did increase our operating expenses $0.05. We did have a negative $0.05 for the quarter there. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question Ki Bin Kim : Just a follow-up on Haendel's question. Your NOI from Klepierre and HBS also increased pretty significantly in 2Q over Q1. Also curious about how much of that is sustainable in a run rate perspective or if there's some onetime items? David Simon : Well, no. Klepierre was shut down last quarter. So this is kind of more -- I mean, last year this quarter. So this is -- they're still not firing on all cylinders, so we'd expect future growth here. So comparing to Q2 of '21 compared to Q2 of '22, Q2 of '21, they were under a lot of restrictions and in some places closed. And HBS is so small. It's insignificant. But there's no real change there. We -- it's a lease that pays a certain amount of rent every month. So it's -- there's no very little growth other than like the normal step-ups. Very small, but the change is. Ki Bin Kim : I actually meant sequentially. That sequentially -- I actually meant that sequentially, it increased by, I think, $10 million as well. David Simon : Well, we did a restructuring. So that's part of it. Brian McDade : And they're doing better, quite honestly. They're announced results in strong results. So I think you're seeing that starting to come through our results as well. Ki Bin Kim : And I'm not sure if I missed it or not, but any kind of commentary you can share on what the lease spreads look like in 2Q? And given that you're close to 94% occupancy, as you continue to increase in that, what kind of pricing power do you expect to gain when you start to reach 95% or 96% occupancy? David Simon : Well, rents are all moving in the right direction and our spreads are moving in the right direction, too. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : On the guidance, original guidance was domestic NOI of 2% growth and year-to-date, it's 5.6%. So is there any update to the 2%? David Simon : As we've said for several years, we do not update that. We give you our best guess at the beginning of the year. It's all part of our plan. We disclosed what we think the number is. Well, we do not update it quarter-to-quarter other than as we've said, we're pretty confident we're going to beat our initial expectations. Linda Tsai : And then can you talk about what you're most focused on from an ESG perspective in 2022? And what are some initiatives where we might see some progress? David Simon : Well, we -- I mean that's a -- I don't have enough time to go through it. But obviously, we're -- it's across the enterprise. And obviously, from an operating point of view, a lot of it continues to be focused on reducing our carbon footprint, but -- and giving back to the communities, which we do in a lot of different ways. But it's a -- that's a very long. Please read our report. If you don't have it, there's a link, I'm sure, Tom can give it to you. But it's certainly focused on -- the big item is focusing on reducing our carbon footprint. Operator : We have reached at the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. I believe that's our allotted time. So thanks for everybody's questions. And any follow-up, please call Tom and Brian. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

[Operator Instructions] I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good morning, and I\u2019m pleased to report our third quarter results. Third quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.97 per share prior to a non-cash unrealized loss of $0.04 from a mark-to-market in fair value of publicly held securities. Let me walk you through some of the variances for the quarter compared to Q3 2021, our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.05 of growth, driven by higher rental income. Our International operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.05, despite the negative currency impact of $0.05 given the strength in the dollar. These positive contributions were partially offset by an $0.11 lower contribution from our other platform investments, which reflects costs associated with the JCPenney launch of new beauty brands, Reebok Integration costs and some softening of sales compared to 2021 from our two value-oriented brands. Domestic property, net operating income increased 2.3% for the quarter and 4.4% for the first nine months of the year. NOI growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the light off of outstanding receivables from Regal Theaters upon its bankruptcy filing. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.2% for the quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months of the year. Occupancy ended third quarter 94.5%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 60 basis points compared to the second quarter. TRG was 94.5%, average base minimum rent increase for the fourth quarter in a row and was $54.80, an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued, we signed nearly 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and have signed over 3,100 leases for more than 10 million square feet through the first nine months of the year. And we continue to have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. The opening rate on our new leases has increased 10% since last year, or roughly $6 per lease. Reported retail sales momentum continued. Our shopper remains resilient. We reported another record in the third quarter of $749 per square foot for the malls and outlets, which was an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mills ended up at $677 per square foot, a 15% increase. TRG was $1,080 per foot, 25% increase. Our occupancy cost is at 12%, which is a level not seen since early 2015. We opened our 10th premium outlet in Japan and started construction on a significant expansion at Busan and South Korea. Our redevelopment pipeline is moving forward with more creative projects. Turning to our other platform investments. In the third quarter contributing $0.17 in FFO per share, as compared to $0.28 in the prior year period. After cash distributions received, we have approximately $475 million of net investment within our other platform investments primarily an ABG and RGG. We expect to generate approximately $300 million in FFO from OPI, that is for those of you like math is a 60% return on investment. We believe the value of our investments in OPI is over $2 billion. We've recently announced our strategic partnership with Jamestown, a global real estate investment and management firm. We see great opportunity with this investment to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses. The Jamestown team, our experienced, mixed-use operators, developers, property managers and asset managers, we're pleased to expand our investment platform with this best-in-class operator and we expect to grow their asset management business and accelerate our densification opportunities. We anticipate this accretive transaction to close prior to the end of this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 16 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year for a total of $1.8 billion, at an average interest rate of 4.78%. Our balance sheet is strong, with approximately $8.6 billion of liquidity. Net debt-to-EBITDA is at 5.7 times and our fixed charge coverage is over 5 times. Today, we announced a 9.1% increase in our common stock dividend, and we will pay $1.80 per share for the fourth quarter. The dividend is payable on December 30th. Since May, we have purchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $98.57 per share. Given our current view, for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.70 to $11.77 per share, to $11.83 per share to $11.88 per share, compared to $11.44 last year. So that's an increase of 13% at the bottom end of the range and $0.12 at the midpoint and an increase of $0.26 at the midpoint compared to our initial guidance for the year. This guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. Now, just let me conclude by saying, we had another impressive quarter. And before we get to questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you. For nearly 30 years as a public company, like many companies and industries, we have dealt with significant shifts within our industry. In our case, we embrace new challenges, and are better operators and more thoughtful and astute capital allocations \u2013 allocators. Many have tried to kill off physical retail real estate and in particular in closed malls. And I need not remind you, when physical retail was closed in COVID, all the naysayers saying that physical retail was gone forever. However, brick and mortar is strong -- brick and mortar retail are strong and ecommerce is flat lining. And importantly, over this period of time, we have paid out $39 billion in dividends to shareholders, as we have become stronger and more profitable. And why do I bring this up constantly? Well, because hopefully, this will put an end to the so-called negative mall narrative as you can't pay those dividends without a strong underlying business. Now, operator, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning, David. It's nice to see the occupancy continue to climb and I know minimum base rents are up 1.7%. And you did mention in your comments that new lease rates were up 6% - or $6 sorry, per foot. Can you just kind of provide any color on how leasing spreads are trending? And do you envision bringing that metric back perhaps early next year? Just any thoughts around that? David Simon : Yes, they are -- when you do comparable space, they're wildly positive. Steve Sakwa : Can you just provide any more color? David Simon : Well, I just -- we don't report spreads, but they're wildly positive when you focus on comparable space. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Good morning out there, David. Hey, so, one, appreciate the continued disclosure of the different platforms, the core, the International, Klepierre and the brands. But my question is, just given continued inflation, obviously, energy grown more of a concern, can you just help us understand when we hear or see like retailer brand earning contribution is down, or we read about different retailers having issues, how that translates, if at all, to their leasing? Because I think one of the questions that certainly comes up, is, hey, retailers have a bad print, oh, that's negative for the landlords. But that doesn't seem to be the case of accepting maybe certain circumstances. So, is there a general insight that you can help us understand that when the retailers have a bad quarter or a bad print, what the impact, if at all, that you see on the leasing side? David Simon : Sure. I would say, this is something we monitor every single day, in good times, bad times, mediocre times. We have yet to see any pullback in opening new stores or renewals. So, there's been absolutely no impact. And you're always going to have a deal here or there that falls apart for all sorts of different reasons, but nothing based upon the macro conditions. And I would tell you, Alex, that where -- they're seeing most of the pressure is in the e-commerce business. So the flight toward bricks and mortar is real. It's going to be sustained. And if they're in the retail business and they want to grow, they're going to open stores. And it's that simple, because the returns on e-commerce just aren't quite what everybody talks about. And so I think you've seen that and we've seen no slowdown whatsoever, there's always going to be a deal here or there. But if they're growing retailer, they have to put the money in bricks. Highest return on investment, we understand it as well as anybody because we see the e-commerce business, not just in the brands that we own with ABG, but also at Penney and RGG. And it's been a difficult year for e-commerce and bricks is where the action is. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Good morning. David, you've been doing this a long time. How do you\u2026 David Simon : Yes, you're right about that, you're right about that. Derek Johnston : Yes, sir. But how do you and the team feel headed into holiday? The consumer seems okay. But certainly, we're facing a slowdown, high inflation, it's hitting interest rates. So I mean, what really keeps you optimistic on your retail investments and then also on the holiday overall and it being a solid season? David Simon : Well, look, you're always, as any kind of CEO, you're always worried about the macro environment. But I will tell you what gives me unbelievable confidence going into the next few years is, the realization that - what we have been saying is that don't underestimate physical retail. And it\u2019s kind of repetitive what I said earlier, but I'll just reinforce. We feel really good because physical retail is where the action is. That's where the return on investment is. And so even though if we may slow down next year or even into the holiday season, I don't think the growth from our existing business is going to slow down because the demand for new deals and space is there. On the retail side, I -- we're trying to -- one is I don't want to make a huge deal out of it. Two, is I want people to understand we've made an unbelievable investment. So we're getting a 50% return on our net investment there. So if it goes to 70% or it goes to 50%, it's -- we are going to have volatility, but it's still the hell of an investment, still being a great thing for us to do, to not only understand but what it takes for retailers to be successful, but kind of where the future is. So there will be volatility in that, but our better brands in there like Brooks Brothers, Lucky Jeans, Monica, really doing well. I said to you on the last call, the lower income consumer is tightened their belt and we do have a few brands that are affected by that. But even with that said, we have an unbelievable return on investment after tax from the earnings that those businesses throw off. And we're also making investments in that -- in those businesses. So, I expect those investments to pay for future earnings growth. But the macro is concerning, but look, rates will have an impact is probably the most direct impact that we'll have next year. But I still feel like demand and bricks and mortars where the action is going to be. Operator : Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Quick ones, if I could sneak them in. The first is just on the occupancy gain is pretty impressive this quarter. I think you talked about maybe getting to pre-COVID occupancy by 2023. Just how are you thinking about sort of the upside on occupancy in this portfolio at this point? The second one was just on the new disclosure in the supplemental is really helpful on the fixed versus variable. Just any color or any comments as you're converting these variable leases to fix? How is that going? How much is left to go? What's the economics look like? Would be helpful. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Let me -- I'll take the last one. I mean, we expect to garner a lot of the percentage and overage rent to minimum rent as these leases roll, but they take time to roll over. And our average lease term is probably 7 years. So it's not going to happen overnight, but it will happen over time. And remind me your first question? Occupancy. Thank you. So Look, I think we're still on track to achieve our goal -- I mean, I -- frankly, I think we've done an unbelievable job in increasing our occupancy and increasing our cash flow since the shutdowns. So hopefully, in '23, we'll get back to pre-COVID levels. Operator : Our next question is from Vince Tibone of Green Street. Please go ahead. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. Could you elaborate on how you expect to grow Jamestown's Asset Management business? And could you see that platform being acquisition vehicles, U.S. malls or Simon's the operating partner and how minority stake in the fund or investment? David Simon : It's really in the asset management business. So I don't see it buying -- I don't see buying malls in that platform under any circumstance. But they have a lot of institutional relationships as do we, and we think, our working together, we'll be able to separate account money to invest in kind of the opportunities that exist in real estate. They're great place-making real estate. So there'll be some of those opportunities. They are also historically a big German fund operator. We expect them to continue that and they look for opportunities both internationally and domestically, not in our core business, but in other forms of real estate. So I think between essentially kind of the historical separate account business. They have their premier fund, plus their German fund business and then our adding to that platform in terms of owning 50% of the business. I think it will be attractive for institutional and retail investors, not retail real estate investors, but retail investors to potentially want to have Jamestown invest in real estate form. Vince Tibone : That's really helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks. David, I was heartening to hear you talk about the benefits of physical real estate over e-commerce, your perspective is always much valued on those. You have better insight call on that than anybody in the industry. And obviously, sales records, tenant sales records, leasing remains strong. I guess the question I have for you is, last quarter, I think you said your SNO pipeline was around 200 basis points. Is that still the case? Because you're signing new leases as well as opening stores? And then when do you think you're going to be able to achieve 19 levels of NOI on a same-store basis? David Simon : Well, look, I -- we're pushing the group to achieve that next year. And Floris, I would say to you the biggest issue for us next year will be just getting our pipeline open. And a lot of these are really good retailers with really good stores, and it takes time to build them and open them. So that will be our challenge. That will be our primary challenge to reach next year's to get back to '19 levels. But I'm hopeful that we can do it, and we are pushing very hard to do that, which is, I think, pretty much ahead of schedule. It's a very fair and good question to ask that because I ask that every single day. So you and I are on the same page. On the pipe. Brian McDade : Yes, Floris, this is Brian. We're still running about 200 basis points. We've added stuff and we've taken stuff out as we opened, but we're running around 200 basis points consistently. Floris Van Dijkum : In the malls and the outlets relatively unchanged? Brian McDade : Yes. Very consistent. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Craig Mailman of Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : This is Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just on the Jamestown strategic partnership. What was the price and valuation for the deal? And then do you expect to move more into asset management? And if so, how large could that platform become? David Simon : The first part was what? How big would the -- what I'm not sure. When did you -- you broke up there. Tom Ward : Can you repeat your question? Nick Joseph : For the Jamestown deal. David Simon : Yes -- we're not disclosing the private company, and we both chose not to disclose it. So I think you asked the size of the deal. I'm sorry, Craig, you're breaking up some. I'm guessing that's what you've asked. They manage roughly $13 billion of assets across their various funds. And we are hopeful that over time, it's not just quantity, but there is quality involved, but there's no reason why we can't turn that into one of the bigger asset management players with their expertise and our expertise combined, their reputation and our reputation combined, we think it will be an attractive platform to raise additional funds to invest in real estate. And I am hopeful that we can more than double it. I'm not going to put a number out there, but we didn't do it to be flat. We did it because we expect to grow their assets under management. And given the existing size, we think we can grow it with time pretty significantly. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi David, on your comment about wildly positive leasing spreads, I guess, how recent of a dynamic is that where you would, I guess, describe them as being wildly positive? David Simon : I would say it really started at the beginning of this year. So look, we -- again, spreads -- ultimately, you see it in our minimum base rent growth. So -- but that's a huge -- that's everything. So it takes time. But if you -- and again, we want you to focus on cash flow growth as opposed to spreads. But if we were to track comparable space, space leases to same space, it would be wildly positive, more than the $6 per foot that I mentioned. But we don't then we don't want you to like be obsessed with that either. So, we're trying just to focus everyone on occupancy, minimum rent growth, we've outlined kind of where we get the variable income where we get our contractual income. It's all in the 8-K, and it all manifests itself in the NOI. And that's what we want you to focus on. But if you were to take the subset, which is space for space that's like it's pretty damn impressive. And our renewals are positive overall. And so that's changed. That you're right, over the last certainly in COVID we got -- those renewals were tough that happened to show up during COVID. But I am happy to report renewals generally and new deals with ending space and new space is wildly positive and that's manifesting itself in our comp NOI growth. Then you add that to the pipeline, and that's why we feel good about next year. But unfortunately, the only negative next year will be getting stores open and getting this 200 basis point type open and operate. And that takes time because the retailers that we're doing business with want to have the proper looking, they want to have a proper look in store. But we are very pleased to see the spread story change. Michael Mueller : Okay, thanks, David. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Craig Schmidt : Great. Thank you. Will Simon's total investment in redevelopments and developments grow in 2023 or might macro events like a potential recession cause a pause in new projects? David Simon : Yes. That's a good question, Chris. Right now, we think the -- if we do run into a recession, actually, from the standpoint of new projects, actually, we see a slight benefit. They sound counterintuitive, but construction pricing for new projects is higher than what we want to see. So I'm hopeful that any slowdown will demonstrate will reduce cost of new construction, which we will then want to like move forward more aggressively. So it's kind of counterintuitive. But again, I'm not looking forward. I don't want to recession. I hope there's not a recession, but from the standpoint of redevelopment and new development, we actually -- the counter cyclicality of cost of construction may actually be one of the side benefits that we can take advantage of. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. I was just looking at the lease income disclosed in the supplemental for the consolidated properties. And it seems like that was up 60 basis points year-over-year, but your domestic NOI was up 2.3%. So I'm just -- and at the same time, it was \u2013 that lease income was down modestly sequentially. So just hoping for a little bit more of an explanation, I guess, or tying to lose sense as to the difference between the lease income and then the NOI reported? And is it cost controls or any other kind of unusual items that kind of drove that disparity between the lease income growth and of course NOI? David Simon : Yes. I think you had less -- we had a reduction in overage rent, right, would be one of the reasons. So that's another trend. Juan, don't forget, we mentioned that we took a charge for the legal write-off and to reduce that line item as well in the current quarter. And then we do have certainly cost containment, as you can see through the P&L. So all of that mixed together drove the levers to higher NOI growth. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good morning. If you could just please touch on the reduction in overage rent again and how much of that is driven by, one, reduced sales despite kind of tenant sales being up 14% year-over-year? And then otherwise, the conversion of pandemic leases back to fixed and then maybe how much more of that kind of conversion we expect to see this year and into next year? David Simon : Well, we -- look, I mean strategy-wise, we always try to convert our overage rent into minimum rent. So you -- certainly, some reduction is associated with it. And then usually '21, obviously, on sales was pretty strong. And in certain cases, percent rent where we -- it's not so much the overage say, the percent of rent, we have some tenants that are just purely percent rent. They've had slower sales since '21, and that's showing up in the numbers. But -- we're still very pleased with the results. So I think those are kind of the big picture. We'll continue to reduce percent in overage rent as leases roll over. On the other hand, our sales are rising and the retailers focused on the higher-income consumer continue to spend, and that's good for us as it shows up in our cash flow. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The domestic property NOI increased 2.3% in the quarter. The portfolio increased 3.2%. That's a deceleration from last quarter about 130, 140 basis points, but it sounds like there's an offset of 100 basis points from the Regal write-off. So maybe like a 30 to 40 basis point slowdown. So from the last quarter, so I guess -- the question is, is this like the right rate of portfolio NOI growth that we should expect kind of going forward? Or is there an expectation that things kind of continue to moderate from here? David Simon : Well, again, I wouldn't focus too much on quarter-over-quarter. There is volatility in our numbers because of overage rent and other factors, layoff like Regal, which is highly unusual that it would manifest itself in a material number, but it's important to point out. So look, I think you have to go back to the beginning of the year where we thought because '21 was a really banner year, and we were very conservative in our comp NOI estimate of 2%. We're blowing through that number. We'll see what the fourth quarter brings. But it's -- our comp NOI growth is going to be really strong, and we continue to expect it to grow next year as well. So you've got to look at this over 2- or 3-year period as opposed to quarter-over-quarter or even year-over-year. And we're making a tremendous amount of progress a number we were one of the few industries that were literally mandated the shutdown, and we're kind of back up and running and producing results that are pre-pandemic, which is very good to see. And we'll expect to see comp NOI growth next year even in the face of a potential recession. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi, good morning. In terms of the write-off from Regal, is this for all your Regals? And are they rent reductions or rejected leases? David Simon : This is all of our Regal. We took a reserve against outstanding receivables. Linda Tsai : So what would happen -- it's still going to operate as Regal or ... David Simon : Well, we don't know. I mean you're in bankruptcy, we -- my guess is they'll come out of bankruptcy as it's an ongoing business, but we have to wait and see. I'm sure they're going to restructure the debt. We're experts in understanding bankruptcies, but I would imagine they'll reward and some of this may come back as its pre-petitioned. So in order for them to assume a lease. They have to clear up to the pre-petition rent. So it gets very technical and complicated. There's trade-offs, we'll just have to see how it goes through bankruptcy at this point. And -- but I expect them to continue to operate. There could be a couple of theater closures in our portfolio. Some of that will be fine. And -- but we have yet to have a -- I think their debt and financing is, I think, just about approved or was approved. So it's going to go through a process that we've -- we have seen hundreds of times. Operator : Next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. So just want to go back to your comments about the lease spreads looking pretty positive this quarter. If you take a step back to look at and look at it on a kind of net economic basis, meaning regardless of is it minimum rent or income from percentage deals, as you're signing new deals, how does the net economic benefit look like versus the comments you made about the lease spread looking positive? And what do you think that looks like going forward? Tom Ward : Stephen, can you repeat your question? You are breaking up a little bit. Ki Bin Kim : Sure. David Simon : Yes. It was really, sorry [indiscernible]. Ki Bin Kim : Yes. Is this better? David Simon : Yes. Thank you. Yes. Ki Bin Kim : Yes. So just talking about the lease spreads, you guys mentioned that the spreads were pretty positive this quarter. I'm just curious about the net economic impact of the renewals or new leases meaning as you convert some of the percentage deals into fixed, is the net economic benefit you're getting as good as the comments you made about spreads looking pretty positive? David Simon : Well, sure. I mean it's -- yes, because we obviously take into account our existing income stream from that space, which includes if we have average 1% rent. And we're -- we look at it in totality but we expect the total income stream to go up. And coding tends to be minimum rent increase and some assumption on overage. That's why rent spreads are kind of whatever you -- whatever you want it to be. That's why we chose not to do it. So as an example, our -- when we disclosed it historically, we included everything. We had minimum rent against minimum rent. We did not factor in overage. Well, Taubman as an example, when they did their rent spreads, they included some assumption on overage. Well, when they disclosed it to their rent spreads, is that beneficial or not beneficial. I mean, to the -- so to me, it's like, hey, it all shows up in cash flow man, so you see the cash flow, see the NOI. So, that's why you guys be very careful with rent spreads. That's why they're more manufactured than they should be. They're in some cases, take assumptions and whether you want assumptions or not, we'd rather not have assumptions. So we just say, here's the math. Minimum right, you see our overage, see the NOI next question. So -- but when we look at our -- when we go lease space by space. We're looking at the total income stream before and after the renewal or in the case of a new tenant to see whether we're going up or down or it's flat. And what I'm telling you is the trend is up pretty straightforwardly. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Great. And you guys mentioned that the lease percentage for your portfolio is about 200 basis points higher than that 94.5. I'm just curious if you look at the forward leasing pipeline of new deals that you're looking at as we head into next year, what does that picture look like compared to maybe a couple of quarters ago? And tied to that, I also noticed your 2023 lease expirations didn't really budge all that much quarter-over-quarter. Just like any kind of preliminary thoughts on that role? David Simon : Yes. The stuff out there, we're very close to some of the larger accounts just takes time to do renewals, paper and all that stuff. So that's all moving not no real concerns there. Go ahead, Brian. Brian McDade : And Ki, you said there about the 200 basis points. Let me just clarify. That is included within the current occupancy level. It is space in the leasing that has been done but hasn't commenced paying rent. So that is next year effectively will be partially next year's growth. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Operator : Our last question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Good morning. I have a question, a follow-up for you on the leasing. The occupancy is up 170 basis points year-over-year, but your lease income is only up about 60 basis points. My question is, when are we going to see the impact of that that occupancy gain. Is that part of the cautious optimism embedded in your thinking for next year and your hopes for getting back to 2019 at levels or that be more of a full year '24 impact? David Simon : Well, I think you've seen it, and you'll continue to see it. So our comp NOI growth the first 9 months is 4.4%. So you've seen it for the first 9 months, 4.4% growth. And then as Brian mentioned earlier, and I have mentioned throughout the call, is we had this other pipeline that's basically leases that will open and start paying commencing rent in 2023. And that's why we're positive about the feeling that we'll continue to have future comp NOI growth for next year, even in the face of potential recessionary environment, okay? Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. And I guess as a follow-on to that, if we assume expenses have to go up given what's going on with inflation and operating expenses, personnel, is it your expectation that you can grow NOI between the fourth quarter year and middle of next year? David Simon : Absolutely. That's what I -- yes, we said we expect comp NOI growth next year. And obviously, that includes the expense side as well. Haendel St. Juste: Right, right. I was thinking more than 6 months. But nevertheless, one more if I could squeeze in for Brian. Maybe it's a bit follow-up, but the $600 million of unsecured maturing next June, bearing interest in 2 and 3 quarters. What's the early thinking there? And where do you think you could issue 10-year unsecured today? Brian McDade : Sure. Look, we actively monitor markets at all times, and you've seen us numerous times react ahead of maturities or at maturity. So we would expect to continue to keep our pulse on the finger of the market. Unsecured today is approximately 6% for us. Haendel St. Juste: Great. Thank you. David Simon : All right. You can sneak in a few extra questions there. I think that was it on the question side. So thank you. It's a change of pace to it in the morning, but we did it in hopes that you got home early enough to trick or treat. And hopefully, you have a great Halloween. So thank you, and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to 1 question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good evening from Phipps Plaza, where we recently completed our transformation, including a new office building, a new Nobu Hotel and a Life Time resort. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results. We generated approximately $4.5 billion in FFO in 2022 or $11.95 per share. On a comparable basis, full year FFO per share was $11.87, an increase of 3.8% year-over-year. We returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and shares. And total dividends today paid since our IPO now totals approximately $39 billion. We invested approximately $1 billion, including accretive development projects and expanding our other investment platform into the growing asset and investment management businesses with our Jamestown partnership. These consistent strong results are testament to the quality of our portfolio, a relentless focus on operational and cost structure, disciplined capital allocation and our team's commitment to our shoppers and communities. Fourth quarter funds from operations were $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net gain of $0.25 per share, principally from the sale of our interest in the Eddie Bauer licensing JV in exchange for additional equity ownership in Authentic Brands Group, Authentic. We now own 12% of Authentic valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2021. Our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.23 of growth, driven primarily by higher rental income and with some lower operating expenses. These positive contributions were partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.03 at a $0.15 lower contribution from our other platform investments. 2021 was a great year for our retailers. However, in 2022, Forever 21 and JCPenney were affected by inflationary pressures and consumers reducing their spend. Despite not achieving the same profitability that we did in 2021, we are pleased on how we and the management teams dealt with the unanticipated external environment. Turning to domestic property NOI. We increased 5.8% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 6.3% for the quarter and 5.7% for the year. Occupancy for malls and outlets at the end of the fourth quarter was 94.9%, an increase of 150 basis points compared to prior year and an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. Renewals occupancy was 98.2%, and TRG was 94.5%. Average base minimum rent was $55.13 per foot, an increase of 2.3% year-over-year. For the year, we signed 4,100 leases for more than 14 million square feet. Over 2 years, we've now signed 8,000 leases for more than 29 million square feet, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline that will open for a late 2023 and 2024 openings. Reported retailer sales momentum continued. We reached another record in the fourth quarter at $753 per square foot with the malls and outlets combined, an increase of 6% year-over-year. All platforms achieved record sales levels, including the mills, it's $679 per square foot which was a 5% increase. TRG was $1,095 per square foot, an 11% increase, and our occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 12%. We opened a new development in 2022, our 10th premium outlet in Japan. Construction continues, our new outlet in Normandy, France, west of Paris. This will be our second outlet in France and our 35th international outlet. Our international outlet platform is a hidden jewel for SPG. As a frame of reference, it is bigger and much more profitable with much higher sales per square foot than another public company's portfolio. We completed 14 redevelopments, and we will complete another major redevelopment project this year at some of our most productive properties. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on 6 to 8 mixed-use projects. All of this will be funded with our internally generated cash flow. Now turning to other platform investments in the fourth quarter, it contributed $0.23 per share in FFO compared to $0.38 in the prior year period. For the year, OPI contributed $0.64 in FFO compared to $1.07 in the prior year. We are pleased with the contribution from our OPI investments, especially given our de minimis cash investment we've made in these companies. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed refinancing on 20 property mortgages for a total of $2.3 billion at an average interest rate of 5.33%. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. Our fixed coverage ratio is 4.8x, and we ended the year with approximately $7.8 billion of liquidity. In 2022, we paid approximately $2.6 billion of common stock dividends in cash. We announced $1.80 per share this quarter, which is a 9% increase over the same period last year. The dividend is payable at the end of March -- at the end of this quarter, on March 31. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $98.57 in 2022. Moving on to '23. Our comparable FFO guidance is $11.70 to $11.95 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions : domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%; increased interest expense compared to 2022 of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 per share, reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions; similar OPI investment contribution, FFO contribution compared to 2022; the continuing impact of the strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and the yen; no significant acquisition or disposition activity; and a diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. To conclude, we had another excellent year, effectively navigating external headwinds that included rising interest rates, strong U.S. dollars, inflation and a somewhat softening economy. We have consistently posted industry-leading results through our hard work, innovation, great people and great assets, and we are -- continue to be excited about our plans for 2023. If you come to Atlanta, you will see what we're doing, and it's a great example of the future growth prospects of our company. And will now allow for Q&A. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Just starting with the guidance of at least 2% sort of organic growth next year, obviously, occupancy is already back to 95%. Just a little bit more color on that. How much of that is occupancy gain? How much of that is rent bumps? Just trying to get a sense of what's driving that. David Simon : Well, I think it's all the above. It's rent bumps, it's occupancy gains. We still -- and this is very important to underscore. We still have a lot of openings scheduled for the latter half of '23 and the early part of '24. So we're not going to see the full contribution of those tenants open until essentially really a run rate at '24, I'd say, sometime in '24. Now you ask why? Well, because we have a high-quality group of retailers opening in these, and it takes a while to build out their quality stores. But it's occupancy gains, it's rental -- it's spread increases. It's a reduction in our temporary tenant income because we're leasing space permanently. And it's basically assuming that -- a lot goes into this, but it's basically assuming relatively flat sales. Now if you remember last year, we said up to 2%. This year, we obviously blew past it. It was total for the domestic properties at clearly 5%, roughly 5%, 4.8%. So we're hopeful we'll do better. But again, we still have to make assumptions and that's why we like where we're at. And the biggest assumption that is somewhat of the unknown sales. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I guess as you think about your other platform investments and some of the monetizations that you talked about with Authentic Brands, how do you sort of think about those on a go-forward basis against maybe making new investments in new retailers that may be struggling at this time? David Simon : Well, we have a unique relations, relationship with Authentic. That's a very important partnership, so to speak, both as a big shareholder, but also we're 50% owners together, 50% for us, 50% for Authentic in SPARC. And we have a different ownership structure with JCPenney. We don't really have any plans to -- for SPARC to buy additional retailers. We're very opportunistic on that. We had a very busy year last year with Reebok, where SPARC became the operating -- domestic operating partner for Reebok. More -- a very complicated deal. As you remember, we've had -- depressed earnings. We mentioned that to you early last year, that it did depress earnings because we had -- we knew we had some losses to occur this year. So hopefully, we'll be past that this year. But we really don't have any plans to acquire anything. If we do, it will be opportunistically. And just to -- we really -- we've done our -- most of our work has been with -- on the bankruptcy front or where somebody wanted to unload a business. And -- but generally, there's not a lot of distress in retail right now. I'm not saying it won't develop in the year. But there are some brands out there that are in trouble that obviously people know about. But we don't see playing in any of those situations. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Can we get a more granular update on Phipps Plaza? The repositioning has been open for, I'd say most, or at least part of 4Q. So I guess how is it tracking versus plan? What changes in traffic are you seeing? Or any notable change of in-line rents? Any dates would be appreciated. And then I guess lastly, the project seems to have increased your plan for accelerating some other mixed-use endeavors, I guess, with Jamestown, any more information would be helpful. David Simon : Yes. So it really just opened. So the hotel opened at the end of October, November, but it's really new. The office -- literally, the first tenant just moved in January, mid-January. We just did a tour of that. We still have a lot of lease up. Just to give you a rough number, pre-investment, Phipps stood in the low 20s of NOI. We think it will be stabilized close to 60. And we'll have invested around $350 million in it over that period of time. So again, we don't -- we're a big company. We don't really get into like granular detail, but we basically increased the NOI by about $35 million. Remember, this was a Belk department store. So in the Belk department store, we couldn't lease up that wing. We now have a plaza that has been created external. We announced Herm\u00e8s opening into the Plaza and part of the wing that really was difficult to lease with Belk as the anchor. We have an unbelievable Life Time resort. If you haven't seen what they build or their product, both with Life Time Work, the pool and the restaurants and the services and the salon and, obviously, all the fitness activities, I'd encourage you to do so. And we have a Class A plus office, the best in Buckhead that just opened. So again, low 20, 60, $350 million investment is the math. Now again, we're doing -- and you mentioned Jamestown. Jamestown investment is in the investment and asset management business. So these mixed-use developments that I mentioned in my call text, the 6 to 8, we're doing all of those with -- by ourselves or with partners that we've used before. So that really isn't with Jamestown. Again, we looked at the Jamestown relationship, future endeavors that we can do together or in partnership, but we're very active in building out our platform now. And Seattle as an example, we're about to start a residence in a hotel, which finally got approved, and that's going to start construction. We can go through the list. But all that, Simon Property Group owned just like Phipps, which we own 100% of. Nobu, we own, obviously. The Life Time it was a lease and then the office building we own, too, which is all 100% owned asset. So I don't want you to confuse those 2. But that's the rough math on Phipps. And then the true lease up of Phipps, again, which goes back to the -- my earlier comment on the NOI. The true lease-up effects because you have -- you see Malone and some of the high-end brands building out their stores, it's not a 3-month build. It's, in many cases, 9 months to a year. The true offering that Phipps will have will really show in '24 when all of these retailers open the stores. So Christian Louboutin, Herm\u00e8s and AKRIS and on and on. But most of those will either open late '23 or '24, and that's when Phipps really will be finished. These things don't just -- you don't just flip a switch and it opens. So that gives you a sense of it. And we think the true pro forma of this will ultimately manifest itself in year '25 or even in '26. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : So a question on the retailer brand portfolio and your equity stake in Authentic Brands. You guys have a headwind -- sorry, not a headwind. You guys have a fluctuating contribution from the retailers just based on their actual sales, right? Because it's not rents, it's based on sales. Yet I'm assuming you get some sort of recurring cash flow from the intellectual property that you own in Authentic Brands, managing the brands and all that. So I'm just trying to understand, as you guys sell more of the brand equity and exchange it for a bigger stake of Authentic Brands, how does your income mix switch from being solely sales-dependent to being more consistent, whether it's managing or other sorts of more regular fee income versus volatility from however many jeans or shorts are sold in a given quarter? David Simon : All right. You're introducing -- I'll take you through a tutorial because I like you, Alex, so here we go. SPARC operates the domestic business of the brands Lucky, A\u00e9ropostale, Forever 21, [Eddie Bauer], okay, Brooks Brothers, et cetera. It license the brands from Authentic and it pays a royalty fee to Authentic, and then we, and our partner, Authentic, and it pays rent to landlords, including Simon that will pay rent to -- Forever 21 could be in a Vornado property. In fact, it is in Times Square pays rent to Steve Roth and Vornado. And that business has operating profit. And we share in that 50-50 with Authentic. So we actually, now that we converted and exchanged our license, that we own together. Now we have historically done the license business on a JV basis. We've decided over time to exchange that into stock of Authentic. And that's why we were not a shareholder in Authentic, but eventually it become a 12% shareholder in Authentic through the exchange of our interest in the JV license business, for stock into Authentic. Authentic is a big company. It does $1 billion of revenue, close thereabouts. But it owns the license of many, many brands beyond SPARC. It owns its partnership with David Beckham and its partnership with Shaquille, Elvis Presley, Juicy Couture and on down the list. You can Google it, it will give you all the names, so. But SPARC is essentially the retail operating company. So when you think of SPARC, you should think of it similar to any other retailer like American Eagle or anybody else that operates stores, operate e-commerce, et cetera, it does wholesale. The only difference it pays a royalty to Authentic. It does not pay a royalty to Simon Property Group. So the only vagaries that Simon Property Group has is, in fact, what the operating profits of SPARC are. And in the case of '21 versus '22, the big difference was essentially Forever 21 because that teenage consumer obviously cut back with the rapid increase in gas prices and inflation and the uncertain economic environment. So I know we're not allowed, but can we let Alex -- I'm asking Tom Ward, who's the police of the call, can we ask Alex if he understands this? Okay, Alex. do you understand it? Was I perfectly clear? Alexander Goldfarb : So if I take away what you're saying, SPG lives really on the retail sales and performance, your 12% stake in AB doesn't generate any fees to you? So again, the focus is really the earnings derived purely from sales, there's not any sort of recurring. David Simon : Well, I mean, it's more than -- sure, sales are important, but there's gross margin. They also sell wholesale, okay? So Brooks Brothers does have wholesale accounts. So it's more -- but it generates EBITDA basically through running the business, which includes stores, e-commerce, wholesale, and certain other ventures. Authentic, because we equity account, they're a very profitable company with high gross margins. It's an asset-light company, essentially. We take our share of earnings from them, net income because they are a taxpayer, et cetera. But together, all of those businesses, SPARC, RGG, which is our partnership with Michael Rubin, who owns Fanatics, and Authentic, all of that rolls through OPI. And OPI contributed $0.64 out of $11.87. So it's in that range, to give you a sense. So $0.64 out of $11.85. So -- but that -- hopefully, that helps explain it. Lastly, you got it? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Vince Tibone : Could you provide some color on leasing economics and how those are trending in the current macro environment? Just given current NOI guidance is about 2%, which is lower than average contractual bumps and there should be some occupancy upside, this just seems to imply leasing economics aren't great. But I know it's contrary to what you said on recent calls. So can you just help me better understand kind of the dynamics at play here with guidance and maybe where leasing economics are right now? David Simon : Yes. Look, I would say we have positive spreads across the portfolio in renewals and in new leases versus existing leases for new fixed. And again, we also had operating spend increase because we're not immune to security cost increases, housekeeping, all of that normal operating expenses. To some extent, our fixed and bumps don't cover that. We're also projecting flat sales. Obviously, to the extent that sales outperformed that, we'll outperform as well. And we have these cases when we're adding great retailers and great restaurants to our portfolio, we have to take out the tenant that was, in many cases, temporary, you have to take that out. And you basically have 9 months of downtime where you have no income for it. Now like we did last time, Vince, we said up to 2%. We did 4.8%. I'm hoping to do better. But those are basically the determinants. And that's why we said better than 2%. But we have some operating expense increases, real estate taxes, unbelievably continue even though we're the goose that continues to lay the golden eggs for all of the communities in which we operate, our taxes continue to go up. While we have operating expenses that go up with inflationary pressures, we had downtime. We had flat sales, and we lose temporary income while we're retending and going to physical, whether we're going to permanent income. All of that's great news, but our rent spreads are positive. Renewals are positive. And we -- and that's been the difference. And obviously, we'll throw COVID out. But even the trend prior to COVID, renewals were under customers, you know, Vince. And demand continues to be very good. Vince Tibone : Just one follow-up. Like is variable lease income -- do you expect that to continue to trend down just as you unwind maybe some COVID lease modifications? Or how should we think about that part of the puzzle to going forward? David Simon : We have budgeted it basically down slightly because, number one is the extent that a tenant renews the lease, we're getting some of that overage into the base rent. If you remember out of bankruptcy, Forever 21 pays basically percentage rent to all of its landlords, us included. It had a tough year last year, as I mentioned earlier. And we're budgeting basically flat this year. So there's a lot that goes on that kind of -- you've got to again separate between overage and percent rent. It's a little bit of a crystal ball. There are always retailers that do well, some that slow down. We're pretty good at anticipating who's going to be great, who's not. But we're not the ones -- other than Forever 21, we're not the ones putting the stuff in the stores itself, okay? Forever 21, you can blame it on us, okay? So I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Craig Mailman : David, just you had mentioned Forever 21, JCPenney's managed some inflationary headwinds in their business. I'm just kind of curious, with your purview through SPARC and other investments, just how you think the retailers, that your investors and maybe other tenants that people have concerns about or talked about in the news, are positioned heading into '23 from a gross margin management perspective and just balance sheet. And how much risk you see in this current environment versus maybe the kind of the headline fees that are in the market. David Simon : Right now, we feel really good about our retailers. I think they were very focused on entering '23 with good, clean inventories. We feel like most of them have managed that. I asked my leasing folks all the time any pullback on demand. It's not really happened. So we feel good about that. Demand continues to be generally very strong. And I think they really -- because of the bounce back out of COVID really got the benefit of kind of getting their house in order. So I think on the credit side, we're feeling very comfortable, right, Brian? Yes? Brian McDade : Yes. Watch list has been lower in years. The tenant community rebuilt its financial position during COVID and is coming out of it in a much better place. David Simon : So nothing yet. Obviously, you've got a couple of big names out there, but we really have very little exposure to them. And in some cases, we'd like most of them are boxed and also in strip centers. So the ones that were -- that we have and we like the box at, we think we can do something better with them. So I'd say generally, knock on wood, I think credit side is pretty good and demand is good. And they ran -- they -- December was very spotty for a lot of retailers. On the other hand, after Christmas, most had a really good January. And again, I think the mistake we made, Simon Property Group made is that -- again, SPARC was profitable even with -- even though even it didn't meet the financial results of what -- and again, we shouldn't dwell on this too much because again, $0.64 out of $11.87, $0.64 out of $11.87. But it's important just so we'll do a little vehicle, but we made the mistake that thinking '21 -- we budgeted basically flat to '21. And '21 was for a couple of the brands there, just extraordinarily profitable. We made some tactical mistakes in Forever 21. We brought in a new CEO to rectify those mistakes. She's doing a terrific job. So we're very pleased there. We also are very pleased with JCPenney. It's unbelievably profitable EBITDA. You can see the EBITDA. There are some public filings out there. But it is -- it didn't have the '21 year of '21, but we're very pleased at where that company is positioned. And we're extremely pleased with the management team and all that they're doing to reinvigorate the brand. That means so much to that consumer in those communities. And we're taking a different tack than others that have managed or owned that brand. We're actually reinvesting in that company to make it very important for those communities. So very pleased with how we're positioning Penney. But it had EBITDA -- I don't know if I can disclose it, but it had a lot of EBITDA, okay? So and our partner, Brookfield, we'll let Brookfield take -- we'll let Brookfield announce it if they do their -- I'm kidding. But it was very profitable from an EBITDA point of view. So we're very pleased there with the brands. But we did make the mistake of thinking '21 would repeat. And then obviously, you had a lot of volatility from a macro point in '22 with huge increases in interest rates, huge increase in price, in food and energy cost that the consumer was whipsawed, and we felt the impact of it. It's stabilized now, we believe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Craig Schmidt : Given the China reopening, I wonder if you could outline how these visitors would impact your coastal premium outlets and your dominant coastal malls. David Simon : Well, I think we haven't seen the benefit. But just walking we -- I mean I don't want to get into the kind of the geopolitics of what's going on. But we're -- we think there's a real benefit to our landmark assets that have always been shopped by the Chinese consumer or the Asian consumer. We're starting to see that a little bit, but we're not planning for that to really accelerate in '23 but we're hopeful that it will. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Floris Gerbrand Dijkum with Compass Point. Floris Gerbrand Dijkum : David, you had talked last quarter, actually, in response to a question I asked about recovering back to 2019 levels of same-property NOI, which we reckon to be about $6.2 billion. But obviously, that includes -- that does not include some of your retailer investments. But depending on how you slice it, I'm just trying to do the math here, but you're at least $200 million short, even if you include those retailer investments. If you can walk us through -- that would imply that you would get to around 3.7% NOI growth to get back to those levels. So you're clearly not guiding to that yet. You're guiding to 2%. But what are the headwinds, if you will? David Simon : Floris, I think you can -- you really should just focus on domestic. To put the retailers in there, there's too much volatility. It's not something we look to -- we're focused on are domestic property NOI to get back to 2019 numbers before we were shut down by the pandemic. The short answer is we will get there on a run rate by the end of this year. That's the short answer. And you shouldn't put the retailer NOI in there. It's, again, that's -- you've got to remember, we have basically no cash investment in SPARC. So -- and I know we could talk about it all day, but it's -- when you think about Simon Property Group, we want you to think about those investments as it gets with purchase, okay? We get this great property company that owns all those real estate that's redeveloping it, great balance sheet, the ability to make smart investments with an unbelievable return on investment outside its core business. And that's what you get with a seasoned team that's experienced from recession to credit prices to a shutdown in a pandemic, okay? And we managed it through it all. So the bottom line is our domestic property NOI, because of the delay in some of these openings, we will get back on a same property basis. Because remember, the other thing for us, we have properties in and out. So you can't go back in '19, the portfolio is different. But if you do the same portfolio that we own today versus the same portfolio that we own in '19, possible we'll be there by the end of this year, okay? Floris Gerbrand Dijkum : And that would -- and David, that includes -- the $6.2 billion was included your stake in Taubman as well. But I'm just curious because... David Simon : No. We're not including Taubman in it. This is just the domestic property NOI. So we're not even including our international NOI. So what we can give you the mill, if you combine the mills, outlets and malls, domestic portfolio that we owned in '19 and that we still own in '22, we will get there on a run rate by the end of this year. As simple as that we're not that far off, but we have delayed openings. And depending on where sales come in, it's even possible we make it this year. And that's the way to look at it. And that's the only way to look at it, really. Floris Gerbrand Dijkum : I don't disagree. If I can -- the S&L pipeline, has that changed from the last quarter as well? You mentioned some of your spaces opening later in '23 and then '24, obviously, that has the potential to impact your NOI growth going forward by 5% to 7% depending on the rent that you signed, plus your fixed rent bumps. The math that we have suggests that 2% is -- it's the extreme low side of what's probably going to happen over the next 2 to 3 years. David Simon : Yes. I mean certainly, if you look at it over that period of time, call to way outperform -- and again, I just go back to last year. We try to be as thoughtful in doing this, but there are variabilities to it, overage rent being the biggest. But we also have some certain inflationary pressures that we, as landlords and property owners, have to deal with, what I mentioned earlier. And again, you have downtime. But we -- I would hope that we would beat our number just like we did last year. And just like we have historically. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : In the past, you've talked about 80% of the NOI being generated by the top 50% of the properties. Does this remain true? And can you talk about the demand trends and pricing power that you have in the top half of the portfolio relative to the bottom half? David Simon : Well, I don't -- anybody has the percent... Brian McDade : Yes. Michael, that's the whole group. Our top 100 assets generate roughly 80% of our domestic NOI. David Simon : Yes. So it's more than 50%. Brian McDade : It's more than 50%. David Simon : It's more than 50%. So I'd say demand across the board is good. Obviously, the higher end property probably has more demand. And -- but we're generally -- our leases still, to this day, occupancy cost is low and our rent spreads across the board are generally positive regardless of the sales front. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Just a quick one. For your platform investment FFO forecast, are you expecting any significant nonrecurring costs like you had in the 2022 results? David Simon : No. That's a good question and the answer is no. We're not. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: I was hoping maybe you could share some thoughts on deploying capital in the current macro. We noticed you didn't buy back any stock in the fourth quarter. So I guess I'm curious what your level of interest and stock buybacks is here today. And second, I know you mentioned that there's no sizable acquisitions or dispositions in the guide. But I'm curious what your view of the transaction market for malls is, at least today. Clearly, things are still a bit stalled across the board, but there have been a few trades in California the last couple of months. So curious what you think of those trades and if there are any pricing read-throughs. David Simon : Well, I think we're generally pleased that we're seeing some activity in our sector. And it's great that there's others out there that are -- real estate industries that are trying to grow externally. As an example, what was today that was announced. It's good to see we're not the only ones that like to make things happen externally. So that's good. I think our strategy has been essentially confirmed by others, other players in our industry where size and economies of scale see the benefits. So it's always good to see. We saw it in the warehousing world, and we saw it in the -- now we might see in the storage world. So it's great that we see that. From a stock buyback, I think our dividend is really where we're focused growing that. One of the thing I mentioned, hopefully, in my conference text that you heard was we paid out $39 billion in dividends, staggering number when you put it in perspective. That does not include any stock buyback, that's just pure dividends. I'd say that's the, obviously, the focus. But if the stock comes under pressure, we still have the ability to deal with that. So that is in our arsenal. We got a lot of mixed-use properties. I'd say generally, relatively quiet on the acquisition front. We did create our partnership with Jamestown, which we're focused on this year and, obviously, the years to come to grow that relationship. But we've got a lot going on and the capital to continue to create external opportunities. And we've been -- we haven't batted 1,000, but we've certainly moved the needle profitably with our investments and creating unbelievable return on investment, both in the real estate -- still one of the best deals ever done in real estate was our deal on premium outlets, which I'm happy to walk through the math not today. But still one of the best multiple deals ever been in our industry. And at that time, we were widely criticized for it. But one of the best deals done in the public company space. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And I appreciate that. But it sounds like at a high level, not putting words in your mouth, that the focus of your capital investing today is going to be more the redev, less the stock buybacks, less the acquisitions. Question, just a follow-up maybe on the FFO guide itself. I appreciate some of the headwinds, the unknowns, the OpEx, the interest expense, et cetera, but I'm trying to get a sense of what else might be limiting the FFO growth this year, which is basically flat year-over-year versus the 2%, at least. David Simon : Yes, it's really simple. It's interest rate. We're losing roughly $0.30 to $0.35 per share just from either floating rate debt that's now higher or our own assumptions of what our refinancing costs are going to be. The good news is we're refinancing all of our debt. The market is there. but the cost of debt is higher. So that's really if you cut through it all, that's -- and when you look at kind of where the market was, very few analysts updated their numbers at all for higher interest rates. But they -- I don't have to tell you they ballooned over the last 12 months. Haendel St. Juste: No, I appreciate that. I wanted to get a bit of clarity, though, perhaps on bad debt. How are you thinking about that this year within the guide, FX headwinds, maybe at least? David Simon : Yes. I think we got to open it up a little higher. We have a little higher bad debt expense budgeted this year than last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just hoping for a little color on expected CapEx spend just in general for maintenance and then the development spend that we should be budgeting, and what kind of returns or NOI contributions we should be thinking about on the dev readouts stopped -- that would flow through into '23 as we model. David Simon : I will look at our 8-K because the development spend will add to that. But obviously, when you start a real estate project, it's over a, 2-year sometimes 3-year process. So all that's disclosed in the 8-K. And the CapEx, including TA, will probably be roughly with what it was '22, if not a little bit less, okay? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : Regarding the large number of stores opening in late '23 and early '24, what's that expected NOI contribution in GLA, which you attributed to these leases that are signed but not yet been paying? David Simon : At least $100 million. Greg McGinniss : On NOI or -- I guess NOI. Okay. And then is there any contribution expectation from the Jamestown investment? And then if you could talk about like Kl\u00e9pierre that's built into guidance as well. That would be appreciated. David Simon : That all in Jamestown is accretive, but it wasn't a big investment. So -- and so it's in our budget, but it's not really -- the relationship is material, but the financial impact is not material. So that's one. Kl\u00e9pierre, we -- it is consistent with their guidance that they'll be developing when they announced their earnings this -- in the next couple of weeks. Brian McDade : There is some FX headwind still baked in there, Greg, [indiscernible] dollars. David Simon : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Ki Bin Kim : Hope to have a quick one here. So when I look at your 2023 lease expirations, your portfolio still has about 10.5% expiring, which hasn't really budged in the past couple of quarters. I remember from the last call, you said these things can take time, especially with larger national accounts. So I was just curious if you can share an update and how we should mentally think about a realistic set of outcomes here. David Simon : Well, it's -- listen, we're negotiating for the benefit of our shareholders. They're negotiating for the benefit of their shareholders. And a lot of these things we have, what I'll say, handshakes and it's the process of being [tapered]. So you should feel good that there's no smoking gun. There's nothing there that's going to lead to a fall out. It's just a process. And renewals are going We're, in fact, ahead of our '23 renewals now compared to where we were last year, some of the '22s -- and in some cases, because '22 took so long, we're doing '23s, so together and it's a process. But it's going well and relationships are progressing appropriately. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just one quick one. Where should we expect your portfolio occupancy to end up by end of this year? David Simon : '23, slightly up, slightly up. I don't have the number but Brian will have it for you later. Okay, last one, I guess. We're over 6 :00, but we have one more question and one to finish the Q&A. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : On the guidance, the range you provided based on comparable FFO per share in the coming quarters when you have a better sense of mark-to-market gains or losses, will you also show guidance for estimated diluted per share for the full year like you did in prior quarters? David Simon : Yes. Last -- you mean our mark-to-market equity investments? Linda Tsai : Yes. David Simon : Yes, sure. I mean we outlined it. We separate it. We'll do comparable and real numbers. So you'll see both. Hopefully, it will only be up. But last year, we did take a reported FFO. You have the number? What was it? Tom Ward : $0.08. David Simon : $0.08. But we'll outline those for you, Linda so, you'll see them both. Operator : And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to David Simon for closing remarks. David Simon : Thank you. And again, I'm sure there are a lot more detailed questions. Please call Brian and Tom, and we'll be happy to walk you through more details. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I'm pleased to introduce, David Simon. David Simon : Thank you. Good afternoon. And I'm pleased to report our first quarter results. We are off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q1 of 2022. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Our international operations also performed well and contributed $0.02 of growth. These positive contributions were partially offset by declines from the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.02, higher interest rate expense of $0.05, lower lease settlement income of $0.06 compared to Q1 of 2022, and we had a mark-to-market gain on publicly-held securities of $0.06 for the quarter, and a $0.13 lower contribution from our other platform investments compared to Q1 2022. Let me walk you through some of that and remind everyone that for OPI results, we are generally on our plan. Please keep in mind OPI was up against very tough comparisons from last year's Q1. This quarter also includes one-time transaction cost from ABG's recent acquisition activity, JCPenney's deployment of their new beauty initiative, and investments related to physical stores, IT, and one-time reorganization expenses, all flowing through our FFO number. The retailer part of our OPI investments has seasonality associated with it generally with losses in the first quarter and the majority of our profit in the fourth quarter and should be modeled accordingly. Overall, we continued to expect OPI to meet our 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, which is similar -- which will be a similar FFO contribution that was compared to 2022. Now, domestic property NOI increased 4% year-over-year for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 3.9% for the quarter. Our mills, malls, and outlets occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 94.4%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.3%, and TRG was 93.3%. Importantly, average base minimum rent was $55.84 per square foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,200 leases for more than 5.9 million square feet in the quarter. We have an additional 1,500 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $570 million in gross occupancy cost. More than 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We're seeing strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength for many categories. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be approximately 75% complete with our 2023 expiration. Retail sales momentum continued. Reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $759 per square foot for malls and premium outlets combined, an increase of 3.3%. All platforms achieved record sales level, including the mills at $683 a foot, a 2.2%, and TRG was $1,100 per square foot, a 6% increase. Good news is, tourism is returning with our tourist-oriented centers outperforming the portfolio average in terms of sales. Our occupancy cost at the end of the first quarter was 12%. We opened our West Paris Designer Outlet in Normandy, France last week, our 35th international outlet center. During the quarter, construction restarted on our upscale outlet center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which will now open in the fall of 2024. We have several densification projects under construction and a pipeline of identified projects that includes approximately 2,000 residential units and hotel rooms. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We completed a dual-tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.3 billion at a combined average term of 20 years at an average coupon of 5.67%. We closed on our new $5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity in 2028. Importantly, the pricing is unchanged from our prior facility. The traditional secured mortgage markets continued to support the refinancing of our assets across geographies and property types. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9%. The dividend is payable on June 30 of this quarter. Guidance for this quarter -- given the results of this quarter and our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 guidance range from $11.70 to $11.95 per share to $11.80 to $11.95 per share compared to last year of $11.87. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the midpoint, excuse me. And I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent, and brick-and-mortar stores are where shoppers want to be. And even with the economic uncertainty, we are running ahead of our internal plan. Excuse me, here. I have some kind of a frog in my throat, but we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question, Caitlin. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good evening, everyone. Maybe regarding upcoming lease maturities and what that means for potential cash flow changes going forward, the ABR for '23 maturities is around $62 versus the portfolio overall at $56. So, would you think it's fair to say that the rest of the '23 maturities may face a headwind on renewal, but then the '24 maturities, which are 12% of rents and have an ABR of $54, have significant opportunity? I'm guessing it's not that straightforward. So, wondering if you could discuss that rent maturity and mark-to-market outlook. David Simon : Yeah. Thank you, Caitlin, for the question. One of the numbers I threw out there while I was coughing during my presentation was, our renewals and new leases will add $570 million of basically gross rental income. In that is included some renewals, which is the roll-off of the numbers that you quoted. We are renewing above our overall -- above our expiring rents. So, even with that said, we expect to continue to have positive rental spreads even with the higher number for the balance of this year and certainly in '24. So, the outlook on that front is very positive and unchanged since our commentary at the -- certainly at the beginning of this year and fourth quarter of last year as well. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks, good evening, David. David Simon : How are you, Steve? Steve Sakwa : Good. I was wondering if you could just maybe shed a little more light on the leasing demand that you're seeing. Is there anything that you could discuss with us on kind of price point either luxury versus more moderate tenants, anything by region, anything by product type, whether it's the mills, the outlets, or the traditional malls? Just looking for a little color given what we're going through and kind of what your tenants are telling you. Just kind of curious where the strongest demand is and maybe to the extent that there are any weak spots, what would you call out? David Simon : Well, I mean, I know this is kind of in the face of a lot of economic uncertainty, but demand really has not changed one iota. Now, let's talk about the luxuries side. Clearly, they're running up against tough comps compared to Q1 of last year. But those brands and those companies think long-term. And I mean, the best example is, if we were at the opening of Tiffany store in -- on 57th Street, you have to take a long-term view when you open stores like that. And all of those brands whether LVMH Group, Kering, Richemont, et cetera, they're looking at '23, '24, '25, we're -- making commitments. Nothing there is really abated. So all systems go on that front, even though they are running up against tough comps compared to Q1. You look at the restaurant category, very strong demand, lots of new deals across lots of price points from P.F. Chang's, Cheesecake Factory to some of the chef-driven brands. So, all systems go there. You've got the box demand. Lots of new business with Dick's, Life Time Fitness, the best of the best [shields] (ph). Department store demand by [indiscernible] is happening. Then you look at the athleisure, Vuori, ALO, Lululemon, Brooks Brothers, all of that pretty much across the board, we're seeing new stores. So, I said this at the end of last year, early this year, even with -- even though comps are going to be tougher this year in terms of sales compared to last year, the demand on leasing really has not changed. We're seeing the entertainment concepts come back, theatre business is positive. So, we feel it's -- we're feeling very good. Obviously, we're cautious. We don't expect sales like they were over '21 and '22, and we planned accordingly. But demand, we check every day and there's certainly a couple here or there that slowed down, but nothing really noteworthy. VF, North Face, Timberland, Cotton On, they're all growing and it's all pretty healthy. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question, Ronald. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Thanks. I remember last quarter we talked about domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%. You're thinking about looking at 1Q already at 4%, just maybe can you give us an update how you're thinking about that number for the rest of the year? And looking at the guidance raise, how much is that property -- core property NOI versus maybe other factors? Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Yeah, we're going to be 2%. And I would hope we would do at least 3% plus. I mean, there is some -- it's very interesting, the first six months from the retail point-of-view, comps will be tough. But we think the second half for the retailers will be more positive, lots of economic uncertainty out there with the big macro things. But assuming sales come in the way we initially budgeted, we should be hopefully at least 3%. If we have an uptick in sales, we'll do better. Ronald Kamdem : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question, Alexander. Alexander Goldfarb : Thanks, and good evening, David. David Simon : How are you? Alexander Goldfarb : So -- I'm doing well. So, first, thank you for all the detail on the retailer platform and the emphasis on the seasonality, that's helpful. My question is bigger. You guys seem to have a lot of positive trends with the redevelopment program coming back, retailer demand healthy, obviously, some of your competitors are having trouble on the capital side, it strengthens your portfolio. So, my question is, as you look over the next few years to invest incremental capital, is your focus still on the best returns are internal in your existing malls and adding more densification? Or are you starting to see some external opportunities where it may make sense to use capital? And whether that's domestically or abroad? Sort of curious. David Simon : Yeah, I don't see -- let me do it in pieces with no particular order. I do see -- I still do feel strongly that the best use of our capital is making our existing portfolio better and better. I think that we have spent $8-plus billion over the last several years upgrading the portfolio and doing new development. So, we continue to see that as our best use. I don't see -- and as I mentioned in the call, I mean, we have a residential pipeline that looks really attractive in hotels that are generating really good accretive values of around 2,000 units. Now, that's not going to happen overnight, but that's going to happen over the next few years. So that for us is a real opportunity. I don't see much of our external capital doing any kind of acquisition opportunities internationally. I still think we'll grow our International Asia outlet portfolio with redevelopment and new development over time, essentially, recycling the capital, the cash flow that we have there and accretive new development. And where we -- we're looking at everything domestically here and nothing really has -- I think, I could say this wet our whistle here to make us -- I can say that, right? Okay, so nothing here that would... Alexander Goldfarb : You said it. David Simon : Yeah. I said it, true, good point. Nothing here that would really like we're not jumping up and down to do external transaction. So it's mostly the same stuff that we've been doing and just keep plugging away on that. And look, I do think we have to respect the capital markets. The capital markets are telling all companies to be more prudent, to do more accretive investments, and we are listening very closely to that. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vince Tibone from Green Street. Please proceed with your question, Vince. Vince Tibone : Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on your comment regarding the 2,000 residential and hotel units in the upcoming pipeline. Just curious how quickly you could start these projects, how much spend this could potentially represent, and this is something that you're going to maybe do through joint ventures or will be wholly-owned on the balance sheet? Kind of any color on some of these points would be helpful. David Simon : Sure. All right. So, I think we will do selective JVs on certain of the residential development. So, that's -- and it may -- it also may be that we could potentially bring in third-party equity too. So that would -- we'll look at each deal individually, but that's certainly a possibility. And then I think, Vince, essentially, we're looking at to reach all those 2,000 units. It's really probably a five-year build process. We expect to start several this year. But yet, we're, frankly, being a little bit cautious. We're still permitting some things in California and the Northwest. So, we don't -- we're going to just see how the world is, but we don't have to make a decision yet. And I would think, at the end of the day -- rather Brian give you more scientific number, because a lot of these are part of redevelopments too, and so to really isolate the hotel apartment or rental stuff, I'd want to give you a number, but I -- my instinct would be probably about $1.5 billion. But I think Brian can give you more detailed number, but somewhere in that range. And these go from Austin, Texas to Orange County, California to Seattle, some hotels in Florida, some residential in Florida, multifamily. So it's kind of where you'd expect it to be where supply and demand is in our favor. But we're considering building a hotel in Cape Cod, because we think there's a good supply-demand imbalance there. So, it really is across. And every, I'd say generally as we get back real estate through our redevelopment efforts, the big focus is on where we can add some mixed uses, because we do think like what we did in Buckhead is having a tremendous impact on the overall value of that real estate. So, not only does -- is it accretive from a value point of view just on the cost to the return on the build versus what's the value of that is after it's built, but also the residual benefits that we see from them all. Vince Tibone : Got it. No, that's all super helpful. And then, somewhat related follow-up question. Just curious if you could share any updates on the Carson outlet project, and if you think you'd be moving forward there in the near term? David Simon : That's a complicated one. We are -- that's a complicated one, but we're -- every day, we make progress. So, it's terrific real estate, very complicated transaction, but we continued to make progress. But no final decision has been made to do it. But I expect one to be made over the next few months. Vince Tibone : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Mailman from Citi. Please proceed with your question, Craig. Nick Joseph : Thanks. It's actually Nick Joseph on here with Craig. David, just on executive comp and the $24 million one-time cash bonus related to OPI, I know at least one of the proxy analysis firms has raised some concerns on it. So, I was hoping if you could give some more color on both -- rationale behind it in terms of the amount and the structure of it ahead of the vote later this week? David Simon : Yeah, look, I think this was essentially paid '23, '24 executives last February, so about 15 months ago, fully disclosed in an 8-K. Our rationale and reasoning by the comp committee was fully disclosed in our filed proxy as well as supplemental lever to our shareholders. I think if you look at the company in totality, which is important -- I mean, we can always take a moment in time to say why this, why that, but if you look at the history of the company, you look at the executive comp, you look at our stock program, you look at our burn rate, you look at our G&A as a function of our NOI or asset value, we are at the lowest of the low. Anybody can pick up one particular number they don't like. But if you look at it in totality, we are absolutely proud of how we run this business. If you want to get more detail, I encourage you to talk to Head of our Comp Committee or Lead Independent Director, any shareholder can do that. But I would encourage everyone to look at the totality of our history and then come to whatever conclusion they think. And we're very happy to talk to anybody that would like to go through it from a shareholder point of view. Nick Joseph : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Greg McGinnis from Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question, Greg. Greg McGinnis : Hey, good evening, David. I just want to make sure that I understand that $570 million gross rental income number that you mentioned. Is that new and renewal leases? Is it on a pro-rata basis inclusive of international and TRG? How much of that, I guess, is incremental to in-place rents? Or is all of it? And then what's the timeframe [indiscernible] contributing? David Simon : All terrific questions. And we highlighted that just to give you a sense of the scope of the business that's going on here. So that's a huge number. That's just one lease -- one level of activity in a year and it's bigger than some companies that exist today. So, let me try to unpack it. It does include renewals. It's just SPG. It's just domestic. And if you look at the renewals in the new business, there is a really good uptick from kind of the in-place income on that. And that will come in not really this year, but over '24 and '25 as those stores get opened. And I think it just adds a sense of our future growth that we see in front of us from our existing portfolio. But I'm not in a position to break it up between renewals and new incremental business. But you'll see that flow through the NOI in the upcoming quarters. Greg McGinnis : Okay. So, it is both though, because you mentioned $100 million of new income last quarter of new NOI. David Simon : Correct. Yeah, it includes both, correct. Greg McGinnis : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question, Derek. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Occupancy is now at 94.4% and that's just 70 bps below pre-pandemic levels. Do you expect to surpass 4Q '19's 95.1% occupancy this year? And given the leasing demand we've discussed, how is the team weighing occupancy versus rates now that the gap is so narrow? David Simon : Well, let me take that part first. I do think -- the good news is that when we're -- and again every lease is different, every relationship is different, rollovers -- some rollovers go down. But I would say, generally speaking, we are finally seeing renewals that are overall above the expiry rents. So that -- and part of that is just supply-demand is in our favor and we are getting -- because one is, I think, from the retailers' point of view, there is a real appreciation for bricks-and-mortar, one. Two is they know we're a landlord that they can rely on and that we're going to do the right thing to maintain and reinvest in these properties and we have the capability of doing so. And generally, it's more demand that we're seeing, and the retailers are in -- having survived COVID are in better shape and want to grow their business. So that is all happening. And getting into your first point, will we beat it this year? It will be close. I'm not -- I can't guarantee it, but I am hopeful that we will beat that number, in the not -- certainly within the next 12 months, assuming we can continue to maintain reasonably decent economic conditions. Derek Johnston : All right. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Please proceed with your question, Floris. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks. Good evening, guys. David, so maybe, if you can give us a little bit more of an update, I know, in the past you've talked about your signed non-open pipeline being around 200 basis points. Your leased occupancy just increased by 110 basis points. Is that SNO pipeline relatively similar? And then maybe, I mean, the -- if I look at the base rent going up by 3.1% approximately and if you get about 10% of your space back, I mean, it assumes pretty healthy re-leasing spreads, if my math is correct. I mean, how should we be thinking? Clearly, it appears that leasing spreads are accelerating in your core business. David Simon : I think that's a fair statement. And I would say that the pipeline is similar to what it's been. Right, Brian? Brian McDade : Yeah. Floris, we're still hanging right around 200 basis points at this point in the year. David Simon : So, I do think as we've been saying over the last few couple of quarters, I mean, we have finally turned the corner on lease spreads, demand, better properties, more commitments from retailers, more -- and more retailers wanting to open stores, all driving pretty good demand, which allows us to get to spreads that we're accustomed to. But we were flat-lining pre-COVID. Obviously, we got hurt during COVID and we've bounced back nicely. So from that standpoint, it's good to see. Floris van Dijkum : And if I can maybe follow up, David, on Jamestown, and you mentioned external capital. How are you thinking about -- how is the Jamestown acquisition embedding in? And is that potentially a source of external capital that you can bring into some of that -- the apartment or hotel investments, and/or how are the synergies between those two businesses working out, in particular, I'm thinking like Atlanta with the street retail right near your two fortress malls? David Simon : Yeah. Look, to separate, just to be clear. So, we bought into the asset management business and we bought -- we partnered with Jamestown for a couple of -- several reasons, but a couple to highlight here. One is, they're really good asset managers. Two is, they have a development capability that's very interesting to us. And they have excellent institutional relationships. And we think with our partnership, we can grow that business. We did not -- other than -- there is a big future development -- master plan development that they're working on in Charleston where we did partner with them directly. We did not buy any of their existing real estate that's owned by the various funds, whether it's the German funds or the premier fund. Jamestown is in the process of raising their 32nd German fund. They have a lot of separate account interest. It's really good for us, because we get to learn those institutional investors better and more. And I just think we're early days there, but I think the thesis that we had going in, continues to be very, very valid. This is a long-term relationship that I think will grow. Eventually, I see us partnering with institutional money that will be managed by Jamestown that will partner with us to build XYZ or buy XYZ or build a big community in Charleston -- North Charleston. So, yeah, I think all of the elements of potential growth with Jamestown are out there. We do like the asset management business as a platform. We dipped our toe into it. But I think, again, just as we look at the landscape for real estate owners and managers, we think -- when we look at Blackstone, when we looked at our Brookfield, obviously, they own, they asset image for us to have some scale or some role in that business, I think ultimately we will annur to the benefit of the Simon Property Group. And that's what we're after. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks, David. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question, Craig. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Given the seasonality of the OPI business, which quarter do you expect that number to turn positive? David Simon : I think it will be -- no, Craig, you know about retailers. So just to reinforce the retail part of the OPI, remember, the vast majority of the OPI value is in our ABG stock, but we still have a very profitable business with both Penny and SPARC, and then other investments that are in that including RGG and so on. So, just important to put it in context. So the retail part, the pure retailer part, Penny and SPARC, is seasonal. Last quarter, Q1 of '22 was just stimulus whatever was really tough comparison for the retail -- retailer part of OPI. With that said, it will -- we expect it to be profitable in Q2 and Q3. And -- but the vast -- the majority of -- the vast majority of it will be Q4, like all the other retailers. So, when you see retailers report this quarter that are public, I think generally, they'll probably all have tough comps against Q1 of last year. Yes, the comps get a lot easier. This is a lot more information for a business that's -- we have no cash investment remember, and it does create a little volatility of our earnings for better or worse. In this case, this quarter, it's worse, fourth quarter will be much better, does create a little volatility. But it will -- you'll see it map out -- part of that OPI map out just like other retailers where the loss will be in Q1, profitability Q2 and three and then 70% -- 65%, 70% in Q4. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question, Juan. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good afternoon. Just hoping to get a little color on the month-to-month leases, they ticked up from about 4.5% to 7.5% sequentially in the first quarter while you did a fantastic job chopping wood and reducing the rest of the '23 expiration. But just curious on why the increase in the month-to-month basis and what's going on behind that? David Simon : Yeah. One of the comments I made was, we expect to be basically 75% by the end of Q2. It's just a process. It's just -- we're negotiating, the retailers are negotiating, the stores are open and operating. But we -- it's just a typical drawn-out process that is the, so to speak, the art of the negotiation, but a lot of that's already handshake committed to that we're just going through and processing now. Brian McDade : If you look historically, Juan, it's normal seasonality of that line items at this point time of the year. Juan Sanabria : Great, that was my follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Mueller from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question, Mike. Mike Mueller : Thanks. I was wondering, has there been any notable change in lease duration for what you're signing so far in 2023 compared to last year? David Simon : Not really. Not at all. Mike Mueller : Okay. That was it. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel Juste : Hey, good evening. David, I think earlier you mentioned that new leases were 25% deal volume in the first quarter. I guess, I'm curious if that's why CapEx picked up 8% in the quarter. And if this is also a new level -- new versus renewal leasing that you should expect near term? Thanks. David Simon : We have a tough connection. Did you guys hear that? Brian McDade : Haendel, can you repeat your question, please? You kind of broke up a bit there. Haendel Juste : Sure. Sorry about that. So my question was on, David, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that new leases were 25% of the deal volume in the first quarter. So I'm curious if that's why CapEx was up I think 8% in the first quarter. And also if this level of new leases, 25% or so would be kind of the right way to think about new versus renewal leasing going forward? Thanks. David Simon : Yeah, I think -- I guess on the TA line, there is some -- we are doing more deals. So there is probably more TA associated with it. So I'm not sure the CapEx line or you are looking at the TA line. But generally, the answer is yes, we're doing a lot more new business and in some cases that does mean a little bit more TA. And I still had a hard time on the last part. Did anybody hear it? No, we didn't hear -- unfortunately, we didn't hear it, but if you want to call back with that, we're happy to answer that. Operator : Thank you. Moving on to the next question. The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, good afternoon. Going back to your comments on international tourism, David, can you remind us where international tourism levels are for your portfolio today versus, let's say, pre-COVID? And if it should return to that normal level, what does that mean for Simon's NOI or earnings, however, you want to look at it? David Simon : Well. I would say, generally speaking, we -- just to give you a sense, our sales for our tourist properties that we identify was up 8% quarter-over-quarter, right, generally? Brian McDade : Yes. David Simon : So, the bottom line is, it is really going to result in overage rent that we've probably flat-line more or less on those properties. So -- and that will manifest itself once we reach the breakpoint, so later in the year. But we're seeing -- we're starting to see, I mean like Vegas, we have our tourist property in Florida, which has been pretty strong, but we're seeing more and more international tourism there. Woodbury, here in the New York area -- I'd say, here in Indianapolis, but in the New York area, is really starting to see a lot more international tourism. California has been kind of the weak link. But we're starting to see more and more sales there. And then, Vegas is just going crazy. Vegas -- we -- and we have really important exposure in Vegas between Forum and Crystal, our two outlet centers. Vegas is as good as it gets. It's -- the casinos, what's going on with the city, the movement from California to Nevada. All of the football, baseball, sporting activity, Formula One, it just -- it's a great place to have a lot of retail real estate, and we're seeing real benefits in that. So, this will manifest itself in the fourth quarter as we're seeing that, but as we reached the breakpoints, but we're finally seeing the international tourists to come back to the States. Little weaker dollar helps, and obviously all the -- I think, finally, you don't have a vaccine card or whatever is required to come here, all of that kind of yesterday's news, as of today or yesterday. So, we're -- I think we're finally starting to see that come back like it was pre-pandemic. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And a quick question for Brian. You guys have a pretty healthy cash balance of over $1 billion, yet you still carry a balance in a revolver. I'm sure there is a pretty logical simple answer to this, but just curious. Brian McDade : Yeah, that's exactly right, the outstandings on our revolver are denominated in euros and they serve as a net investment hedge against our asset base in Europe. We do have a heavy -- a sizable cash balance as we did our offering earlier in this year and pre-funded the balance of our unsecured maturities for this year. So, we're carrying cash and we'll pay off the June maturities at par at maturity. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Brian McDade : Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please proceed with your question, Michael. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, your base minimum rent growth is accelerating. You have a nice SNO pipeline. You're talking about blowing past your 2% NOI growth guidance for the year. All sounds great. I guess the question is, how sustainable is this algorithm? How long can it continue? What are the factors that are ultimately going to weigh on this momentum that you have? David Simon : Well, look, I mean I think -- I see it continuing. We see good demand. We are tied to the general economic condition, but supply-demand is in our favor. I think our spot in our industry is well established. We have the confidence with our retail partners. We know what we want to do with our properties. We're not -- we don't [indiscernible] 1,000, we make mistakes all the time, but we know where we want to position them. And so, I hate using kind of this, but I -- it's really going to be the external environment that could slow this down, meaning what happens, do we do a recession or that? And I honestly think some of these markets are -- when people ask me that I actually think if we do go into recession, it will be \"kind of regional recession.\" I just don't see markets right now, they may flatten, they may not grow as much, but I don't see Florida's, Texas, Nevada's of the world, Georgia's, I just don't see them slowing. I don't see them going into a recession. So if there is one, we've always heard, well, it's going to be a regional one, this one might be one. But who -- I really don't know, but I think that's what slows us down. Obviously, we do have some headwinds with higher interest rates. We do have debt maturity at low rates, but rollover will cost us some growth. But we just have to kind of go through that and deal with it. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question, Linda. Linda Tsai : Hi. How do you think about the longer-term growth profile of the OPI business versus growth in overall portfolio NOI? Do you think the OPI business requires more consistent investment before it generates more stable returns? David Simon : Well. I think you have to look at it, the individual investments. And like for instance Authentic Brands Group is a growth machine. They're buying brands left and right. They're buying Billabong. They are buying Vince. They've got a huge pipeline. So, I've really seen that company growing, growing, growing. SPARC and Penny are -- SPARC is opening new stores, getting better at ecommerce, getting better operating. I'm sure -- they added Reebok to its portfolio last year, that still hasn't been fully integrated. So, I expect EBITDA growth to accelerate in the later half of '23 and '24. RGG, which includes Rue La La and Gilt, and importantly, Shop Premium Outlets. Remember we contributed that to that joint venture. Shop Premium Outlet is on fire. We're growing our GMV by leaps and bounds. I really think this was an idea we had years ago. We kind of got it off the ground, maybe not quite as good as [indiscernible] but we got it off the ground. We merged it in the RGG. And it's really rocking and rolling. We've got -- we're signing up good retailers all the time. That's got a great story to it. And we have some smaller investments in that. So, I think I see a real growth pattern in all of those. Penny is reinvesting. I think Penny has found its mojo. It's getting better brands in the store. We're making the stores look better. It's got growth in beauty that's investing. So the retailer side of OPI has a little more exposure in the economy because retail just does. But I think they all in their own way, have their own growth story. And -- but you know what, we're economic animals to extent that we get fair value. We've got lots of opportunities to invest in our company or other transactions that will add value. So, we look at these very clinical. And I just remember we've created a lot of value here with very little capital. And what's amazing, it's in our earnings now and which is a good sign because it means it's earning money. And given the small investment, it's been -- if you just want to look on return on our earnings and return on investment, it's been outstanding. So, very proud of it, very profitable. Not our core focus yet, while -- I used the executive team here to leverage our capabilities, intellectual firepower, et cetera, to make those companies better and I think we've done a pretty darn good job. We've had good partners across the board. So we've done it in a very prudent way and it's been very beneficial for us and I expect growth to continue. We'll have more ups and downs, it won't be a straight line, but I have -- I expect more growth from that category, same time 10 years from now or five years from now, we don't have to own any of these companies. Linda Tsai : Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up. Do you have a sense of how much mixed-use development could become as a percentage of portfolio NOI? And could you give us a sense of what that might represent today? David Simon : It's not very big today, what is it like 3%, 4%? Brian McDade : Yes, about 3%. David Simon : 3%. So, we're a big company. So to do a lot, to get to, like 8% to 10%, we take a lot, would be a few years down the road, but I don't see any reason why -- we certainly should try to strive to get up there if we can do it accretively in this kind of the 7% to 8% range, but that would be roughly $500-plus million of NOIs. So it's not -- it's going to take time. Linda Tsai : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question -- the final question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel Juste : Hey, there, thanks for letting me back in. I wanted to get to the second part of my question, and then I have one more. So the second part of my earlier question was, if you are expecting new lease volume to be about 25% of the overall leasing volume as it were in the first quarter over the near term? David Simon : Yeah. I think that's a reasonable number, yes, in that range. Haendel Juste : Okay. And then the second question I have was on foot traffic. We saw some recent placer foot traffic data for March, indicating that year-over-year foot traffic at enclosed retail malls is down 8% year-over-year in March. I'm curious if you're seeing similar trends at your properties? And if you think that's a reflection of the consumer and that's coming up in lease negotiations in the current environment? Thanks. David Simon : Well. Yeah, that's -- I'm glad you asked that because I have -- we keep track of that ourselves. And just to give you March over March -- '23 over March '22, we are 105.5% for malls, 105.6% for mills and 120.2% for outlets for 108% above last year this time. In January and February, we were actually much higher month-over-month. So, we -- for our portfolio, we're above -- traffic is above where it was this time last year, year-to-date, month-on-month. Haendel Juste : Okay, thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Brian McDade : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Simon for closing remarks. Thank you, sir. David Simon : Okay, thank you and I appreciate the questions, and we'll talk soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you very much for your participation.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I'm pleased to introduce, David Simon. David Simon : Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operation were $1.08 billion or $2.88 per share. I'll walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2022. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.08 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Higher interest income, and other income of $0.04. Higher interest expense cost us $0.08 in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, a $0.05 lower contribution from our other platform investments and publicly held securities compared to Q2 2022. FFO from our real estate business was $2.81 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.78 per share in the prior year period and year-to-date that comparison is $5.65 per share in 2023 compared to $5.58 in 2022. Our real estate business is performing ahead of our plan and overcoming the headwinds from higher interest expense and we are also pleased with our OPI results in the quarter and continue to expect the business to meet our original 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We believe the market value of our OPI platform is approximately $3.5 billion or roughly $10 per share. We generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $2.1 billion year-to-date. Domestic property NOI increased 3.3% quarter-over-quarter and 3.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.7% for the quarter and 3.8% for the first half of the year. Our mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 94.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. The mills occupancy was 97.3% and TRG was 93.7%. Average base minimum rent for the malls and outlets was $56.27 per foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. This is an all-time high for our BMR and the mills rent increased 4.3% to an all-time high of $36.02 per foot. Leasing momentum continued across our portfolio. We signed more than 1,300 leases for more than 5.0 million square feet for the quarter, and we are up to 11 million square feet year-to-date. We have 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $470 million and occupancy cost more than 30% of our total lease activity in the first half of the year was new deal volume. We continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community across many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in the second quarter was $747 per foot for our malls and outlets, the mills at $677 per foot. We also hosted our second annual National Outlet Shopping Day in June was very successful for shoppers and participating retailers. We generated more than 3 million shopper visits over that weekend. Feedback has been great. We are also excited to continue to build on this annual event, and we expect it to continue to get bigger and bigger each year. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of nine property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $820 million at an average rate of 6%. Our balance sheet is strong. We have $8.8 billion of liquidity. Today, we are proud to announce our dividend of $1.90 per share for the third quarter. That's a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. The dividend will be payable on September 29. We have now paid over $40 billion in dividends since we've been public. We are increasing our full-year guidance of 2023 from $11.80 per share to $11.95 per share to $11.85 and respectively $11.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint. Now, let me give you food for thought, if I may. We have built a world class portfolio over our long period of time since we've been public. Following our DeBartolo transaction in 1996, our portfolio consisted of 119 malls and 65 strip centers primarily in the Midwest. Since then, we have acquired 220 properties, developed more than 50 and disposed of approximately 250 properties. Of the original 184 properties in 1996, 37 remain in our portfolio today. So our high productive portfolio is a result of constant asset rotation. Finally, let me conclude by saying our business is performing well and is head of our internal plan. Tenant demand is excellent. Occupancy is increasing. Basement and rents are at record levels. Property NOI is growing and again, beating our internal expectations that we set at the beginning of the year. And we are now, operator, ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Sakwa : Thanks. Good afternoon, David. David Simon : How are you doing, Steve? Stephen Sakwa : Good. I just wanted to follow-up on your leasing comments in the pipeline. Everything sounds really good and maybe even getting better as the year unfolds. So where do you ultimately think that occupancy in kind of the mall portfolio can ultimately settle out? And are you seeing an accelerating trend in pricing power across the portfolio? David Simon : Steve, first of all, I think will be north of 95% by year-end. And I want to be \u2013 I don't like the word pricing power so much. I think, our asset rotation that I mentioned earlier has allowed us to create kind of a portfolio that's really unrivaled in our industry. And given our strong tenant relationships, we're in a good spot to find kind of the win-win that needs to happen when you lease as much space as we do. The physical environment in terms of bricks-and-mortar sales is as important as ever. That's been reinforced by essentially every retailer and anyone that's in the e-commerce business. All look to that. I think there was obviously a long period of time where many felt, many of the [pundits] felt that bricks-and-mortar just don't matter. That's the furthest thing from the truth. So we continue to think our rollover. By and large is going to be positive. And we have the ability now with new tenant demand to replace retailers that aren't producing sales and which will allow us to generate higher rent. So I do think we're pushing up rents. I think we're doing it hopefully thoughtfully by and large and we expect that trend to continue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. David, you gave those details on the asset rotation since 1996, so I guess that's making me wonder, and I'm guessing everybody else. Should that be a suggestion to us that you're looking to get more active in asset recycling kind of near-term, medium-term acquisitions dispositions? Or was that just more a comment on kind of the Simon historical strategy? David Simon : Well, I would say, we've been very active, right? So I think, because of our size, it does get lost in translation that we're always recycling, always looking to improve the quality of the portfolio. So I would think our trend would continue in that sense and will always recycle assets. We find to the extent that we can do that and generate more liquidity. We find our \u2013 and not just it's every asset that we have to the extent that we think there's a good trade to do, whether it's to sell or to buy, we're going to pursue that. And I think it's been an important component of our success over time. At the same time, we've done it. As we all know, we've done it in a way where others have done it in a way to generate the quickest short-term returns through a lot of leverage. We've done it as thoughtfully in terms of maintaining the balance sheet as anyone. So that's been another key component of our ability to grow yet recycle. So I don't think I'm signaling, but maybe you have these epiphanies, so maybe it's possible, right, that there'll be some \u2013 we'll be more active on reallocating capital to different assets than we have today. Caitlin Burrows : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey. Good afternoon down there, David. And also thank you for moving your call to avoid an overlap. Appreciated. So question, there was a recent press article and not that article, not which I'll let you opine if you want. But just talking about luxury sales, and my question is this, we all look at luxury as sort of like the ultimate, the driver of retail, if you will. But my question is really given how customer preferences have changed lifestyle, people changing how they live, sort of curious when you look at the tenant landscape. Are there any sectors that you would say are now, I guess going back to [Kaitlyn's] early 90s example. Are there any sectors now where you're like, hey, 20, 30 years ago, this sector was nowhere and now it's 20% of retail or it's the absolute must have. And I'm just sort of curious if luxury is still sort of that dominant place in retail, or if it's more nichey and it works in certain malls, but for the bulk of what really drives your cash flow to bottom line, maybe it's other sectors. I'm just trying to understand how the face of retail has changed using your analogy of over the past 30 years, what the company looked like then in the Midwest versus now? David Simon : Yes. Look, I would say, unquestionably the \u2013 some of the best retailers in the world like Kering or an LVMH Group, have the best brands, and they do the most volume. They build the best stores. They think longer term over any retailer that we've ever experienced. They're true to their business. So we admire what they do. We admire how they build their brand. We admire how they maintained their brand. They have loyal customers. So there's no better companies to do business with that belief, and we aspire to be more like them than, than anything. And I think how they maintain their stores and how they treat their customers and how they're true to themselves. So the luxury business is here to stay. It's growing. It's really important. It's worldwide. It's a great consumer that loves physical retail, that wants to go shop and do other things at our centers. So we want to do as much business as we can with them. They're still very focused. Obviously sales have flattened a little bit compared to Q2 of 2022. But if you look at where they are and Tom and Brian, I don't know off the top of my head, Alex, but they can \u2013 we're 20%, 30%, 40% above where we were in 2019. But I don't remember the exact number. But they can give it to you later. So one of the interesting things is LVMH Group, and really if you look at our 8-K, they're now our \u2013 in our top 10 tenants. We couldn't be more proud of that relationship and the brands that they have. So this is not a niche business. This is a growing business. It's for exactly the affluent shopper, the established shopper, but also the affluent shopper. And the fact that we do so much business with them is something that we're extremely proud of. And we will \u2013 I don't like the word lean in, but we will do as much as we can to continue to foster those relationships. And that is a huge differentiating point that we have at Simon Property Group. So it's all systems go there. Yes, sales will flatten, they'll go up, they'll go down, but their commitment to their customer and what they do in the stores, I think goes unabated. And they really \u2013 I admire the fact that they take \u2013 they're not a quarter-to-quarter company, they take a much longer view of their brand and where they want to plant their flag and how they want to treat their customers. So they are true partners and great generally across the board. We love doing business with them. And it's not a niche. And that business is growing, it's growing worldwide. And in fact, if anything, we'd like to follow kind of where they're headed because we think there's great business to do together. I hear you typing. Is that \u2013 another question? Alexander Goldfarb : Sorry. No, I think Tom said and Federal is right after you guys, so I thought my mic was already cut, so I didn't know you could\u2026 David Simon : We're kidding. We're only kidding. We'll talk to you later. Thanks, Alex. Alexander Goldfarb : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good afternoon. Could you discuss the [current thread] between leased and physical occupancy? And then kind of the cadence in what visibility your store openings for leases that have been executed, but are not yet open? Brian McDade : So this is Brian. We are still hovering right around 200 basis points of unopened. That ebbs and flows as you might imagine every month given the velocity of our business. We do think we're going to carry that through year end. And certainly, we do expect that we are going to continue to see openings throughout the balance of the year, as retailers open later this month and into September and October. David Simon : And I would say, just on follow-up on that, Vince, is that, a lot of the business that we have signed leases on and/or about to be signed is still \u2013 and I don't \u2013 I mean, we can give you the exact number. I don't have it again at the top of my tongue, but \u2013 at the tip of my tongue. But there is a lot of the business that we've signed or about to be signed is really 2024 and even 2025 business. And especially, when we're in the \u2013 we're talking the restaurant business, you're talking nine months build out, you're talking permits that are required to get \u2013 it's a little more complicated getting restaurant permits, liquor license, et cetera. We've got some great restaurants going into Forum, Crystal, Stanford, Boca, but you're literally talking about a year to get permitted, get opened. To some extent some of this was delayed also with just equipment because of the COVID and the \u2013 all of the supply chain issues associated with it. So \u2013 and again, when you're talking about our full price business, build outs are longer than the outlet or the mills business. So the pipe on that sense is pretty good, which is not in these numbers. But we also on that front have boxes that are scheduled to open in 2024, 2025. That is obviously serious long time, a year plus build out. A lot of business with Dick's, Primark, Life Time Fitness, et cetera that even Barnes is doing new deals. We're building a new store with Kohl's. Stuff that just takes time \u2013 and hours to shields, et cetera, even though they just recently opened in Wichita to a great opening, which is one of our 37, by the way, just for a fun fact. So the build out is frustrating in that, it does take time, but it's \u2013 so we still expect some really interesting things to happen in 2024, 2025 as these tenants open. And remember in a lot of cases, the more interesting the retailer, the longer the build out there is a correlation there. Vince Tibone : Yes. That makes sense. That's all really helpful color. I appreciate that. My next question, I was hoping you could discuss how demand today [differ by] retail format and geography. I'd be curious to hear anything between malls and outlets and also between gateway markets and suburban centers. David Simon : Simply, I thought, as I go back in time, I think the \u2013 and I'm trying to go through COVID. I think the demand in the outlet business has picked up more. It was slower to pick up than the mall business, and I think it's finally picked up to kind of where the mall business has been. So I think demand from a product type is kind of even now, and that's not to say malls have slowed down, the outlet took a little bit longer to pick back up. Mills was somewhat unabated in that. And as you know, it's a combination of any and all. Regionally, by and large, the super regional suburban sites have a high level of interest across the board. We don't have a lot of city center stuff. So it's \u2013 we're not the right guy to ask. But I am happy that our portfolio is positioned in the high catchment areas in the suburbs. And then finally, regionally, as you might imagine, where you're seeing population growth, Texas, Tennessee, Florida, those kind of places are seeing a little bit more of the outsized demand. But again, in real estate, you could still have the best location in kind of a micro environment that does unbelievably well because it still is the center of attention. So you got to be careful on these geographic trends one way or another. It really is, as we all know. Real estate is very location oriented. But I would say those are just kind of generic trends hasn't changed all that much. But the suburbs continue to be as we said a few years ago, well ahead of most. We still felt like that was the place to be, and we're happy to see that. Not that we make a lot of predictions, but we're happy to see that prediction. At least one of them came true. Vince Tibone : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Just one quick one. Just thinking about the growth function of the business. You talk about getting to 95% occupancy by the end of the year. Obviously, that annualizes in 2024. So when I think about the occupancy boost, the rent bumps, re-leasing spreads, it doesn't seem like a stretch to get to a 3% plus number next year in growth. So I'm trying to understand what are some of the moving pieces we should be thinking about as we're building out the growth function of the business in 2024? David Simon : Well, I think it's all of the likely suspects. It's lease-up, it's renewal spreads, it's new business, Obviously, it's overage or percent sales and sales activity. So there's nothing new there. I mean it's all the stuff that has allowed us to grow our comp NOI over a long period of time through a lot of volatility, COVID \u2013 real estate recessions, e-commerce, proliferation of this, that and the other. So it's all of those likely suspects. I mean I think we feel generally positive about our ability to grow comp NOI. But it's all the likely suspects and it's all the same metrics that we have to produce to generate that. And we still have the ability, even as we get up to 95%, thereabouts, we still have the ability to \u2013 which we can't lose sight of, we have the ability to replace retailers with better ones that will just common sense, we'll be able to pay higher rent because they'll be more productive. It's really that simple. So \u2013 but Ron, it's all the same stuff. And we're focused on hitting all of those cylinders certainly to finish this year, but also in 2024, 2025. And the added benefit that we have in 2024, 2025 is that we've got a lot in the pipeline that will finally open. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. I had \u2013 unfortunately, I have to limit it to one. So I won't focus on the less important OPI stuff. But maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the 200 basis points of sign-on open. Presumably, that's higher in your mall portfolio than your outlets? And maybe if you could also quantify in terms of dollar amount or NOI impact, I know that a lot of those leases in that. So there's a lot of luxury tenants, which typically pay significantly higher rents. So presumably, it has a greater impact on your NOI and ABR than your \u2013 than the percentage just in terms of occupancy? David Simon : Look, we don't want to get into that level of detail. We certainly will for 2024 as we outlined what our comp NOI growth is. But you're 100% right that the \u2013 it is much easier and quicker to open an outlet store. The build-out can be anywhere between 30 and 90 days. And the mall generally can be six months plus. And then when you get to complicated tenants or where the build-out is expensive. You're talking nine months plus restaurants in that area. But we do \u2013 and it goes back to, I think, Floris, you were one of the original analyst that was very focused on when we're going to get back to 2019 levels. And I'm happy to say that we will be back. We better be back, okay, but we will be back in there in 2024. And a lot of that really at the end of this year, we annualize it, so it really is a function of getting those retailers open. But the specific numbers, I mean, I'll \u2013 if the guys want to talk offline and go through it, I'm certainly happy to do that. But that's \u2013 I think it's better answered as we go through 2024 our comp NOI plan with you early next year. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Good afternoon. A follow-up question, David, on your comment on potentially allocating to money or investments into other assets. I mean, you've been doing that really since world financial crisis, investing in the best properties. You've been densifying assets with apartments, et cetera. Is there anything else that you're thinking of changing that you've noticed a change, let's say, between the difference in the assets you own or what you're seeing out in the retail landscape? Or really sticking with those programs as well? David Simon : I think, Jeff, we're going to more or less stick to our programs, but what we've done historically, I think it's been the right strategy. We'll nick and neck, I mean, we've had good experience by and large, not perfect, but good experience experimenting here and there. But our core business is high-quality retail real estate. We're not moving away from that by any stretch of the imagination. We have lots of levers in that category to pull in terms of how we want to allocate capital. Do we want to put more here versus there, do we want to sell this and reinvest that. So I think that \u2013 if I had the ability to express it, we think about that all of the time. We never really talk about it. But as we \u2013 the sole purpose of going through that asset rotation was to tell you that we do think about this stuff all the time. And beyond just think about it, we actually do stuff about it. So \u2013 and sometimes communicating that to investors and analysts is important to know that we're going to reallocate capital where we think the growth is, and we're not afraid to sell or buy or hold or whatever kind of we think is the right thing to do. So that's really it. I wouldn't make \u2013 this is not like \u2013 we're not trying to like here we go, something is big around the corner. It's just \u2013 we've done this, and we just wanted to point it out. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Yes. Hi. Can you give us a sense as to how rent spreads compare when you move from the mall and outlet portfolio to TRG to the mills? David Simon : Well, I don't want to really talk about TRG so much, but I would say the spreads are \u2013 when you look at mills, outlets and malls, it's all pretty decent. We still see \u2013 our occupancy cost now is around 12%, right? So we're feeling better about our ability to generate positive rent spreads. It's not always going to happen on every space in every mall or outlet, but we're seeing it pretty much across the board. And as again, I would say to you from what might shift is where I thought our outlet business was a little slower coming out of COVID. We're seeing a much better pickup over the last year or so there. And so we're optimistic that, that's going to continue as well. Michael Mueller : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. In your opening remarks, you talked about the deals in the pipeline and that 30% of lease activity in the first half was new deal volume. How does that compare to the past? And what does this indicate? Does this indicate that there is greater interest for new concepts to \u2013 that are interested in leasing or is there some other meaning behind this data point that you provided? Thank you. David Simon : I just think it \u2013 most importantly, it reinforces the importance of our product and it reinforces how retailers feel about our \u2013 the mall and the outlet business. So it's a great sign. I mean it's a great sign that we have new concepts. And I would say, generally, the 30% has really developed over the last, say, two months and whether it's direct-to-consumer, whether it's the luxury, whether it's a restaurant business, whether it's entertainment, we're seeing entertainment pickup like we did pre-COVID. So I think it's a testament to the product, the new retailers that want to open new stores in our existing product is a great sign and a great testament. And that level is certainly much higher than I've seen since I mean, it goes \u2013 I'm going to say, almost seven, eight years because the 2020 \u2013 I'm sorry, in 2019, we probably didn't have that level of percentage of new tenants. So it's clearly higher than it was in the 2019, 2018, 2017 level, and it kind of goes back to where we were in the 2014, 2015, 2016 level. So it's a good sign for sure. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good afternoon. Two-part question. One, it looks like there's a $0.10 or $0.11 gain in the P&L. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about what that is and if that was assumed in the guidance the prior guidance? And then secondly, if you have any comments on the prior quarter's comments on domestic property NOI of at least 3%. Thank you. David Simon : No, no, no, I know that. But the two \u2013 what did you say 2%? Juan Sanabria : 3%. David Simon : 3%, let me start there. So yes, we're feeling very comfortable that we'll be above the 3%. The after-tax gain is associated with the ABG raising of primary capital, which we get diluted down. So it's a \u2013 we have a dilution gain after tax, it was $0.07. Brian McDade : Yes, there's $0.03 of tax in the tax line, Michael, for that transaction. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And that wasn't in the prior guidance, I'm assuming, correct? David Simon : Well, we didn't \u2013 I don't \u2013 we give a pretty big range and really wasn't in our guidance so much to speak because that's really out of our control. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hey. Good afternoon. So quick two-parter on Taubman from me. NOI was down 3% from last quarter, while occupancy was up 40 basis points. Just curious what the drivers were of that decline. And then in line with your comments on asset recycling, can you remind us the process by which you would recapture the remaining 20% of that investment and whether you're planning to do so? Or maybe that's one of the assets that you might be looking to recycle? David Simon : Well, I'm not going to comment on that. So there are puts and calls associated with Taubman over basically a five-year period. They have the right to kind of slowly put 20% of their interest to us, and then we eventually have a call associated with it. So that's that. And Brian, why don't you go through the \u2013 it really was more of a function of kind of the percent rent or overage rent that they had in Q2 of last year. But you can \u2013 do you have any other comment on it. Brian McDade : Yes, Greg, that's exactly what it was. You can see on a year-to-date basis, we're still ahead, but they did have a higher percent of rent contribution in Q2 of last year than they did this year. David Simon : The other thing on Taubman, if you on TRG, so our FFO contribution this quarter versus last quarter is lower, and it's primarily three things. Number one is, we've got D&O insurance reimbursement in Q2 of 2022. That's number one. Number two is we also had a land sale. And then obviously, number three is the higher interest expense. So there are a little more exposure to floating rate debt there. And I think the spread difference between our FFO contribution from TRG to Q2 of 2022 over 2023 was \u2013 how many cents? $0.07, something like this? Brian McDade : $0.07. David Simon : $0.07, okay? So I still remember numbers. So if you go through \u2013 so our FFO contribution from Taubman TRG where we own 80% was $0.07 lower this quarter than Q2 of last quarter of 2022, okay? So that might be helpful to you. Those are the order of magnitude, if there's any details on that call Tom or Brian. But that's generally it. So we had a lower contribution. Is that the right number, Adam? Adam Reuille : Yes. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. That's the right number. So there's really not much to ask. Greg McGinniss : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good evening out there. David, can you talk about\u2026 David Simon : To be technical, we're really not out there. We're actually in New York City today. So I know Indiana is considered out there, which I will not comment on, but we're actually right here. I don't know where you are, but we're right here in New York City. Haendel St. Juste: I'm not too far from you. So can you talk about the outlook for retail sales in the back half of the year given the macro and the expiration of the student loan payments and what you think that will do or impact that will have on the business. And maybe some commentary also on year-to-date debt how that's trending and early thoughts on potential improvement on that line item in 2024? Thanks. David Simon : Yes. I would say we're actually optimistic on the back half of this year because comps or sales, I should say, in the second half of 2022 really started to decelerate because of the \u2013 obviously, the increase in interest rates, gas prices, inflation. So I think across the board, our comps get easier for our retailers in the second half \u2013 so we're actually optimistic. And I think generally, the economy, as we all know, is seems to relatively stable. Obviously, it's a very uncertain world. So anything can happen. But we're actually optimistic on sales for the second half, and we expect it to comp up on \u2013 with respect to bad debt, we're not seeing \u2013 I mean it continues to be lean and mean \u2013 and it's a little more than maybe last year, but it's like \u2013 it's still comparatively historical lows. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of 3% NOI growth, is that the level you think you could sustain next year? David Simon : I would hope so, yes. Linda Tsai : Any color around that? David Simon : Not one of my qualities, but that was the most succinct answer that all day. Do you have another question, Linda? Linda Tsai : Sure. I guess on Page 19, you also broke out mixed-use in franchise operations income and also the same line item for expense. Maybe just a little more color? David Simon : Yes. I think Brian and Tom felt because we're doing \u2013 and these are only consolidated assets, so we have a \u2013 we have a big franchise operation with Starbucks in terms of our \u2013 where we franchise some Starbucks location plus, obviously, we're building hotels. And the \u2013 and it was all lumped into the other income, other expense, and we thought instead of having all the questions on why is this number growing and this number growing? We kind of \u2013 we just felt like it would be better to separate it. For your \u2013 believe it or not, for your benefit. Linda Tsai : And then how do we model that going forward? David Simon : Look, I think the hotel business is pretty straightforward in that we're building it. We have certain returns. And I think we pretty much outlined our returns in our 8-K. So I think that's pretty. Obviously, it takes time for apartments or hotels or any mixed use to stabilize. But I think that will be pretty easily. At the end of the day, the Starbucks business is not over \u2013 it's not even material. So there is some profit embedded in there, but it's \u2013 we view it more as an amenity that we can make some margin on. And it's grown a little bit bigger than what it was historically because we took over some of the operations during COVID. And so that's not an overly material number and we can kind of give you order of magnitude of revenue and expense. The only problem this year really some of these just came on board. So I'd say to you in 2024 will be the kind of the first full-year, and that will probably be \u2013 we can certainly outline what it is. But the net profit is not overly important. Does that's help? Linda Tsai : Yes. Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Good afternoon. David, just a quick clarification on one of the earlier questions about the $0.07 net gain. You guys raised guidance here by $0.05 at the midpoint. Could you just run through if there are any other puts and takes that moved around with guidance this quarter or maybe this wasn't the sole driver, but maybe something operational, and this could have offset something else? Just trying to get a sense that was this the reason guidance went up and had this not happened, you guys would have ended up kind of lowering the range here on the margin? David Simon : No. I mean I think we're always pretty conservative. So we'll see how the \u2013 we're always trying to beat and improve our numbers. I think we have as good a history of anybody to do that. And again, we always \u2013 I know that might frustrate folks, but there's always puts and takes in a company our size. I mean we have $80 billion of assets. We're not a small strip center company that's got \u2013 there's going to be some volatility. We've got a $3.5 billion asset portfolio. But so far, this year has thrown off zero earnings, FFO essentially, it's mostly back-half \u2013 back-end weighted. Again, we have $3.5 billion of value market doesn't value. It's not in our earnings. I think the number to look at is our \u2013 the number we gave you, which is our kind of FFO real estate earnings. That was at 281, if I remember that was hurt by $0.08 of rising interest rates. That's 289. I think we give you comp NOI, you're going to have some volatility because of OPI. I think OPI is really simple. $3.5 billion, it's going to make $0.50, $0.60. And it's on our books for a lot less \u2013 and again, in terms of investments and monetization and everything else associated with that, we're always going to do the right thing. So that's really it. I think obviously, overage rent has stabilized. So it's a little more conservative. We want to make sure we're conservative as we look at the year. If sales do grow on the back-end weighted that we think will be our overage number, which we mean we'll beat our guidance. But we don't have a crystal ball, but we've been \u2013 we've raised our guidance from the beginning of the year. That's the important thing. We've had headwinds with that rising rates went up higher than we thought \u2013 is probably the biggest headwind. And then second, the OPI's side has been more back-end weighted than we originally anticipated. And that's simple as that. The other thing to remember is \u2013 so ABG just raised money at basically a $20 billion enterprise value because of their growth, we got \u2013 we own 12% of the company. We got zero funds from operation contribution from them because of all of their onetime charges. We had the same situation in Penney, and that's why we are giving you this real estate FFO number, put a multiple on it. It's too low. Whatever multiple you think it is, I would add a couple of 100 basis points. It's too low then add $10 a share, and that's our NAV and then enjoy the rest of the summer. That's how I would think about it. Are you still there? Craig Mailman : I am. Thanks, David. David Simon : Okay. You buy that argument? Craig Mailman : We need to talk about. David Simon : All right. Thank you for listening. Okay. So I think we're out of questions, and I owe it to Don Wood. Now I want to tell you a story, okay? So we \u2013 Don initially stole our 5 :00 o\u2019clock time period \u2013 so we were not very happy and we said we'll do it together. And then I said, you know what, we're we loved Don, we want to be friendly. So not only did we move our time, but we gave Don the option of whether he wanted to do 4 :30 or 5 :30 and he chose 5 :30. So if you don't like our time or you don't like his time, blame Don, but I'll hand it over to Don. I feel like Ed McMahon and Don is Johnny Carson. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you to please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good evening. And I'm pleased to report our third-quarter results. Third quarter funds from operation were $1.2 billion or $3.20 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2022, domestic and international operations had a very good performance this quarter, and contributed $0.17 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Non-cash after-tax gain -- gains of $0.32 in the third quarter were related to the partial sale of our ownership interest in SPARC and ABG as a result of ABG selling primary shares in the quarter. Higher interest expense was a setback of $0.07 year-over-year. We had a $0.15 lower contribution from our other property investment platform compared to Q3 2022, and a $0.02 loss on mark-to-market of publicly traded securities. FFO from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the third quarter compared to $2.83 in the prior period last year. So far, our real estate has produced $8.55 per share for the first nine months compared to $8.40 from last year. We are pleased with the transaction SPARC completed with SHEIN during the third quarter that demonstrated the value that we have created in that business. The transaction was significantly above our basis. And as a result, we recognized a gain in the corner. And the transaction ultimately reduced our ownership interest in SPARC from 50% to 33% as we have managed SHEIN as a partner. Given our lower ownership interest in the back-end weighting profitability in the fourth quarter, we now expect $0.05 lower FFO contribution from SPARC in the fourth quarter of this year. During the third quarter, the Taubman family exercised their put right on a portion of their interest in TRG. We exchange 1.725 million partnership interest units for an additional 4% ownership interest. We now own 84% of TRG. Domestic property NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year for the quarter and 3.8% for the first nine months. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.3% for the quarter and 4% for the first nine months of the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.2%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to last year. Our third quarter occupancy is higher than fourth quarter of last year, which has not occurred historically. The mill's occupancy was 97.4%, and occupancy is above all year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 2.9% year-over-year and the mills was 3.6% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continues across our portfolio. We signed more than 970 leases for approximately $4.3 million square feet in the quarter. Through the first nine months of 2023, we signed more than 3,500 leases for 15 million square feet, which is expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. We have an additional 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for another $400 million in revenue. We are seeing strong broad-based demand from retail community, including continued strength for many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in the third quarter was $744 for the mills and outlets combined and $676 for mills. We continue to be active in redevelopment and new development. During the quarter, we started construction on a significant redevelopment at Brea Mall, and a new upscale outlet center in Jakarta, our first Premium Outlet in Indonesia. We completed the refinancing of 11 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year for a total of $960 million at an average rate of 6%. We have -- our balance sheet is strong with approximately $8.8 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced a dividend of $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter, which is a year-over-year increase of 5.6%. The dividend is payable on December 29th. And we also purchased approximately 1.27 million shares of our common stock for $140 million. We are increasing our full-year 2023 guidance from $11.85 to $11.95, to $12.15 to $12.25 per share. This is an increase of $0.30 at the midpoint. So to conclude, I'm pleased with our third-quarter results. Our business is performing well and is ahead of our plan. Tenant demand is strong. Occupancy is increasing. Base minimum rent levels are at record levels. And we are very experienced at managing our business through volatile periods of time. And as you all know, this is when we do some of our best work. So, we're now ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ron Kamdem : Great. Thanks so much. Just one on some of the guideposts you've given in the past. As we're flipping the calendar to 2024, you talked about sort of 3% organic growth as achievable. Just wondering how you're thinking about that and how we should think about potential interest costs, headwinds as debt sort of rolls? Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Look, I think we feel good about that kind of comparable NOI growth. Our debt is reasonably laddered. So yes, we'll have some interest expense headwinds, but we still think we'll end up growing our business next year with that said. Ron Kamdem : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Go ahead, Ron. Ron Kamdem : I was just going to say if I could ask a follow up just on the $0.30 cent guidance raise. I think you talked about $0.32 cent gain and then $0.05 cents lower from the retailers. Just wondering is there any other sort of puts and takes that we should be mindful of? Thanks. David Simon : Sure. No, we're going to have $0.05 lower because of the SPARC-SHEIN deal. We lost a couple of cents from our mark to market on a couple of our public securities that we own last quarter. And essentially the real estate business has been very significant to our growth and we'll kind of see where the fourth quarter ends up but I think it's -- 97% of our business is going to outperform what we thought from originally what we had budgeted. Ron Kamdem : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good evening everyone. David, I know you gave some numbers on recent leasing activity which sounds really strong. I was wondering if you could give some additional context maybe to how that leasing activity compares to recent and pre-pandemic years, maybe what that means for pricing and how that could impact permanent occupancy? David Simon : Well, thank you, Caitlin. So I would say, let me try and address your questions in no particular word. I think we'll be, year-end occupancy will be obviously higher than it is today. I don't know that it will be our highest ever, but it it'll be within distance pretty close. Even with all the volatility in the world and the market, we still expect -- we still see demand very strong. I mean, we're -- frankly, we're cautious, we're waiting for shoes to drop, but we haven't seen it on our new deals, whether it's F&B, entertainment, high-end luxury tenants, athleisure, just to name some categories. We're seeing -- we're still seeing a lot of demand on that front. And I would say from a pricing element, we feel -- I would say we feel comparable to the way we felt in \u201815, \u201816, \u201817 era, in terms of era. I guess that was almost seven, eight years ago, but lots happened over those seven or eight years. But we still feel like that's kind of -- we're in that good shape where we're driving rents up and it's okay for the retailers. They're making deals and supplying demands in our favor. Obviously we cycled through a lot of poor performing retailers due to COVID. And the ones that we are doing new deals with are excited to do business with us. So pricing is for sure going in the right direction. Occupancy is going up. And tenant demand is pretty strong across the whole spectrum. And even in certain categories, just to take luxury, yes, there are some that are being more cautious, but there's plenty that are growing new stores. So it's really retail specific. Obviously bricks and mortar through the pandemic to today has proven its value to retailers. I'm sure you hear that on the conference calls from retailers. So in that sense, we're making a lot of good stuff happen. Brian, did you have something on the occupancy? Brian McDade : I was just going to say we continue to see about 30% of our deals being new deals in the quarter. So that's consistent with the prior quarter as well. So there is definitely lots of activity on a new deal basis. Caitlin Burrows : Great, sounds encouraging. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Samir Khanal : Good evening, everyone. David, maybe provide color on how your malls are performing versus outlets, maybe from a regional standpoint, coastal, non-coastal, Sun Belt, just trying to see if there's any differences from a leasing standpoint? Thanks. David Simon : Sure. It's interesting. I would say we're seeing pretty good tenant sales growth on the tourism properties, whether they're outlet or malls. Now, the most of our pure tourist properties are really the outlet centers, and we're seeing good growth in that category. Traffic, generally, is slightly above last year, still slightly below \u201819, but obviously conversions way up because our sales are on a per square foot basis are much higher than \u201819. I would say generally whether mall or outlet, the Sun Belt area has produced pretty good results in terms of sales year-to-date. We saw actually a decent pickup in California which was encouraging, but really good growth in a Woodbury Common that is finally getting the tourism back to where it is. And, [Prairie] (ph) has been strong in the outlet business. There's no question people are looking for a little more value or maybe they're looking for a lot more value given the higher inflation that the consumers had to deal with. Not a huge bifurcation between malls and outlets. It's very property specific. The different -- as you know, we reported flat sales basically quarter-over-quarter and there's no real difference between outlets and malls in that number. Luxury probably, well didn't probably, it did flatten out in the third quarter of this year for sure, but it wasn't across the board. It was more a couple specific retailers had a tough Q3, others were up. So it was really retailer-specific. Jewelry, malls may have a little more exposure to jewelry. So that was a category that took a little more on the chin. Yet some of our higher end retailers in the jewelry category performed well. So it was basically not a real trend. I'd say the most important thing to come away with is that the Sun Belt continues to perform well and we're seeing the tourist centers kind of make a nice comeback. They've been lagging a little bit more than the others over time, and a little bit of flatlining in the luxury category. Tom, Brian, anything you want to add? Brian McDade : No, I think you covered it, David. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good evening. Good evening out there, David. So I'll do one question and I'll hold the follow-up. As you guys gain leverage with the tenants, are you seeing tangible ability to get more favorable terms? One of the issues with retail over time has been the tenants, especially the larger tenants or the more anchorage or more fashion, like the hot tenants of the day are driving lease terms traditionally. Curious if you're seeing a change in that which would translate to an ability to accelerate rent growth, NOI growth, et cetera. David Simon : Well, we don't have -- I mean, thank you for the question, Alex. We're not that far away. You always say out here, we're really not that far away. But put that aside, it's not a question of leverage over the retailers. I think what we have going for us is a great diverse portfolio. It's the best in the industry from mills to our outlets to our full price malls. And that's unique, its size, its scale, its quality that we\u2019ve built up over many, many years. And as you remember, I don't think it was last quarter, maybe it was, Tom, but when we went through the transformation of the portfolio, was it last quarter? So we've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the portfolio. And I would say that obviously there's not a lot of new retail being built. There's not a lot of retailers closing stores and -- or going bankrupt. And I think most retailers today know kind of the good malls and the good properties versus the not so good. And when you add that up, supply and demand is in our favor and we're generating market rents. It's neither here nor there. But importantly, and I think I'd like to address this with you is that, and again, I'm sure retailers have different point of view, but I think the most interesting fact, or the most interesting thing that we have going for us in addition to the quality, diversity, et cetera, that I mentioned, they know we're going to be around. So -- and they know that we'll stick to a deal, we'll make it happen. When we say we're going to redevelop something, we do it. And I think that when there are open to buys, we tend to get our fair share of those or more than because of some of the factors that I mentioned, quality, scale, but also the fact that they know we're going to get the job done. And obviously there's been a lot of changes in mall ownership over the years. Balance sheet and quality of operations is a two-way street. It's both. As we look at retailers, we assess that. They certainly assess us. And I think that gives us an advantage that we've worked very hard, as you know, to achieve and, I mean, how do I say this? I mean, we've really outpaced our peer group dramatically in any measure you want, growth, earnings, dividend, quality of operations, scale, balance sheet, the -- I know we all focus quarter to quarter and this and that, but if you take a step back and you go, what do you got going for you? And again, we don't -- this sounds a little braggadocious. I don't want it to, but I mean, we've really outpaced, if you look over the last 10 -- 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years, you know, we've dramatically outpaced our peer group. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. No follow-up. I stumped you. I love it. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. David, just want to tie in some of the leasing comments, the momentum you're seeing, the deals in the pipeline, the high occupancy levels to the redevelopment pipeline. And just, I guess, how are you thinking about that pipeline and the ability to increase that? Like, how are you going to satisfy some of the needs out there and continue to capture that market share maybe even more? David Simon : Thank you, Jeff. So look, I think we have the ability to develop and redevelop because we're not -- essentially what I said earlier, we're not -- listen, we've got to be stewards of capital, we've got to be very focused but we're not capital constrained the way some others might be. And our ability to invest in our portfolio is unmatched. So we intend to do that. Now at the same time, Jeff, rates are up. Returns for us have to be up. And so you haven't seen a really big change in our 8-K redevelopment, but that takes time because a lot of the stuff was put in place. But when we build something new or we redevelop, we're going to have to do a better job of leasing and returns and to warrant that capital because just about everything we do, I mean we still want to maintain our leadership position, but just about every amount of capital we spend, I have to measure it in my own mind against buying our stock back. And, I mean our stock, as you saw we bought stock back, so our stock is pretty compelling. So we want to redevelop, we want to new develop, but we've got a high hurdle that we've got to jump over. So like we've done historically, I expect us to find the right balance between continuing and to maintain our leadership position, investing in our properties for the benefit of shareholders, communities, retailers alike, but at the same time, we've got to be economic animals. And that's what -- everybody here understands that process, and that's what we try and achieve. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed. Michael Goldsmith : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, you specifically mentioned the performance of the real estate business on this call several times, which has been strong. At the same time this quarter you sold off some of SPARC. So how can you continue to refine some of the ancillary parts of the business so that the strength that we're seeing and that you're talking about on the core business can continue to shine through? David Simon : Well, listen, it's a very good question and it's less and less of our business. As you know, it's under 5% of our earnings. You also have to understand that, when we add to the -- when we add it to our FFO, it's net income, which in many of these cases, you don't add -- well, all of these cases, you don't add back depreciation. So EBITDA and our FFO contribution are much different. Importantly, these have all been profitable endeavors. But we understand that even this small amount of earnings that we get in comparison to our total earnings power is volatile. People don't like the volatility. We'll, like we did with SPARC earlier, we're going to continue to harvest our investments over time. And as we do that, we're going to -- if you ask me today, we'll monetize things over time and we're going to buy our stock back because it's wildly accreted because let's look at it. You know what I trade at as a multiple of FFO and you know I have investment value in these investments, but they give us very little earnings because of GAAP. And if you do the math, you can see the accretion we would get on a buyback. So they're basically, I get no earnings from them, but I've got value and it's our job to get the value into cash, take the cash, buy our stock back or invest in properties and have it a bygone era of the time. But with an asterisk that said, attaboy, you made a lot of money. So that's the strategy. I hope that answers your question. Operator : Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed. Floris van Dijkum : Hey David. Thanks for taking my question. So I was curious on TRG. So I noticed the occupancy dipped a little bit. You essentially -- you want to, increasing your ownership by 4% by issuing some OPUs. What price was the stock issued at and what yield are you buying? What's the implied cap rate on the TRG business and how should we think about that also as it relates to other potential opportunities in the market and how much flexibility was there and then maybe I guess in terms of the timing of the next sort of puts or hurdles that you have for increasing your interest in that business going forward? David Simon : Yeah, let me -- I'll just talk about the exchange a little bit, and then Brian can give you an idea. The occupancy is no big deal, but I'll let Brian go through that. So Taubman has the right to put their interest, their 4% interest for the next five years and it's basically at essentially appraised value. It's either a negotiation or we get appraisal firms. We decided to negotiate in good faith. We made a deal and then we issued the stock. And, I mean the reality is we're trading, Simon Property Group unequivocally is trading below appraised value. So one of the reasons we bought our stock back was, I'm not a big fan of issuing stock at this moment in time, so we'll use our capital to basically get rid of the dilution that we did issue. Now, Taubman had that right. They exercised it appropriately. We had a good faith negotiation, made a deal, and it was more or less at their appraised value. And to put it in perspective, for today's value, it's probably pretty close to where we negotiated our deal with Taubman pre-COVID and then obviously we got the COVID adjustment, but it was in that range, kind of where the deal was announced publicly. And so we're going to quarterize that dilution by buying our stock back. We started that once we made the deal. And I think the family's pretty smart. They said, Simon Property Group stock\u2019s undervalued, and I like the dividend, and why not? So I think, I don't know what will happen next year. It could be the same thing, but at this point they have 16% left in TRG. We're happy to own 100% of TRG. I think they're happy, to do what they're doing and we'll deal with it as time goes on. But nothing can happen the rest of this year and it's sometime next year that this all recycles. So with that said, I hope that answers that, but I'll --Brian, if you want to add anything to that, please. Brian McDade : Nothing on that, but, Floris, on your question about their occupancy, it is back 110 basis points. There were really two major spaces that they had to take out of commission that they come back online in the fourth quarter. So you will see that come back on and then some in the fourth quarter, it's just simply timing. Floris van Dijkum : Got it. And if I may -- if you don't mind, the -- if I recall correctly after you look at my notes but the cap rate at the time that you did the deal was, it had a six handle on it. Is that the right way to think about the appraised value for TRG? David Simon : Well, again, this was a negotiated deal. Their view of appraised value started much higher than that with all due respect for us, which you might imagine. But we settled on a deal that today, if you go back in time to -- Taubman pre-COVID would have attributed Taubman's per share number in the $51 range. So somewhere in that range, we ended up, if you remember, doing COVID at $43 a share. I will tell you that their NOI today is higher than it was in \u201819. Portfolios change here and there, so it's really hard to do an apple on apple, but at the end of the day, that gives you the sense of things. But you're not that far off. I think that's a reasonable estimate. But that kind of puts all the metrics out there. And again, not a huge deal in the scheme of things, under a couple hundred million today. So -- but it gives you a perspective of kind of that. I think they would argue the appraised value is much higher than what they exchange at, but we ultimately did not go through the appraisal process. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks, David. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed. Vince Tibone : Hi, good afternoon. So minimum base rents were about 3% year-over-year, which is about the same level as contractual bumps. So I'm just trying to get a sense of leasing spread economics here. Like, does that mean leasing spreads are also in the low single-digit range or are there other factors influencing this metric, one way or another? David Simon : Well, I mean, I'll see if Brian will add to it. Just remember, this is the total portfolio, so to move this thing up takes a lot, right? And spreads are just a moment -- leases that come in and go out. So you can't really look at it that way. So for us to move the entire portfolio gives you a sense of leasing spreads. Now, if you look at whatever pages on the 8-K, the new -- we added some new information there on the 29 -- 21. That -- you'll see some of that -- some of these that are going in there now are driving the rent. Those numbers now include our new leases that are driving that base minimum rent up. Brian McDade : Yes. I mean we typically only touch about 10% of our leases a year, Vince. So you got to factor that in as well. So renewals are about 10%, but the balance is our new leases, which as David said, are really driving the higher -- or contributing to the higher average base minimum rents. Vince Tibone : But was my statement fair though, that contracts will bump for base rents still around 3% or are they lower than that, the overall portfolio? Brian McDade : No, they're right in that range, Vince. Vince Tibone : And then just -- is there any color you can share about renewal spreads? And I know it's hard to move the overall portfolio with 10%, but this kind of conversation means they're not too far away from the average contractual bumps. Because if they were plus 30%, to take an extreme example, we could see that in the metrics. So I'm just trying to ultimately get some more color here on renewal economics. David Simon : Yeah. I mean, I guess, again Vince, in order to have the average base minimum rent go up for 20,000 leases, okay, of 3%, versus 10% to 15% that calculate spread, you're going to be -- mathematically going to have rent spreads that are higher than the 3%. And we'll walk you through that later, but that, just from a math point of view, there's just no way that that can drive that number up, but we'll walk you through that. So when you say that, we would say to you that's not reality because in order to drive up average base minimum rent for 20,000 leases or thereabouts, you're going to have to outperform much more than the 3% on just what's rolling over. Vince Tibone : We can take it offline. I appreciate the time. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good evening David and Brian. I'll keep this to 1.5 questions for you. So last quarter you spoke about potentially being more active with asset recycling or reallocating real estate capital. Have the challenges facing the financing market changed those expectations at all? Or how are you thinking about that today? And how are higher interest rates impacting your customers and tenants? David Simon : Well, I'll take the last first. So I would say higher interest rates/inflation clearly is affecting a good portion of the consumer out there. So their affordability for -- and we're seeing this most on the consumer on what I'd call the kind of the more -- the brands that are focused on the more moderate income consumer. So there's no question that that's having some impact. But the good news is you've got employment and you've got wage growth that is counter balancing that, but they're definitely being more cautious. So that's not necessarily affecting a higher income consumer to the extent that you might otherwise think, but it's clearly affecting the lower or more moderate income consumer that they're being more cautious. And from our standpoint, from a retail point of view, demand, like I said earlier, we haven't seen it affecting retailers too much in terms of their growth plans. But we obviously monitor that every day. So from our standpoint, our cost of capital is up. So any investment we make, as I mentioned earlier, is in the -- is measured against return we would get from buying our stock back to return that we would get from redevelopment or development. And given that, that's why we haven't been active on the acquisition front. And I don't expect that to really change. In addition, we're always looking at monetizing our assets, whether it's real estate or otherwise, and to the extent that we can make the math work and we create liquidity through asset sales, the math is very compelling for us to do that to buy our stock back. And so you'll see more of that trend continue. Greg McGinniss : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Mike Mueller : Yeah. Hi, just a quick one here. I know this is a bit of a hypothetical, but do you think you would have bought stock back if you didn't issue the shares to Taubman? David Simon : I think we would buy, I'm sorry, I think we're looking -- it's a good question, a fair question, and let me say this, the way I'm thinking about it. So to the extent that we have additional liquidity events or in the case of Taubman, dealing with the dilution of issuing stock at this price, there's no question we're going to buy our stock back. To the extent that we don't, I don't have an answer for you yet on whether we would have done it absent the TRG issuance or enhanced liquidity from asset sales. But like I said, our development pipeline, redevelopment pipeline is very much, very much measured up against the stock buyback. And every asset I've got, I don't have to own anything at this point. I'm happy to sell assets at the right price to buy our stock back. And I think you'll see more of that from us over time. And that could be real estate and/or other stuff. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. And real quick, and just in case I missed this, was there any change to the OPI guidance that's embedded in your current FFO outlook? David Simon : Yes, we've lowered it. We've lowered it. Other than the -- you understand the $0.05 because we own less of SPARC. We have lowered it for the fourth quarter by roughly guys -- for the fourth quarter it would be about $0.20. Brian McDade : Yeah, David Simon : Roughly $0.20 in the fourth quarter. Lower contribution -- if you look in total for the year, and our share of that is roughly -- if you take out the $0.05, we've lowered it about $0.15 cents. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay, thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed. Nick Joseph : Thanks. It\u2019s actually Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, you've talked a lot on the share buybacks and it sounds like in your answer to the last question, we're open to asset sales and other monetization opportunities. What are you seeing in the transaction market today in terms of those asset sales? Where are cap rates? What's the buyer pool like? Are you seeing an opportunity to try to crystallize some of that disconnect between the stock price and where you'd hope to sell an asset? David Simon : Well look, I think domestic retail is not a lot of transactions, but we have assets throughout the world. That's one. Two is obviously we've got investments in our OPI category. But frankly, domestic assets other than maybe some of our residential stuff, hotel stuff, there's just not a lot happening. And we might see some stuff, but I think that won't be really driving kind of the activity that we would anticipate. Nick Joseph : Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed. Linda Tsai : Hi, thanks for taking my question. About 6% of ABR is on month-to-month leasing and then 12% expiring for \u201824. How much of the month-to-month is getting converted to permanent or should that number grow? And then in terms of the 12% expiring in \u201824, what's been addressed from a renewal standpoint from where you stand today? David Simon : Yeah, I know that there's a number of leases in \u201823 that are basically agreed to. We're just finalizing the documentation. So that's the first. And I would think that generally we're more than halfway through \u201824 right now on a kind of a negotiated, not papered basis. So, Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything to it, but that would be -- that's kind of where we are generically. Brian McDade : And Linda, you can see the material change, Q2 over to Q3, we've cleared about 2.2 million square feet out of that category. It's just a matter of processing. We talked about it on our last call. There's just a lag effect on the processing of those leases. So we do expect that to continue. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good evening out there. Dave, I just had a quick follow-up on the consumer retail sales line of question from earlier. I think you noted your portfolio sales were flattish during the quarter. We've heard from other sectors, storage, apartments, which seemed like the consumer hit a bit of a wall during the third quarter in September. I'm curious if you saw anything within the quarter, maybe in September of that sort? And then perhaps what your expectations in the near-term outlook for retail sales for your portfolio and the consumer as we head into the holiday season the next year? Thanks. David Simon : Sure. Well, generally, as we said earlier in the year, we expect to be more or less flat. So that's kind of what our expectations continue to be in terms of retail -- reported retailer sales. Again, we feel pretty good about the higher income consumer. We've also got a balancing act in terms of -- some of our value-oriented centers will maybe play a more important role for our consumer today that they might not have otherwise played last couple of years. But, it's unknown. I mean, we're being extra cautious because of the -- inflation is still a little bit there, still taking a bite out of the consumer and obviously you've got rates that are beginning to filter through the economic system. So cautious, flat, we're not anticipating a downturn, but not a robust sales growth for the fourth quarter, relatively flat. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate that. If I could squeeze in a follow-up, I think you mentioned earlier as well that you started, I think it was [$960 million] (ph) of new redevelopment at 6% yields, and you talked about a higher hurdle rate, maybe some color on perhaps what that hurdle rate today is and where the next batch of redevelopment yields or projects would need to be and where we could see them migrate to? Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Yeah, I think the -- it's a little bit dependent upon the real estate. So, and what we're trying to accomplish and what the benefits of that real estate are and where the market is for that. So, for instance, when we build a new residential apartment house, we look at kind of where the value and the cap rates for that are. They may be obviously lower than our own, but to the extent that we feel like we might sell it and make the arbitrage, we'll do that. Again, if we've got an asset that's a 6% cap rate, we're building to an 8%, that's creating value. On the other hand, if we have an 8% asset that we're building to a 6%, it ain't going to happen. So there's no -- we have themes. We have points of view. But just like anything else, every transaction we do, every redevelopment we do really is grounded by what we're trying to accomplish with that real estate. So -- but overall, again, like I said earlier, we've got to push it higher because, our cost of capital regardless is up across the board. So we don't have the luxury to build dilutive deals. And as you know, we've never really bought dilutive. We've never really built dilutive. And we certainly don't anticipate in doing that today. We've always had a spread to our financing and to the quality of what we built. We expect that to continue but that -- obviously those thresholds have been raised. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our final question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. Juan Sanabria : Saving the best for last. I love it. Thanks for the time. I'm just curious if you could comment on kind of the watch list you've commented about the consumer, but maybe what the bad debt has been here to date with the historical levels is in your perspective as you think about \u201824. David Simon : The watch list on retailers? Juan Sanabria : Yes sir. David Simon : Yeah, it's relatively low. There are a couple that were there today that probably weren't there last year. Obviously I'm not going to name those. So it certainly hasn't grown all that much, but there are one or two retailers that we're paying close attention to. And I probably wouldn't have said that last year. So I think that -- I mean it's not a very good answer, but it's probably the best way to explain it without naming names. But there are a couple on that list today that didn't exist yesterday. But they're not 10 names, they're a couple. Brian, you want to add anything? Brian McDade : No, I think that's right, David. It is certainly expanded, but by only two or three names. And it's at a relatively low point relative to history. David Simon : Yeah, and I want to just confirm with everyone that that is, as you look at our, what page is our top tenant list on? Brian McDade : It's on 22. David Simon : 22? It's certainly none of the category that is in our top 10 or top 20. So -- and as you know, our department stores don't pay -- really don't pay all that much. Well, you have the rent there in terms of what they pay. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Simon for closing comments. David Simon : Well, thank you, and we finished a little bit earlier. So I think, enjoy the rest of the evening. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

David Simon : Good evening. Thanks, Tom. Before turning to the results, I would like to provide some perspective on our company as we celebrated our 30th anniversary as a public company in mid-December of last year. We have grown our company into a global leader of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations managing through and in some cases, very turbulent times. Over the last three decades from our base of 115 properties in 1993, we have acquired approximately 300 properties, developed more then 50, and disposed of approximately 250 resulting in our current domestic portfolio of about 215 assets. We expanded globally, and today have 35 international outlets, including world-renowned outlets in Asia, and our portfolio is differentiated by product type, geography enclosed and open-air centers located in large and dense catchment areas. Our portfolio is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet and a top management team. We are the largest landlords, the world's most important retailers, and not by accident, our diversified tenant base has solid credit, our mix is always changing and adapting, best illustrated by the fact that compared to 30 years ago, only one retailer is still in our current top 10 tenants. Our team's hard work has resulted in industry-leading results including some of the following; our annual revenue increased from $424 million to nearly $5.7 billion, our annual FFO generation increased 30 times from approximately $150 million to nearly $4.7 billion, a 12% CAGR. Total market capitalization has increased from $3 billion to $90 billion. We have paid over $42 billion in dividends to shareholders. We have assets in our portfolio that have been in business for more than 60 years. Those assets are still growing today with many generating a $100 million in NOI. These assets are in great locations, have a loyal and large customer base that is where the retailers want to be. No other asset type has longevity including the NOI generation and embedded future growth that these assets have, yes, they change. Yes, they evolve, yes they adapt, but yes, they also grow. Our collection of assets cannot be replicated. And there are hidden - always hidden opportunities within that. I want to thank the entire Simon team, who have contributed to 30 years of success as a public company. And now let me turn to our fourth quarter '23 results. We generated approximately $4.7 billion in funds from operation in 2023 or $12.51 per share and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, FFO was $1.38 billion or $3.69 per share compared to $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2022, domestic operations had a terrific performance this quarter and contributed $0.28 of growth primarily driven by higher rental income with lower operating expenses. Gains from investment activity in the fourth quarter were approximately $0.07 higher in a year-over-year comparison, other platform investments at $0.03 lower contribution compared to last year. FFO from our real estate business was $3.23 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $2.97 from last year. That's 8.7% growth and $11.78 per share for '23 compared to $11.39 last year. Domestic property NOI increased 7.3% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending operational excellence delivered results for the year, exceeding our initial expectations. Our NOI ended the year higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 7.2% for the quarter and 4.9% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the quarter, fourth quarter was 95.8%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to last year. The Mills occupancy was 97.8%, and occupancy is above year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3.1% year-over-year and The Mills rents increased 4.3%, we signed more than 960 leases for approximately 3.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter. For the year, we signed over 4,500 leases, representing more than 18 million square feet approximately 30% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals, we're going-in rents of approximately $74 per square foot and renewals had going-in rents of approximately $65 per square foot. Leasing momentum for the last couple of years continues Into 2024. Reported retailer sales per square foot in the quarter was $743 for malls and outlets combined and $677 through The Mills. During the quarter, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG for gross proceeds of $300 million in cash and reported pretax and after-tax gains of $157 million and $118 million respectively. We opened our 11 outlet in Europe last year, construction continues on two outlets, yes, one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and yes, one in Jakarta, Indonesia. We completed 13 significant re-developments. And we'll complete other major development projects this year. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on five to six mixed-use projects representing around $800 million of spend from Orange County to Ann Arbor, to Boston, to Seattle, to Roosevelt Field, they are some of the ones that are planning to start this year. And we expect to fund these redevelopments to mixed-use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after dividend payments. During 2023, we completed $12 billion in financing activities, including three senior note offerings for approximately $3.1 billion including the Kl\u00e9pierre exchangeable offering. We recast and upsized our primary revolver credit facility to $5 billion and completed $4 billion of secured loan refinancings and extensions. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever, we have approximately $11 billion of liquidity. During 2023, we paid, as I mentioned earlier, $2.8 billion in common stock dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just over $110 per share in 2023, and today we announced our dividend of $1.95 per share for the first quarter and year-over-year increase of 8.3%. The dividend is payable on March 29 of 2024. Now moving onto 2024, our FFO guidance is $11.85 to $12.10 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions; domestic property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2023 of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions and cash balances. Contribution from other property, other platform investments of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share; no significant acquisition or disposition activity, and our current diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. So, with that said. It's safe to say, we're excited to enter year '31 as a public company. Thank you for your time and we're ready for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good evening, David. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about kind of the leasing pipeline and where things stand today versus maybe the year ago and what sort of conversations are you having with the tenants and maybe how the pricing dynamic changed there, given that you're now kind of 95% leased and pretty full in the portfolio. David Simon : Well, I mean, Steve, we're always adjusting our mix. We're always trying to - so even though we're 96% leased, we're always looking to improve our retailer mix and obviously, that's been beneficial to our NOI growth. I would say, just generically, obviously, I spend a lot of time myself on leasing and with my team on leasing. Demand remains very strong. And there is a real interest by all sorts of retailers and people that populate our shopping centers to be part of what we're doing it. So, I think as you probably saw our new deals are $74 a foot thereabouts, our renewals are $65 a foot, our expiring leases this year in the $56 - $57 range. So we're seeing generally positive spreads supply-and-demand is in our favor. Historically low supply in big properties across the country, I mean, there used to be 40 million square feet of retail real estate built every year, now there is essentially less than a few million here and there. So, and then there's been obsolescence too which makes the supply shrink as well. So - and then there's just great new retailers that we're very excited to do business with. I was on the West Coast seeing some of them. The importance of the bricks and mortar has never been higher. And the cost of all of the things that we said about, don't get me wrong e-commerce is critically important, but all of this stuff about e-commerce, cost of customer acquisition, returns, stickiness, et cetera, all continues to be a challenge. If you looked at the marketplaces, that pure online, they run into problems. So, you really - they really need to be connected to a bricks and mortar for survivability. So, all of those things are pointing to a positive picture, it's a function of execution. A function of being first a function of continuing to improve our properties, which we're very focused about, but now even though we've bounced back and had a couple of really good years in terms of lease-up from the depths of the pandemic, we're not finished and retail demand continues and it is strong and it's across the board. I mean, it's not one, category one retailer, but pretty much across-the-board. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, that's it. David Simon : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, good evening, everyone. David, could you give some more detail on the ABG sale that you referenced, maybe how much you still own, how much you think your remaining OPI could be worth, and whether you plan to monetize more in '24 or maybe what could influence that decision? David Simon : Sure, well let me just - we sold about 2% of our ABG stock. So, we essentially went from just under 12 to just under 10. And we'll continue to look to monetize these investments, they've been by and large, very good investments across, not just the big ones, but the smaller ones as well. Obviously, there's number of them that are synergistic to us. But, we have a strict adherence to creating value. And we think we can deploy that capital into kind of what I'd call the mothership and can get better growth from that and that's where our number one priority will be. So, it wouldn't surprise me, Caitlin, for us to continue to monetize, obviously, the - some of these are bigger value - bigger investment. So, it's not that easy to do it in one big swoop, but We're very focused on portfolio management of those assets and If we can monetize and are we going to get a better return plowing it back into our core business. Caitlin Burrows : Got it, thanks. David Simon : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. And first, congratulations on the anniversary. David, there is a lot of initiatives. So as you think about the next five years, I know it's probably difficult question, but Is there one or two key initiatives that you're most excited about as you think about the next five years? David Simon : Well, look, I'd say a couple of things. On the property level, there's no question that all of the mixed-use stuff that we're bringing in, plus the redevelopment of our department store boxes are probably the most interesting and exciting things that we're doing on the ground level. And so that would certainly be number one; number two is we're very excited about growing our outlet business in Southeast Asia. It's an incredibly robust market, young population and a growing - and I'm not, when I say Southeast Asia, I'm not like in Jakarta, places like that where it is not China, it is places like that where we see kind of what we can do in Japan and in Korea on the outlet side. Jeff you probably know that better than anybody. Based on your previous history with - in terms of that. So we - that's very exciting. I'd also say, we still are in the pursuit of bringing technology to our loyal consumers that allow them to handle enhance and their shopping experience with us. So, we've got a lot of initiatives on the marketing, loyalty. You know Simon search is a great example where our consumer either in property or pre-visit, can search our tenant base for what-if they're looking for a black dress where in this center can I buy it, what retail are obviously that ties into the marketplace we're building with premium outlets, there'll be some news there this year on that front. So, that whole system about customer interaction, reinforcing their shopping behavior, rewarding loyalty, expediting their trip to make it more useful is a big focus. And then as important, I think this is number four, really is just we've got to do a great job of continuing to evolve our retail mix. The exciting thing is, there are more-and-more entrepreneurs, there are more-and-more exciting retailers that are coming up with great concepts, proving them out, and then realizing that our centers are a good place for them to do business. So, those are the ones that come to mind, and I'm certain, there'll be ones that I haven't even thought of. Jeff Spector : Very helpful. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi, good evening. Good evening out there, David. So, I think at the opening, you mentioned that NOI is now exceeding pre-pandemic, the dividend is within less than 10% of pre-pandemic and sort of - thinking about Jeff's and Steve's questions on reinvestment, as you think about getting back to that pre-pandemic dividend level, given the investment opportunities, especially, lack of supply, growing demand, people are once again really engaged in physical retail. Does that change your trajectory as you think about getting the dividend back to pre-pandemic, meaning, are there better investment opportunities with that capital or is the delta really a function of rising interest rates that's, meaning that the surpassing pre-pandemic NOI versus the dividend is really just a function of the higher interest expense now. David Simon : Well I mean, Alex, look, our yield is ridiculously hot, okay. So, that's really where we could financially pay $2.10 tomorrow, right. So, we have $1.5 billion of free cash flow after dividends. So, it has nothing to do with financial wherewithal. I mean we like our - we would like - we don't like trading at this high yield. So I think, I think that's kind of how we look at it, we still think as we have these, additional capital events. We still are anxious to continue to buy our stock back. And again, when I look at either the S&P 500, I look at the REIT peer group, I look at, what the strip center REITs - our yield is plenty high for investors. So tell all my investors, I could pay $2.10 tomorrow evening, okay, per quarter without a blink and our yield is too high. And, it will be there before you know it, but we would like to trade at a lower yield, because we think, certainly if you look at it on that basis, our yield is higher than it should be I mean, the S&P is under 102%, our REIT strip centers, Tom are in the 4s. We're close to s7, right - 6.5 - 7. So. I mean Alex, you should be pounding the table. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, unfortunately, I'm a non-paying customer, the real customers are the ones listening to the call. We're just asking the questions. David Simon : No, I, I'm kidding. By the way, we're not - just so you know, we like you're welcome out there, we are west of the Hudson, but we're not going to tell you exactly where we are, okay? Somewhere in Indiana tonight, - we may not be in Indiana tonight, but we are west of the Hudson. Alexander Goldfarb : I assume you'll be in Las Vegas this Sunday. David Simon : Well, I can't tell you in my schedule. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon, and thanks a lot for taking my question. David, base minimum rents are up healthily in a low single-digit range year-over-year, while your tenant sales per square foot are down slightly. So, can you just talk a little bit about these dynamics. Is that a function of your range, kind of catching up to some of the street, the tenants have experienced before their sales have started to come down and just how long are these dynamics kind of sustainable like this? Thank you. David Simon : Sure . Good question, so I will say this. I think the rent - the going-in rents and renewals for new leases are very much sustainable. If you look at our occupancy costs, we are still at the low end of our historical range, and we're at 12.6% and we have run up to 14% plus before. And I would also, I would also caution report, these are the sales that our tenants are reporting to us, but they are somewhat affected by returns they it and so on. We actually think our sales per foot are higher than this. Some cases they have the ability to offset our returns in most cases, they don't. So, I just put that out there, so I wouldn't - and I mentioned this maybe two, three years ago, probably certainly pre-pandemic, but we report it. I know the market likes it. We actually think our sales were higher that come from our properties and then they are somewhat affected by returns. And we think some of - a lot of those returns are Internet sales returns. So, they don't even come from our properties. And so again, when we look at it, we feel like supply and demand, low occupancy cost, high retail sales, and just overall demand will be able to generate kind of the new leasing renewal spreads that we've seen over the last couple of years. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris, is your line on mute? David Simon : Floris. Looks like we lost for Floris. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Hi guys. Just - sorry. Just going back to maybe the reinvestments in here. You guys have plenty of cash after the dividend. And then just trying to curious at this point. What is the level of anchor box reinvestment you guys think you need to do just given what may be vacant today. And after you guys were spared kind of some of the recent Macy's closings. But just as you look at the portfolio today, kind of what do you think over the next two, three years, you guys could ultimately get back and have to re-tenant and just talked a lot about how the leasing environment is could. Just, what's the outlook for re-tenanting those boxes today? What's the targeted kind of make-up there and is luxury still doing enough to be able to be the primary kind of backfill option? David Simon : Well, on the - Craig, on the department store boxes, I don't have it off the top of my head, but the launch we own basically don't have a ton of work to do. We have a handful of boxes that we own that are in process, like for instance, I've mentioned Brea, but just briefly on the call, we did - that was a former Sears store we tore it down in development now under construction now. So the actual stores that we own are not many, probably under 10 at this point that are either currently under construction or in process. So, very small amounts of, kind of a less of an opportunity than you think. The ones that we felt Transformco still owns some boxes and so does Seritage. So you know well, in our properties. So, we'll see how that evolves. I mean, eventually some of those could be opportunities for us to buy and redevelop. We haven't made deals on those just because bid and the ask has been too great, but we - and I don't think luxury is really going to be the dominant theme on a lot of these mixed use - I'm sorry, on these boxes. I think a lot of it will be - continue to be a mixed-use development that we're doing. And obviously, opening up, if it's in a closed mall opening the center up with restaurants and entertainment and so on and it has worked very well. So, we have a number under construction or about to be under construction, but we don't really have that existing pipe that until we make more deals to buy some of the boxes back. It's not as big as you might think that it's only a handful. Now Macy's is right there, they announced some store closings none of which are ours. So, we're always very focused on knowing exactly where we might be at risk. And I would point out, very importantly when Sears went out of business, the whole market said, how are you going to survive, Sears going out of business. They had 800 department stores at that time, frankly they're down, I believe they were operating five, six, seven, eight. I think we actually have the most between us and the Taubman portfolio, but how are you going to survive, the fact of the matter is, it was a non-event to the mall customer, and If anything is we've gotten those boxes back. We've made the center better. So, as we look, we don't look at box - the changes in box as a concern, we view it really more aggressively and progressively. And that's something that will enhance the properties in the portfolio and the assets that we were worried about that couldn't survive that, basically don't exist in our portfolio anymore. So if you asked me that question 10 years ago, I might have a different answer. Craig Mailman : Great, thank you. David Simon : Craig, I hope you get better prior to the Citi Conference, I'm sure you well, but you sound like you've lost your voice. Craig Mailman : Yes. Hoping to be on the mend by then. Thanks, David. David Simon : You will. Operator : Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good evening . Could you help me better understand, how much incremental FFO, we should expect in '24 from development and redevelopment projects that stabilized either later in '23 or slated to be finished in '24, just any color to help us better understand the timing of incremental NOI and FFO from all the development activities would be helpful? David Simon : Yes, in fact, it's interesting you actually take us - I think in '24 we're taking a step back. I'll just give you a trivial example. And I mentioned, Brian now for the third time, but we have a whole wing that's connected to the former Sears department store that we're redeveloping. We'll have some outdoor shops, we're building Dick's Sporting Goods. We have a Lifetime Fitness resorts and then we'll do roughly 350 apartments or so, but that wing leading to Sears, we've had to de-lease it to ultimately put in, I am not sure, I am allowed to say it, but I'll say it anyway, Zara, Uniqlo and they won't open until end of '24, best-case. So. this advanced, by and large, all of this stuff in the U.K. that we've listed and I don't believe Brea's in the year if it is, just it will be there shortly. None that is really - affect that really gets in '24, we do have Tulsa opening in late-summer that will have a marginal impact leasing is going well. With all the redeveloping, this is really more of a '25 - '26 story. And the one that will see the benefit of this year and I have a number handy is 6, which we opened in '23. That's kind of the one that would say most meaningful of it. But most of the redevelopment is of '25 - '26 story. Vince Tibone : No, that's really helpful. I mean, is there any like for just in terms of the get the $1.3 billion that's active today, plus $800 million you're going to start. I mean what's the fair assumption for '25 - '26, in terms of level of maybe spend stabilizing, I mean I have to look at how we model it, like, is $500 million stabilizing annually at, we'll call it, 7% - 8% yield a fair assumption, or that's something I'm trying to get at like how quickly. David Simon : No. I appreciate that. If you don't include what I saw ground up, new development, I would say probably about between $600 million and $800 million a year and our goal would hopefully be to bring that in at north of eight. Obviously, if It is multifamily, you can still create value at a lower yield than that, and in some cases, we're building at a lower yield than that, like for instance both Brea's apartments and the ones that we're building at the former Northgate Mall, where we're basically about to start construction there, will be sub-eight. So, it may being round down that 8%, but if you're targeting kind of everything else, we would hope to be north of that. Vince Tibone : Thank you. That's all really helpful color. I appreciate it. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ron Kamdem : Great. Just a two-parter really quickly. Starting with the core NOI, just in '24, can you just touch on the tourist centers and how much recovery there is and how much upside for volume to '24 , as well as the variable to fixed conversion, just trying to get a sense of how much of a tailwind that is to the core. And then on the sort of other platform investments, maybe could you just touch on what seasonality should we be thinking about between sort of the first part of the year and 4Q . Thanks so much. David Simon : Sure, so - and Brian will chime in here. I will just give you some thoughts off my head and then Brian, hopefully, will agree or correct people. Three or correctly. So. I would say we saw in '23 really decent bounce-back from the tourist centers. I give you a great example. So, - and I was just happy to look at this having to look at this for now, I must have been probably doing my job. But, I noticed in Q4 as an example of the bounce back, the Woodbury Q4 sales were around $350 million. Sorry. Which to me is a real good indicator of bounce back and obviously, the highest fourth-quarter sales we've had zero in quite some time. So, I would say generally we're seeing a really good bounce-back in the tourist centers. I don't think we're the one area that the U.S. overall and obviously will have an impact on us. I do not think we'll see the Chinese. We do not expect the Chinese to come back the way they have beforehand before pandemic and they had - and just our tourist centers did outpace our sales for the portfolio for '23 on average. So, good bounce-back across-the-board and then I would on your variable rent, we continue to see that as lower percent revenues, both the vast majority as we increased our, the way to think about it and it's interesting is and again, hopefully Brian will need to correct me, but Brian's available to correct me. Our domestic operations at $0.28 of improvement Q-over-Q, that's $0.28, and within that $0.28, our variable income went down. So I think that gives you kind of a of a leading barometer, we're still working that way down and we're getting that into kind of our base rent. So and then your final on OPI, loss Q1 relatively flat Q2, Q3 and then most of it in Q4. Q2 is a little better than Q3 usual, but on the margins. And it's only growing projecting this year $0.10 to $0.15. Brian McDade : All right. Got it. Ron Kamdem : Thanks so much. David Simon : Thanks, Ron. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hi, good evening, David. I just wanted to dig into the guidance a bit and that OPI that you just cited in particular. Is it fair to assume that the $0.10 to $0.15 includes gains or monetization similar to last year or operations expected to improve from the minus $0.02 contribution to FFO in 2023? David Simon : Yes, thank you for that question and the answer is no, that's pure operations. And no one-timer or sale gains or any of that are in there. And yes - I mean - just by - I mean, we had a tough '23 in our OPI. We didn't meet our both our budgeted expectations and our expectations kind of mid-year when we re-calibrated it. The team in OPI, again we're partners with, so it's not just us, where partners are making significant efforts within their own business to improve performance. And again, the overriding theme was - and we should be sensitive to this across the board, the overriding theme was the lower income consumers still, with inflation embedded even though inflation has subsided, they are still dealing with things that cost a lot more money than they used to. And the good news is, their income is increasing, but it's still not in a position that they have the discretionary income that they need and they deserve. And, we need to figure that out as a country. Greg McGinniss : So just to clarify. David Simon : So no - yes, so I hopefully I answered. So no one-time gains, hopefully, we're being conservative and that's kind of where the numbers are. And yes, just to take a step back, we're kind of getting OPI in this level where it was pre the extraordinary year of '21 '22, if you go back in time, this is kind of where the number was already cleared. We had - we really outpaced ourselves that extraordinary '21 and '22 and I think now we're kind of getting back to more of a more stabilized number. Greg McGinniss : So, just to clarify, so there's going to be some improvements in operations I guess, that are going to be kind of driving this year-over-year growth. But what do you think that implies in terms of the operational standpoint and the customer for your other tenants in the portfolio. And how are those retailers performing and are they going to be able to make the same sort of operational changes to benefit income? David Simon : Well, you're just talking about our tenant base now is that the question or... Greg McGinniss : Your tenants, yes. David Simon : Okay, well, like I said, the ones of SPARC and Penny I really spoke to. I mean, I think generally, the plan with that they have in place we think we're on the right track and we're all working very hard to produce these results, and hopefully, we'll do better than that. Again, I mentioned to you, we're kind of getting back to where we used to be and if you looked at it in conjunction with pre-pandemic '18, '19, that's kind of where the number was. And we really outperformed in '21, '22. And we really underperformed in '23, simple as that. Brands are good. Businesses have the right game plan and we're moving. I would - so that's SPARC, Penny, questions on that. Greg McGinniss : No. David Simon : Then I'll move to your other questions. I mean. Here retail is very specific. So, I think our retailers generally and the credit is in really good shape. There's always one or two or three tenants that we are somewhat nervous about. But there - they all understand the importance of bricks and mortar, they're reinvesting in their stores. They're spending less on technology, which is good for us, putting more money back in the stores. And there are open to buy and return on investment in stores is a proven financial model. They're doing that. So I'd say generally comfortable, very comfortable with all the retailers that we're doing business with, but there will always be a couple of here and there that have to sort of through their financial issues. Greg McGinniss : Great, thanks for the color, David. David Simon : Sure, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Hong Zhang : Yes, hi guys. I guess, I was wondering if you could quantify the magnitude of the development drag this year. And also it seems like you saw a very strong rent and occupancy growth in the Taubman portfolio in the fourth quarter, measuring what drove that and what are your expectations for that portfolio this year as well. David Simon : Just on Taubman, and I mean, our expectations on the comp NOI are roughly right on in excess of 3%. What drove both portfolios really is supply and demand, multi-retail sales, operational excellence, all the things there I mentioned earlier. Listen, we're a big company, we did have some drag from redevelopment, but it's not, it's not an excuse. We don't worry about it, and it's not so much big redevelopment. You - when you re-tenant a mall you have downtime and as I've mentioned this before, the better the tenant, the better the build-out. And in some cases, build-out is six to nine months and restaurants it can be even close to a year. And as you know, we have - our portfolio restaurant new business is at least 100 new restaurants over the next year or so. So, it is a long, arduous process getting permits. I mean, we had a crazy thing in the Bay Area, where they couldn't hook up the gas for a while. Encourage you to read the Supreme Court, over-ruling an ordinance in Berkeley, that affected if you're really bored, you can read it. We finally got guests back into the year at center. And as you know, chefs like to cook with gas. So, it was - it cost us six months and the delay. I mean that's normal. But I'd say the bigger issue on just is not so much redevelopment, it is really re-tenanting and I would say by and large, if I had to it make-up a number, it costs this probably $0.10 to $0.20 a year, just downtime, but that's a guess. Hong Zhang : Got it, thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Just a couple of questions, first, your operating expenses were down in 4Q. I just curious what drove that and if that's sustainable. Brian McDade : Yes, Jason, this is Brian. Yes, we did see some savings on a year-over-year. There was some seasonality to it, weather was a little bit lighter. But yes, we do expect it's sustainable. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, and on the ABG partial sale, was it down around valuation versus the $18 billion mark previously? David Simon : Down. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Brian McDade : Yes, remember that that was the enterprise value, added some debt. So that was an equity value. But it was - just when you say $18 billion that's enterprise value as opposed to equity because. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Brian McDade : Sure, no problem. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, good evening out there. David Simon : How are you? Haendel St. Juste: I'm doing great, sir. Hope you're well too. Question I have is on your side, but not yet opened pipeline. I think last quarter or you previously outlined is about 200 basis points of embedded occupancy from that side but not yet open pipeline. So maybe you can give us an update on where that stands today. And then also maybe what's embedded in the guide for bad debt and lease term fees this year. Thank you. Brian McDade : So, Simon opens a little bit north of 200 basis points. We've been kind of holding that, we open stores and find new leases, so we're holding steady around 200 basis points. We are assuming a normal level of bad debt, which is about 25 basis points to total revenue would be our expectation on that. Haendel St. Juste: Lease term fees. Brian McDade : A normal rate of lease term fees. I think the answer - the number for the year is about $30 million. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. David Simon : Okay, thank you. Operator. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good evening. Just a quick one for me, just curious on the current state of affairs with Jamestown, and how that relationship is progressing more talk about mixed-use, so just curious if there's anything In the works or in the planning stages that you're doing with them and how you are thinking about that particular relationship. Thank you. David Simon : Yes, thank you. So, we haven't quite have the year under our belt, but very pleased with the relationship and the partnership and we continue to look at opportunities both within our pipeline and obviously, what they do on behalf of investors. So, a lot of good feedback going both ways and We we're working on one project. I mean we have one development project where we're working on together, but other than that it's a lot of corporate. There is - it is more strategic and more of a corporate discussion than property-level specifics other than one where we are partners on and going through the development process in that now in the Southeast. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to the management for closing comments. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. And obviously, Tom and Brian, are available. And we really appreciate everybody's participation. Talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

David Simon : Good evening. We're off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.33 billion or $3.56 per share compared to $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share last year. Let me walk you through some highlights for this quarter compared to Q1 of '23. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.09 of growth driven by higher rental income. Gains from investment activity in the first quarter were approximately $0.75 higher year-over-year. OPI had a $0.02 after-tax lower contribution compared to last year.  Funds from operation from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the first quarter compared to $2.82 in the prior year period, a 3.2% growth rate. Domestic property NOI increased 3.7% year-over-year. We have continued leasing momentum. Resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered these results that were above our plan for the first quarter.  Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.9% for the quarter. NOI from OPI in the first quarter includes a $33 million charge in one-time restructuring charges at SPARC and JCPenney. Excluding these one-time charges and a bargain purchase gain from Reebok transaction last year, NOI from OPI improved $5 million year-over-year and was on plan for the quarter. Remember, these retailers are on a fiscal year end of January 31, and the charges were part of the year-end closing process. They were not budgeted.  Mall occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.7%. Average base minimum rent for our malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year and at The Mills, 3.8% increase. Leasing momentum continued. As I mentioned, we signed more than 1,300 leases for approximately 6.3 million square feet. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We are approximately 65% complete with our 24 lease expirations, and we continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community.  Retail sales volume across the portfolio increased 2.3% for the first quarter compared to last year. Our tourist-oriented properties outperformed the portfolio average in the quarter with a 6% increase in sales. Reported retail sales per square foot in the first quarter was $745 a foot for our outlets and malls combined, which was flat year-over-year, excluding 2 retailers. Retail sales per square foot from our premium outlet platform reached an all-time high this quarter. Occupancy costs at the end of the first quarter was 12.6%.  Now, let me talk about other platform investments, affectionately known as OPI. We sold our remaining interest in Authentic Brands Group during the first quarter for gross proceeds of close to $1.2 billion and recorded a pretax and after-tax gain of $415 million and $311 million, respectively. The sale in the first quarter, combined with the sale in the fourth quarter, yielded gross proceeds of $1.45 billion. We generated substantial value from the ABG investment and a 7x multiple on our net invested capital during our short ownership period. As a result of the sale of ABG and the restructuring charges that I mentioned earlier, one-time in nature at SPARC and Penney in the first quarter, we now expect FFO contribution from OPI to be around breakeven this year compared to the initial guidance of $0.10 to $0.15. For your reference, we budgeted the -- at OPI, the FFO from ABG around $0.08 per share, so roughly half of that was associated with ABG.  Now moving on to new development and redevelopment. We opened an AC Hotel at St. Johns Center. We are opening Tulsa Premium Outlets this summer. Leasing is going great, and we have a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea this fall. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across our platforms in the U.S. and internationally as well with our share of net cost of $930 million at a blended yield of 8%.  We expect to start construction on additional projects in the next few months, including just shortly, our residential project at Northgate Station in Seattle. What's interesting for us is we're able to build when others need to rely on construction lending market, which is, as you might imagine, very difficult right now. We expect our starts to be around $500 million this year.  Now, on our balance sheet, we retired $600 million of senior notes in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. The dividend is payable on June 28. And given the transactions for this quarter and our results for this quarter, our current view for the remainder of the year, we're increasing the full range of our full year guidance of 2024 in the guidance range of $11.85 to $12 -- I'm sorry, let me restate that. We're increasing our range to $12.75 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.90 at the bottom end of the range and $0.85 at the midpoint.  Needless to say, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and our business and tenant demand continues to remain strong. Despite a cloudy macro environment, occupancy is increasing, property NOI is growing. We made a significant profit on our ABG investment, and everything is kind of moving in all the right directions.  Thank you. We're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Caitlin Burrows : Congrats on the solid quarter operationally and execution on the ABG sale. I guess there have been news reports that you could get involved in Express. So whether it's related to Express that's Simon's strategy going forward, can you give some insight to your current thinking on having ownership in brands, what type of terms are attractive to you and how you balance that with the potential earnings volatility? David Simon : Well, no one likes earnings volatility unless it's volatility in the right direction, okay? So Caitlin, thank you for the comments to start. But that's -- I don't like volatility either. Listen, on Express, we were approached by the IP owner. I think it's not overly complicated in the sense that they saw what we had done historically, both with ABG and SPARC and offered us to participate with no capital, but also add our expertise and our knowledge in what we've been -- what we've done in the past with SPARC. And because we have always valued Express as a retailer and as a client, we jumped at the opportunity. So we don't expect it -- we expect to be -- it's got to go through bankruptcy process, and that's out of our control. But if WHP does end up getting it, we'd be pleased to participate in the turnaround of Express.  And again, we don't expect any capital as part of that participation. So when we get opportunities like that, we evaluate it, we look at the brand and the value of the brand. In this case, we're comfortable that Express is a good company, and it's a great brand and we can add value to it. And given the fact that we were able to hopefully turn around the retailers, save jobs, create value from our investment, it's -- we see it as a win-win situation with no capital from our standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Elizabeth Yang Doykan : This is Lizzy Doykan on for Jeff. I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the key drivers of retailer sales as we started the year. And it seems like there's been some good outperformance from -- driven by especially your tourism-driven centers. So I'm just wondering how much that has been a factor into the first quarter of this year and how much upside there is remaining from tourism. David Simon : Sure. We feel very bullish on our portfolio in general. And then obviously, our tourist centers, especially in California and in the Northeast are starting to finally see the improvement that we have been seeing for quite some time in Florida. And Florida continues to be an unbelievably strong market as well. So we're finally seeing California, Northeast pick up. Obviously, the strong dollar vis-a-vis certain currency does have an effect, kind of an inhibitor effect. But even with that said, domestic tourism continues to excel.  And I think people, at the end of the day, they as part of -- when they go on holiday, they love shopping as part of that experience, dining, shopping, being with their families. And as I said earlier, I mean, we feel like the mall has made a big comeback, physical stores or where it's happening. We're seeing a resurgence and reinvigoration of that whole product. So we're pleased it's kind of where we're seeing things. So certainly, the lower income consumer has been under pressure now for quite some time. We're very focused on that. Obviously, inflation has taken its toll. And even though inflation is moderating, the prices that the lower income consumers dealing with are quite daunting. So we'll continue to see volatility in that area, we anticipate.  We're hoping that their cost of living moderates and to some extent their wages go up or their cost of living goes down, so we can see more discretionary income there. The higher-income consumer continues to spend and visits our properties, and it's good. And as a good example of that is our traffic for the first quarter, I think, was up around 2% for the year, right, guys? Unknown Executive : Yes. David Simon : So that's also a very good sign. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Samir Khanal : David, Brian, you provided a same-store guide of at least 3% last quarter. I guess, how do you feel about that guide today? You're doing 3.7% in the first quarter. Clearly, leasing has been strong, but we've also seen some announcements from Express, Route 21. I guess how do you feel about that guide today? David Simon : Yes. Look, we don't update that, as you probably know. I think you know. We don't -- that's our goal for the year. We don't update it every quarter as some others might. But we still feel like that's -- even though we've got some -- unanticipated to some extent, I mean, we do create bogeys on our rental income stream on retailers that we do feel might come under pressure in the year. So we do have kind of adjustments in our budgeting process dealing with those. We still feel like our initial guidance on that is very achievable. So we don't update it every quarter, but if we didn't feel like we could achieve it, I think we would highlight that. But we don't see that even with some of the -- I mean, we might not overachieve, as we always want to, but I think we can still deliver the initial guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Just a quick one on the $500 million development starts, if you could just talk about sort of the opportunities there? And do you sort of still see opportunities to go on offense on sort of the mall space given that fundamentals are coming back and that there is going to be peers looking to sell assets? Are there opportunities and appetite to go on offense on sort of buying more assets? David Simon : Sure. I think we've seen rates more or less stabilized now. There was a volatility prior to that where it was hard to predict. Now, we're not anticipating a reduction in rates, but at least we feel like we're at a more or less a stable rate environment. That makes it easier to make investment decisions, so I would break it up into 2 buckets. The first bucket being our redevelopment effort, and most of that, frankly, is mixed use in our properties, and we feel very bullish on that.  Remember, you're talking about bringing on -- if it's a 2- to 3-year process, you're talking about bringing on product in 2 to 3 years, not going to be any supply. We do a very good job of understanding the supply and demand. The new better product always wins. So we are unabated in our mixed use, and we'll be doing some multifamily development, both in Brea in Orange County, and as I mentioned, we just signed our GMP at Northgate Station to build about 300 units as part of that whole redevelopment.  So that really goes unabated, that when you get to the external new deal environment, I would say, we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us. And I think our job is just to prioritize, make sure we're valuing the opportunities, right, and we don't take our eye off the ball with what we're doing with our existing portfolio.  So long story short, I probably would venture to say that there could be more external opportunities for us. But again, it's got to be great quality at a fair price and have assets where we think our expertise can add cash flow growth to them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : David, you highlighted the health of the consumer. It seems like doing all right or managing through the environment. Just given your positioning, the occupancy gains and the pricing power that you have, if there was some sort of macro slowdown, do you think -- how do you think you would be able to navigate it or, maybe said another way, do you think the business has become a little bit less macro-sensitive as you -- as there's been consolidation and you've kind of become the place where you've reached consumers in that luxury space? David Simon : Sure. Look, we are -- make no mistake about it, we are not immune to macro -- the macro environment. So we would have to deal with it, both from -- if it ultimately led to less consumer spending and more retail client stress. We're not immune to it. However, and this is a big -- the big underlying from my standpoint, I have always felt like we've done our best work when others are dealing with the macro environment. So -- and as I mentioned, we have $11 billion of liquidity, in our comments earlier. So I think when and if -- and frankly, I mean, it's realistic to assume we may go through a reasonable slowdown here coming up. I think that's when we do our best work. That's when others get tired and throw in the towel. That's where we get rejuvenated. Hopefully, we're rejuvenated now, but this is when we really get motivated.  And as I think back, and I have had the luxury of being in the spot for 30 years, I think we do our very best work when the times get tough. So I'm not wishing that on us or anyone, but it's a realistic probability. We won't be immune for it, but I think we'll further separate this company from our peers. So that I know, that I have 100% confidence in that. If that does happen, we'll have further separation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : David, I just want to go back to Caitlin's question. In response to the retailers, you said that it brings a lot of volatility. Obviously, we all like volatility in the right way. But you can't deny that you guys have made a ton. I guess I could use a French word to describe the ton, but you guys have made a ton of money, billions from these retailer investments. Yes, they are volatile, but they've been lucrative. So I just want to get a better sense, is the express model sort of a future where you guys will participate if you put in no capital? Or just trying to understand how you weigh the money that you've made versus the short term or the quarterly earnings volatility because clearly, it's been a source of success for you. David Simon : Yes. That's -- it's interesting, Alex. It's a very good question. And I think, honestly, we really focus on -- to the extent we do put in fresh capital, we -- in addition to understanding what it means for our overall business, and the totality of our company, it's also absolutely driven by return on investment, just like building a new shopping center.  And again, yes, we have volatility, but in the scheme of things, again, and the fact that we've made money, I hope most folks are understanding that the volatility is really on the margin. And I'll just give you a good example. And again, we take -- FFO, as you know, is net income plus depreciation. Well, the contribution we get from our retailers is net income, which is fully burdened by depreciation, so there's no add back. But to give you a simple analysis on just ABG as an example. So we cleared $1.450 billion of cash. And that produced about $0.08 of earnings because we just picked up our share of net income. We only got -- we only as a shareholder, they are only -- we only would get tax distribution. It's a subchapter as essentially. So we'd only get our tax distributions, which amounted to $2 million a quarter. So that's $8 million. And if you take the $1.450 billion and you invested in a bank at 5.5%, that's $70 million. So we went from $8 million in cash flow to $70 million, just selling that.  So we look at every aspect of it, pretax, after-tax, what does it mean to the portfolio, what is -- we don't want volatility, but we'll have -- we'll certainly accept it if we think it's going to be a good investment. And it all kind of goes into the analysis. We understand the market is not thrilled with it. So we try to also do it in a way that really does not make it the store. It is on the margin, and it will always be on the margin. But we do think we can add value to the enterprise by some of these investments. And each investment is so idiosyncratic that it's hard to say -- again, if Express happens, it's hard to say that, that's the new model because -- I don't know that I can say that, I think every one of these things is somewhat idiosyncratic, but we do have the opportunity to do more than lease space in Alabama someplace. That's what this company is all about, we do more -- we're in South Korea, we're in Jakarta, we're building in Tulsa, we're building apartments in Seattle.  So -- I mean I'm waxing a little bit here, but I -- we think of ourselves broader than I think the market thinks of us, that's incumbent upon us. And I think our disclosures have gotten better over time. I hope you read, Alex, on OPI, so you could see it, not to track from real estate, but at the same time, we're somewhat different than when you line us up to others that do some of what we do. Alexander Goldfarb : And that was the point that you guys have this special thing. It's sort of like Kimco has their retailer unique thing, and it would be a shame to do away with it if it was just volatility because clearly, it's made you a lot of cash. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Nicholas Joseph : It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, I just wanted to ask on kind of the opportunity and -- to roll out additional luxury, either VIP suites or retailers, we saw what you did at Woodbury. And I'm just curious on the opportunity for the remainder of the portfolio and what kind of demand do you think that will drive from some of these higher income clientele that you're seeking. David Simon : Listen, I think we've got a great portfolio of real estate that is focused on the very high income consumer. And I think we need to step up our game in all the services that need to be provided to that consumer. And I think Woodbury, Sawgrass are just the beginning of an effort to really -- I can't think of the right word, but really entertain that consumer to make it really special. And it's all the services that they're accustomed to, it's the fine dining, it's the ease of access, it's right -- having the right retailer mix. So we probably have around 20 to 25 properties that are -- that have this high -- our centers are really big, so they obviously appeal to a broader range of consumers, which is the way we like it because -- that's also you diversify the ebbs and flows. But that -- but those 20, 25 centers really need special attention. We've got a great team that's dedicated to them. And in many cases, we're the preferred or certainly a meaningful landlord to the best retailers in the world. And we want to -- we definitely want to stay in that spot. So a big push for us to step up our game when it's dealing with the very high-end consumer on all sorts of levels.  And so I think what happens at Sawgrass with the Oasis and The Colonnade and what already happens at Woodbury, but we're just stepping up our game, will happen at Houston and King of Prussia. And if you saw what we did at Phipps in Atlanta and what's going on at Boca Raton in Florida, just to name a few that jump out at me, is really, really a high priority for the company. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Floris Gerbrand van Dijkum : David, I was going to ask you about luxury, but I was pipped so instead I'm going to ask you about capital recycling. Presumably, your guidance -- I mean, you just -- you've cleared $1.2 billion on the ABG sale, sitting there in cash. And obviously, you do have some ongoing development, but that was essentially funded from your retained cash flow, if you will. So the guidance assumes that is that cash sits there uninvested essentially for the rest of the year? Or is there further upside, I guess, is what I'm getting at if you were to do something else with that cash and to redeploy that into higher-yielding investments? David Simon : Yes. Very good question. In fact, we cleared in 2 months $1.450 billion, as you know, Floris. So I just wanted to mention that. But yes, right now, our guidance just assume it sits in the bank and/or pays down debt. But that's basically it. So no really -- no real redeployment is contemplated in our numbers at this point.  Brian, if you want to add anything? Brian McDade : Yes. No, that's right. We've just assumed that we would hold the cash for the time being. And we have debt maturities coming due here in September and October. And so we could use the cash on hand to fund that. We also were carrying cash from our activities -- from our capital markets activities last year. So the combination of it will address our upcoming maturities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Vince Tibone : Could you elaborate on the charges taken in the first quarter related to SPARC and JCPenney? And then possibly related to that, kind of what is your near-term outlook in terms of JCPenney store closures, just given foot traffic trends in recent years has not been great? So just curious how long you think the current store count and fleet is sustainable? David Simon : Yes. The charges pretax were $33 million, so not -- most -- it's kind of funny -- because you know most charges were in the hundreds of millions of dollars, so -- yes, I think you have to put it in perspective. But with that said, it really dealt with personnel and inventory. So that were the 2 primary factors and more really on the inventory side because we had some clearance of inventory that in SPARC it was really focused on F21 and Penney just on basically clearing out some inventory. So Penney -- we're pleased with Penney. I'll just talk a moment about the store closings. They're very interesting. They don't -- Penney is able to produce positive EBITDA even if there's no -- not high sales, I think they do out of the box. So I don't really -- in fact, I think Penney always can be a beneficiary opening new stores as opposed to closing stores. I'm sure there will be a few here and there, but most all of their stores are positive EBITDA. And so they have a very good way of having positive EBITDA out of what I call low-volume stores.  And again, this is what's interesting to us, Penney is not public. So you know what matters to me, Vince, cash flow, EBITDA and that, obviously, sales -- comp sales are important, right? But as long as we're profitable out of the stores, there's no Wall Street pressure that we've got to narrow the store count. I don't necessarily believe shrink to grow. It's very hard to achieve. Maybe you can achieve it. It's -- my history, not overly long, but long enough, it's -- I don't care what industry, it's very hard to do. Some have done it, but the -- but to me, if it's that positive EBITDA, there's nothing wrong with maintaining that store for the community. You certainly don't want to lower standards of how you operate it, but if you can create cash flow, doesn't necessarily mean you have to reinvest that much in it, and you can use that cash flow to reinvest in other elements of your business. So I don't anticipate -- long story short, I really don't anticipate much portfolio real estate activity at the JCP level. Vince Tibone : That's really helpful color. Maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I'm just curious, given the ownership structure, I mean are you guys able to pursue recapturing some of these boxes at your best properties to unlock mixed-use development opportunities? Or how would that work given your foot ownership with Brookfield? David Simon : Yes. Well, look, I think as part of the deal originally -- first of all, our relationship with Brookfield is excellent in our -- we both basically -- and ABG is an investor in there as well, but we very much see eye-to-eye on JCPenney and how it operates and how we should operate it. And I would say both of us, and now, my memory is a little bit cloudy, but when we did the restructuring, we did get -- both of us got the opportunity to reclaim certain space from JCPenney that we could redevelop it.  So it's a good question. And the fact is we are about to embark upon, one, that you'll see an announcement in the near future where we are going to ultimately redevelop a JCPenney at one of our centers. So I don't remember the exact count. I don't remember exactly how much Brookfield, but as part of the bankruptcy process and negotiation with each other, we did give each other the right to do that. And so what happens there is we get notice to the company, it's already documented, then we get the -- we -- and we can -- in this case, it's a lease. So there's nothing to pay. We just cancel the lease.  Now, obviously, store is a little bit profitable, very profitable for JCPenney. So we're going to have to find them some new opportunities to make up for it, but that's all part of the deal. So I think there'll be a handful like that, both from us and Brookfield that we'll be able to do. But -- and again, that was all prenegotiated. To the extent that there's one that wasn't part of that negotiation, that's pretty -- given our relationship with Brookfield, pretty straightforward, we come up with a value or they come up with a value. Obviously, the JCPenney management team would have to be part of that. And they would get the appropriate value to redevelop that project. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just hoping to ask about the watchlist or bad debt. I believe you said you had assumed 25 basis points last quarter. Has that changed now at all? And if so, maybe if you could break out the Express impact. And in your prepared comments, you talked about sales on a per-square-foot basis being flat, stripping out 2 tenants. Just curious on the color of why those 2 tenants were stripped out, if there's any interesting development? David Simon : Yes. Let me answer that. I think the 2 tenants -- I mean, even if we didn't -- I think it's just color for you to know that generally, the portfolio was flat. We don't like to name tenants, so we don't focus on it. I'd also, I think, point out to you, the most important thing we look is total volume, and we were up quarter-over-quarter. What was the number again? 2.3%. That's really the number we look at. And again, remember, these are reported sales. We can get into this whole diatribe about some of the retailers credit their sales with Internet returns. So it's just information, okay? Do what you want with it, but it's just information.  But our sales, if you include the 2 retailers, the last 12 months was down 1.8% on a rolling 12 basis. But total, because not all those are comp total, was up 2.3%, which is the more important number. Now, we'd also -- just to -- and Brian can add in here. Now that I'm talking I might as well just finish. We don't -- as part of our discussion, we don't -- we'll never get into a retailer-specific response.  But obviously, bankruptcy for tenants has a lot of -- a lot goes on, leases have to be rejected and depending on where they were on that and what happens. So we -- in our comp NOI, we have our bad debt expense. I think I gave you some color. We still feel like it's achievable. So -- but again, I don't think, and Brian can add, we're not going to really give you a color too much on Express, but we do put in -- when we model our business for the year, we do put in unforeseen circumstances. And we try to budget appropriately for retailers that are under pressure. In this case, we kind of knew Express was in that spot. But a lot remains to be seen how Express comes out of bankruptcy and the ultimate financial impact. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: A quick 2-part here. First, I wanted to follow up on Floris' question on the uses for the cash on the retail monetization. The stock is $35 or so higher than what you lost back, so I assume it's fair -- that it's fair to assume that buying back stock is less likely here. And are there any special dividends that need to be paid on that game? And then my second part of the question is we noticed that the TRG property count dropped to 18 properties versus 20 last quarter, what happened there? David Simon : I'll let Brian, you can -- I hope you can answer all these. I expect you to... Brian McDade : I can. With respect to TRG, there were 2 properties. One was a partner buying out our interest, so the property count went down by 2 in the quarter. With respect to... David Simon : Tell him the 2. Brian McDade : Fair Oaks and Country Club are the 2 assets that when -- the partner is buying us out or bought us out. With respect to capital on the balance sheet, certainly, it's a capital allocation decision relative to stock buyback. But we -- with the amount of capital that we are generating, both free cash flow and what's on our balance sheet, it is still an appropriate use of capital throughout the balance of the year and would expect that we would have interest in buying back our stock at certain levels. David Simon : Yes. And I would just add to that, the ABG sale happened, I don't remember exactly, but near quarter end. And we were blacked out from that because of Q1 earnings. So I wouldn't read that the fact that it's sitting on the balance sheet to read too much into that. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate that. And the special dividend, anything on that front... Brian McDade : There is no required special dividend. These were -- this interest was owned in our taxable REIT subsidiaries. So there will be a tax, actual payment due, not actually a special dividend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Yu Tsai : A 2-parter. I appreciate the fact that you won't provide capital to Express, but could you just give more color on how you would be providing assistance to the brand? David Simon : Well, I think obviously, there is a couple of elements, the first -- the most important one is that we have the history of running a retailer coming out of bankruptcy. So I think -- for better or worse, I think it's better, but others may not agree with me. There's a certain expertise in doing that, and we've -- we had. And I think what our potential partner sees on that is that, that we can bring to the table. So I wouldn't underestimate that. That's one.  Number two is, as part of any bankruptcy, we're going to have a lease negotiation. Some leases will get restructured, some won't. Some will pay what the existing rent is and so on, so -- but that happens regardless of whether or not we're involved or not. So that's just part of the bankruptcy process. We go space by space and find out -- we kind of find out what we'd like to do, maybe short-term leases, so on and so forth, but that -- but we're not alone in that. Any other landlord will have to come to their own conclusion on what they want to do, if part of rent adjustment is necessary to get the brand on solid financial footing. Linda Yu Tsai : And do you have any clarity on the store closures at all, because one of your much smaller peers expects to close 65% of its stores in 2Q? David Simon : We are not involved in that process. That's really management. So I have no point of view or no opinion on that at all. That whole process is part of -- we really won't get involved until we're approved as the stalking horse bidder. So that -- all that's going on today with the depth and everything else is all part of -- it's all the existing management team. We have no involvement in that whatsoever. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Hong Zhang : It's Hong on for Mike. I guess I was wondering, can you give us an idea of where -- of what kind of CAGRs you're seeing most of the demand from in your malls? Is it -- I'm just wondering if it's broad-based and/or how much of it is apparel versus the other categories? David Simon : Honestly, it's across the board, restaurants, entertainment, athleisure, sports-related -- it's the bigger boxes, the UNIQLOs, Primarks of the world, Zara. It is -- this is where I give a shout-out to Rick as he used to go through it. But we're seeing it -- Abercrombie were doing a lot of new opportunities with Mango, Golden Goose, just to name a few; KnitWell, JD Sports, Alo, Lululemons growing with us, upsizing a lot of properties. Our House is a great company that we're doing business with, pinstripes, number of restaurants, restaurant tours. It's very, very, very encouraging because it's so diverse. Hong Zhang : Got it. If I could sneak 1 other question. And I guess the $745 square foot sales, is that portfolio weighted or NOI weighted? David Simon : Portfolio weighted. I'm sorry, just portfolio, pure. If it was NOI weighted, where we used to do that, it's like $950 -- higher. Brian McDade : $950 plus or minus, basically. David Simon : Okay. $950, thereabouts. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : David, just on looking at the volatility of the retail investments, what are the drivers to keep SPARC and JCPenney on balance sheet as opposed to the ABG investments? And would you look to sell those in the near future? David Simon : Well, again, they're equity accounted, so they're really not on our balance sheet just to make us clearer. So they're investments in them. Listen, they are -- we built a company where everything is core and nothing is core. So we saw ABG, we got an offer, we hit the bid. I would view that for any and all assets that we have, whether it's JCPenney, SPARC, XYZ mall. Call Uncle David and not -- most people don't hit my bid, but the only thing that's core is the company and its people and its balance sheet, but every other assets were sale at the right price, so nothing is critical long term. And again, look, guys, we're talking about volatility, and the reality is the volatility has been mostly on the upside. And again, we're a company that earns $12, and we're talking about $0.10 here or there. So I just want to put everything more or less in perspective. But there's nothing that I wouldn't sell at the right price across the company and worldwide, period, end of story. Because -- and it's very simple. You know why? I think because if we got the cash, I know we would find an appropriate investment that would replace the earnings lost, it's really that simple, or we give it to the shareholders or we buy our stock back. So I am at the point of the highest level of indifference about monetizing an asset as you'll see. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. David Simon for any closing comments. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. Sorry, we -- I know it's the end of earnings season, we're always late in the Q1 because we tie it to our annual meeting next -- on Wednesday. But thank you for your interest and your questions, very good questions. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon, David Simon : Good evening, everyone. I'm pleased with our financial and operational performance in the second quarter. We are seeing increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains, shopper traffic, and retail sales volumes resulted in the company's highest level of real estate NOI for the second quarter in our company's history. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and steady. Our company is focused on creating value through unique and disciplined investment activities that will continue to deliver long-term growth and cash flow, funds from operations and dividends, as you've seen by our recent increase in our dividend per share. And importantly, make our properties better for the communities in which they operate. I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian, who will cover our second quarter results and the full-year guidance in more detail. Brian McDade : Thank you, David. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.09 billion or $2.90 per share compared to $1,800 million or $2.88 per share last year. FFO from our real-estate business was $2.93 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.81 in the prior year, a 4.3% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.12 of growth. As a reminder, the prior year included a non-cash gain of $0.07 from investment activity related to ABG. Domestic NOI increased 5.2% year-over-year for the quarter. Continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered results exceeding our plan for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.8% for the quarter. Malls and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 95.6%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year. The mills occupancy was 98.2%. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year and the mills increased 3.9%. As David mentioned, leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,400 leases for approximately 4.8 million square feet in the quarter. Approximately 30% of our leasing activity in the second quarter was new deal volume. Our traffic in the second quarter was up 5% compared to last year. And importantly, total sales volumes increased approximately 2% year-over-year. Reported retailer sales per square foot in the second-quarter was $741 for the mall and premium outlets combined. We hosted our third Annual National Outlet Shopping Day in June, and it was very successful for shoppers and for participating retailers. More than 3 million shoppers visit our premium outlets and mill centers over the shopping weekend. Feedback from shoppers and retailers following the event has been great. Since launching this unique event three years ago, participating retailer and shopping momentum has built each year with more than 475 retailers this year, and we look forward to an even bigger event next year. Our occupancy cost at the end of the second quarter was 12.7%. Turning to new development and redevelopment. We will open our Tulsa premium outlets on August 15th at 100% leased and we will also open a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea this fall. We also started construction in the quarter on our first phase of a new luxury residential development at Northgate Station. This project will include 234 units and adds other elements that further transforms Northgate into the ultimate live, work, skate, stay and shop destination. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across all platforms in the US and internationally with our share of net cost of $1.1 billion and a blended yield of 8%. Now to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 10 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of approximately $1.1 billion, an average rate of 6.36%. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Turning to the dividend, today, we announced our dividend of $2.05 per share for the third-quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7.9%. The dividend is payable on September 30th. And now finally for guidance. We are increasing our full-year 2024 guidance range to $12.80 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint and reflects overcoming approximately $0.15 per share from certain retailer restructurings, lower lease settlement and land sales, land sales income this year. With that, that concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you. David and I are now available for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed. Jeff Spector : Great. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. David Simon : Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Spector : Yes. My first question -- I guess my only question at this point, I would say circle back in. I guess let's focus on the consumer, given you service to the consumer across various formats from the malls to premium outlets to mills, what is your latest thoughts on the consumer today? Clearly, the market is panicking that we may see a consumer-led recession. And maybe if you could tie it to what you're seeing from retailers and how they're acting today? Thank you. David Simon : Sure, Jeff. This is David. I'll take that. So look, I think we've been pretty consistent for well over a year that the lower-income consumer has been under pressure for quite some time, primarily because of the inflation that's affected them. So that continues to be the case, they are very focused on managing their bills and discretionary expenditures have been obviously not where we'd like to see them. So we're optimistic that we're going to cycle out of that from the lower-end consumer as given the inflation picture that we see now, which is relatively benign. It's way too early, Jeff. We haven't seen a slowdown in the higher-end consumer. Obviously, the market is in an interesting point. We have not seen the wealth impact at all impact that higher-end consumer. So we're still pretty sanguine about it. I think, as you know, we kind of budgeted at the beginning of the year flat sales. We're a little bit above that. So we've got a little bit of cushion. But the higher-end or the better end-consumer, I think is in a good spot. Your liquidity is in a decent spot. So we don't expect anything dramatic. But obviously, they're going to take their cue from now what's going to happen in the overall market and what the employment picture looks like. So in summary, I think we're going to cycle more positive in the lower-end consumer and I think the higher-end consumer steady as she goes currently. Yes, Jeff, you can always ask another question, but Tom Ward has put a pretty tough restriction on people. Jeff Spector : No, thank you. That's all be respectful. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Samir Khanal : Hi, David. I guess what are you seeing in terms of leasing or pricing power? I mean, are you seeing any tenants taking a bit of a pause or taking a bit longer to sign new leases given what's happened with the macro and I guess any color on July would be also helpful in terms of traffic or sales? Thanks. David Simon : Yes, I don't have color on July. We don't really get those numbers until August 20th, which is my birthday by the way, but it's usually 20 days after the month so no early returns on that. So we had a deal committee meeting, Brian, a week ago and what I am told that I don't participate in these because I would probably be disruptive, but what I am told, it was the best new deal committee in we've had ever. So I think what we're seeing is demand and what I said earlier in my opening remarks, demand is strong and steady, not abating. It's really unabated. Obviously, retailers and so we're all sensitive to economic conditions. So as those develop, we have to be sensitive to them. But as we currently speak, we had a great deal committee and the team is working in all cylinders. So that's kind of the news from the front. Samir Khanal : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. Maybe just following up on that retailer demand side. So portfolio occupancy has increased nicely over the last year. It sounds like leasing remains strong. You just mentioned the best new deal committee. So that would support further occupancy increases. I'm just wondering versus the current 95.6%, how much further upside do you think you have? Or is there some reason to expect this rate of increase can or cannot continue going forward? Brian McDade : Hey, Caitlin, it is Brian. I think we're pretty comfortable thinking that we're going to end the year north of 96%. Certainly still a little bit of noise out there, but given the robust demand in the type of environment we're in, we think we're north of 96% by the end of the year. Caitlin Burrows : I mean, again, yes. David Simon : I'm sorry, I was just going to add that I think obviously, it's also not just the occupancy number, it's also replacing retailers that aren't performing with better retailers. So it's a mix issue too, which the team is very much focused on. Go ahead, Caitlin. Caitlin Burrows : Yes, I was just going to say bigger picture, like, Brian, you just mentioned north of 96, is there any reason to think maybe based on what David said, that's kind of a ceiling or there could still be continued upside potential? Brian McDade : Well, I'd be cautious and that's a pretty good number for us year-end. Tom knows every number, but he's [indiscernible]. So it's a pretty good increase from last year, 95.5. Not that good at that. So maybe there's upside. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good afternoon. And David, certainly good to hear you on the call. Hope the recovery and all the stuff is going well. Just a question for you big-picture. Jeff kicked it off and a number of -- my peers have all asked the same question. But as we look at the environment today, certainly there's a lot less retail availability. There's been a big shake-up not only among the retailers themselves, but also the landlords and certainly cost for new development has gone through the roof. So as you look at the picture today, with the economic concerns, but also at the same time that the tenants seem to be in better capital positions. Are you as worried today when you see weak economic data? And does that impact the way you think about expanding, putting money to work and how the leasing conversations are going? Or do you think that we're in a better situation or worse situation? Like how do you judge where we are now just given that the environment seems to be different than it has been over the past few decades. David Simon : Well, thank you, Alex, for the thoughts. And let me just answer your question. So I frankly think that listen, it sounds like I'm, talking our book, which obviously you would expect us to do, but we have never been better-positioned. So if we do -- so I don't look at the -- that the current uncertainty and even a potential recession no one wants to go through that but given how we're positioned I think we're in an absolute unequivocal position to improve and better our company. So again, we don't want to go through recession, but if we do, the gap between us and everybody else just gets bigger and bigger. Our gap, if you look at kind of where we started three years ago and where we are today, the gap is pretty damn big, it will only get bigger and that's a testament to the team and everybody else. So -- and honestly, I'm not looking at a current potential recession or tough market as any basis to slow down. I look at an example, we just started construction in Northgate, building 234 [projects] (ph). And we expect to do another phase of that probably in the next nine months as we go through the pricing. So from our standpoint, we're not slowing down. And if the economy slows dramatically, the gap between us and just about everybody else will only get bigger and that's -- that gives us opportunities to do some interesting projects. Alexander Goldfarb : And you see the same confidence from your retailer, from your partners, your tenants or are they're waffling? David Simon : I think the better retailers that are -- we have a number of retailers that are in really good financial standing and I think they take a longer view just like we do. Not everyone, but I would tell you the majority of who we're doing new business with is definitely taking a longer-term view. So they're looking to gain sales and market share as well. So we're certainly not on the defensive into the kind of the turmoil over the last few weeks. And if anything, we'll step up our investment activity, but not foolishly. I mean, we'll do it like we do everything else, but we don't see it as a reason to rain in at this point. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You continue to drive nice NOI growth driven by both occupancy gains and higher rents. Now we've talked a little bit on the call about occupancy potentially approaching a potential ceiling. So do you see increasing pricing power with that to maybe offset that? I'm just trying to get a better understand of how the algorithm kind of looks in the coming quarters? Thanks. David Simon : Well, again, occupancy is like any statistic people want. And again, to be clear, we do think we'll increase our occupancy. The bigger opportunity for us is again to continue to increase better than mix. So -- and that drives, obviously the better the mix, the higher the sales, the higher the sales, the more likelihood that you're going to have higher rents. So that's the big focus as we continue to merchandise our properties. Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything to here. Brian McDade : Yes, Michael. Look, we continue to see pricing power. Roughly rents are similar where we've seen an escalation last year that we talked about rents in the 70s for new deals. That's continuing. And as we find more-and-more retailers and update the mix to drive demand and ultimately drives our pricing power. So there's a recurring premier relative to that. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed. Craig Mailman : Hey, guys. Maybe shifting gears a bit on to the balance sheet and just the rate environment here. Just your thoughts generally with a three, eight, 10 year. If that's at all changing your view on kind of the upcoming debt maturities in the back-half of the year and how to fund those versus how much cash to keep on hand versus, David, maybe your commentary about the gap between you and others, your ability to be on the offensive to make investments now that if we do go into recession by the time they're done, you're kind of on the other side of it and you're well-positioned. So I'm just kind of curious, I know it's a broader question, but just how kind of the softening rate environment here, does that change anything you're doing or how you want to be positioned on the margin? Brian McDade : Craig, it's Brian. Look, one day doesn't really change our financing plans for the year. We're sitting on $3.1 billion of cash. We had $1.9 billion in maturities in the back-half of the year. Current plan is still to refinance those out with cash on hand. But to the extent we were to see opportunity to do alternatively or the market opened up with tight spreads, certainly, we could access the market in the back half of the year as well. But no current plans to do so at present. David Simon : Yes. And I would just say, look, we got $11 billion of liquidity, so obviously a lower interest-rate environment does increase our earnings potential. There's all sorts of things associated with a lower interest-rate environment, but by and large, that's beneficial to real estate. So if that's the case, that's going to be better than what we planned initially for this year and what we were thinking for next year. So that's good news in a nutshell. But again, remember, we got -- we're not living, mortgage to mortgage, we're a different kind of company. So we don't have the Holy Toledo, I'm going to say another word, Holy Toledo, we can't refinance this mortgage. So anyway, so -- but by and large, if rates go lower, that's better for this company. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. Juan Sanabria : Thanks for the time. And David, I hope your recovery is going well as well. I'm just curious on the investment front, you clearly sound more bullish or wanting to invest more capital in debt and re-debt. But just curious about external acquisitions with the statement that you said that you're only going to kind of widen the gap between yourself and others. Would that make you want to wait because there's going to be better -- a better maybe spread down the road between your performance and those of others or not necessarily? David Simon : Well, it's a good question and that's when I would just say judgment comes into play. I mean we have been as you know, right, because if there was any material, we disclose it. We haven't really done anything external for quite some time and we're going to just be looking at quality stuff where we can add value that's appropriately priced. And up until this point, frankly, we haven't found it. So that doesn't mean that we're discouraged, but we'll keep doing that because that is an element of what this company is good at. And we would like to add quality where we could add value at the right price and if it's not at the right price or if it's not at the right quality, there's just nothing there for us to do. We're not -- we're basically out-of-the portfolio business. So that as far as I can see, I mean things change, but I just don't see us buying another big portfolio that where we'd have to swap off a handful of properties. So we're really going to be selective and -- but again, it's going to be at the right price. And if we can't get it at the right price, then we've got plenty to do and that will keep our liquidity and keep doing what we're doing. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Best wishes to you, David, as well Mike. Just a quick one from me. Just could we double-click on some of the strength that you talked about in the portfolio, but maybe breaking it down between maybe malls versus outlets or some of the tourist centers as well would be helpful. Brian McDade : Well, Ron, I think you're seeing broad-based demand across all of our platforms. So it's difficult to kind of give you an individual kind of thumbnail into it. But certainly, we see -- we over-index in our outlet business, certainly towards international towards and that's still very strong for us. That's a driving factor kind of in our outlet business results. But certainly, the retailers are doing business across all three formats. You're going to say the highest occupancy ever. So the demand is broad-based from all retailers across all three major platforms of ours at this point. David, I don't know if you want to add anything? David Simon : Yes. It's kind of interesting. I just don't think there's like a unique trend, so it's not Florida or Texas, it's not outlets room halls, it's not enclosed versus outdoors, it's really very property-specific and I would say that the quality and the good stuff is getting better and it's almost our traffic which is a good indicator was pretty much across the board. So I think there's no unique -- unlike COVID where when you came out of COVID, it was Florida and Texas kind of the smile states and whatever, I think it's really the -- it's really property-specific. And it's not -- so you could have a great property in X, Y, Z city and a not-so-good one in X, Y, Z city and they're a tale of the two stories. So I really think the -- I really think it's property-specific. And I don't think there's any one particular trend to focus on at least in this quarter. You might have a better sense of it by year-end and see how things shake out, but not right now. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, thank you. And David as well, I wanted to wish you best wishes and hopes for a speedy recovery here. My question tonight is, I wanted to go back to the strong and broad-based demand you mentioned you're seeing for space across the portfolio. I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on the size of the backlog of leases that are coming online, maybe some color on the timing of that? And is there also any update you can provide on the 3% or the at least 3% domestic NOI growth from last quarter for the core? Thanks. Brian McDade : Hey, Haendel, it's Brian. As we think about demand, we've got a signed but not open pipeline of about 300 basis-points. You heard David talk about mix and so we are moving some tenants around. So that's not all just additive. There'll be some coming out-of-the bottom of that for sure. But that's just a further indication of the work that our team has done in demand for space to have 300 basis points signed, but not open pipeline for us. So really, really kind of that defines or kind of really gives you a really good sense of the breadth of what's out there for us as far as demand for space, Haendel St. Juste: 3% at least? Yes 3% max? Brian McDade : As you know, we don't update that as we go. We established it at the beginning of the year, and to see that our best to exceed that number which we have thus far. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you Operator : Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed. Vince Tibone : Hi, good evening. How much do you think changes in the stock market impacts consumer spending at the higher-end? Just from your experience over the years, like at what point does stock market volatility really start impacting consumer behavior and consumer sales? David Simon : I think it's more -- that's a -- I wish I had an algorithm. I don't, but I'm sure we could get AI to do something for us. I would -- my history would suggest short-term fluctuations mean absolutely nothing. But over time, if you had a down-market for six or nine months, you're going to rein in consumer spending. So I do think it's going to have to take the downward trend or the negative -- the volatility is not going to really impact the consumer in the next short period of time. But if you see it for several months, then I would expect us to see some slowdown in consumer spending. So it does take time to see, but I think that the consumer is used to seeing some volatility and they have some probably built-in gains that they never thought they would have had, right? So when companies get valued in trillions -- I remember when a $50 billion market cap was did, when companies get valued at trillions of dollars, and that's a lot of retail, I hope those retail investors are smart enough to sell and then spend the money in our malls, I mean that would be a good cycle for us, okay? So I think even if these levels were in pretty good shape, if you have a -- if you have kind of a longer downturn, then it's realistic to think that consumer spending is going to be reined in. But offsetting that obviously will be, low inflation, lower interest rates and you can -- you could potentially see a scenario that we dealt with pre-COVID, right? So it's -- if there's a lot of variabilities out there. And -- but I don't think short-term fluctuation is going to have an immediate impact. Vince Tibone : It makes sense. If I could maybe ask one quick follow-up along those lines like just how should we think about the sensitivity of Simon's cash flows to tenant sales? I mean, with all kind of the COVID changes, it seems like most of that's unwinded at this point. But kind of just, yes, is there any guidepost you can share of like how much rent or how much of your total revenue rather is made up of overtime percentage rent or just how much volatility is there on your business from if tenant sales were to be? David Simon : Yes. Look, I'll -- Brian may have a number. I would just say big-picture, a lot less coming out of COVID, but higher probably than pre-COVID. And so I don't know what perspect that is, Brian, if you don't, well, we could probably give that number to you. But it's certainly a lot less than when we started in COVID, but higher than probably pre-COVID. Brian McDade : We'll follow-up offline, Vince. Vince Tibone : Great. Appreciate the time. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good afternoon. David, we share birthday, so I'm pretty excited about that. But my question, first -- David Simon : How old are you going to be? Greg McGinniss : No, you really want me to share that? David Simon : No, no, no, not at all. Greg McGinniss : So we noticed that the overall same-store NOI growth this quarter was healthy and but largely driven by the consolidated portfolio. We had international NOI was down 1% year-over-year. JV revenues down about 4% versus last year. Is there anything in particular that's impacting the international and JV assets this quarter? And do you expect to see those return to year-over-year growth in the back half? Brian McDade : Greg, from an international perspective, Greg, last year, we did recognize a one-time performance fee in our McArthurGlen business to some third-party managed capital there. So that did not repeat this year. So that's why you see a decline in that line item. That will normalize itself just by sheer operation going forward. Greg McGinniss : Okay. David Simon : Yes. I would just say our international assets both in Asia and in Europe are pretty much on plan if not a little bit better. So [indiscernible], as you know, reported last week to better results. And they're obviously nicely positioned going forward. And Europe and Asia is some movements in the different countries, Japan having extraordinary growth because of the yuan, a couple of other markets flat. But generally speaking, international -- this got good -- as Brian mentioned, good comp NOI growth this year and pretty much on budget. Greg McGinniss : Okay, thank you very much. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed. Floris van Dijkum : Hey, thanks. Glad to hear you're doing well, David. You sound great. Question on Value Retail. I know you guys own a stake in that. It's sold at an incredibly low cap-rate to Catterton, who I think is the investment arm of LVMH. Could you maybe talk about maybe -- and I think that's -- it's a different market, obviously, but if you could talk about the cap rates environment in Europe versus here and maybe also the long-term nature of some of these big luxury brands? And do you see them putting money to work at those kinds of cap rates? I mean, I guess they have already on Fifth Avenue, but in the mall business as well in the US in your view? David Simon : Well, let me -- thank you. Let me try to unpack that a little bit, okay? So, for us, let me -- I would say, first of all, L Catterton are very smart investors and Value Retail is a unique structure. So I don't think you can look through their investment that was at a significant discount to NAV to get to a cap rate without really having intimate inside knowledge which you or I don't have, okay? But they're very smart investors and I don't think this is a -- so that's the first point I'd like to make just on that question. Second is I think, again, it depends on what brands you're talking about, whether it's luxury or higher-end or whatever, a better moderate. Every retailer is different, everyone's looking to increase their sales and every brand is different. So it's you cannot paint a luxury investor by one broad stroke. So and even within some of the larger groups, their brands are different. You may have one brand growing, one shrinking, what have you? I don't expect, and again L Catterton is also owned by the principals of Catterton. So it's not just the group. I don't think there is a trend for them to suddenly invest, got some money in retail real estate, but I could be wrong. And I think it really depends on each brand and what their strategy is. Floris van Dijkum : And if I may follow-up, I mean, are you having -- how are your discussions going with your institutional partners here in the US in the mall business? Are they -- are those partners happy? And would you -- are there opportunities for you to maybe buy some of them out or are they pretty comfortable owning some of those top malls that you typically JV with them? David Simon : Well, I would say overall, we hope that our relationships with our institutional partners is excellent. And again, it's -- there is very hard to paint a broad brush. I would say by and large, most are very complementary, very happy to be our partner. There's always an asset here or there that may not fit with them long-term, but I would say generally, it's kind of business-as-usual with our institutional investors. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed. Linda Tsai : Hi, good afternoon. On the 300 basis points of signed but not occupied, what does that represent in dollars? What's the timing of that coming online? And would you expect this to compress going into next year? Brian McDade : Linda, most of that's going to be back-end weighted to -- there'll be a little bit this year. Most of it will really manifest itself next year just given where we are in the year and how retailers traditionally position their store fleet to get most of it open before we're back-to-school holidays. So most of it is going to be back-end weighted for next year -- front-end weighted for next year, excuse me. Linda Tsai : And would this signed but not occupied be down year-on-year at the end of next year from where you sit today? Brian McDade : It's really difficult to predict what's going to happen 12 months from now. So it is what it is right now. Ultimately, as we continue to kind of move through, we've seen some consistency in that number and some increase, right? We were talking about it is about 200 basis points a year-ago. So we would see an increase over the past 12 months to get to 300 basis-points. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And what's that represent in dollars? Brian McDade : I don't have that number in front of me here. David Simon : Yes, that's usually not something that weren't. That's something we're not going to really disclose because then you add all leases up and annualize the number, but it's a big number. Linda Tsai : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Muller with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Mike Muller : Yes. Hi, David, we're glad you're on the call as well. For the question, TRG's year-over-year base rent growth looks like it was over 8% in the second quarter. Can you talk about what's driving that growth? Brian McDade : It's just a mix of the deals that they're doing at the assets they're doing, Michael. So they're doing some better leasing at their better assets and that's really coming through the average rents for that period of time. Not every space is creates equal, not every asset is created equal. So they're seeing great wins at their best assets that have the best pricing. And it's not a small portfolio. So you're getting a bigger percentage. It's a smaller portfolio, a much smaller portfolio than ours. So you're just getting a bigger percentage jump from it. Mike Muller : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. And good to see you sounding better, David. So just curious, if there was a consumer downturn, could you discuss how your portfolio might perform today versus a few years ago? I realize the tenancy might have changed significantly over the years towards less apparel, more services, restaurants or other uses. And trying to look at this from a sales sensitivity standpoint versus maybe a credit sensitivity standpoint, because I can understand those two things might be different. David Simon : Yes, sure. I'll take a shot at it. So I mean historical recessionary times. And again, we're not in that camp just yet. I mean you call me in two months and we might be. But I would say our NOI cash flow tends to flatten out. It's very obviously there's so many variables that go into it, but I hate still talking about COVID, but we really didn't see other recessions, really didn't see cash-flow from the properties go down, they flattened. I would think not knowing exactly if and what kind of recession it is and how hard and how deep and all that other stuff. It would be hard to give you a number other than to say history would indicate our cash-flow was relatively flat. We weathered pretty nicely because what happens is tends to happen as big-ticket items tend to go in the back-burner and the stuff that we sell at our properties tends to maintain itself. So that would be the best guess at this point, but it is almost impossible without kind of knowing exactly what kind of market that we're in. But again, we're not in that camp yet. And we might be later on in the year or whenever but I would think our cash flows would be relatively flat assuming it's -- you just -- it's hard to say what a typical recession is anymore, but I would say that's probably the best guess at this point. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you, David. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, again, this has been a very efficient call. I guess maybe on retailer bankruptcies Express and Rue 21 were retailer bankruptcies of 2024 and I'm guessing you have had exposure from a rent perspective to additional smaller ones also that maybe aren't as obvious. So could you comment on how the outcomes of the 2024 bankruptcies on Simon's financials have ended up versus your expectations and then give a broader update on the current watchlist and going forward? David Simon : Well, I'll just say you know in Brian's remarks, we definitely have a decent impact from the retailer restructurings. I mean, also we have a little lower lease own income, a little lower of land sales than we had budgeted. But if you put those three categories together, it's about $0.15 that we had planned on being there that aren't there this year. So obviously, we factored in the Express restructurings and rule and so on. So those numbers are reflective of our new guidance. It doesn't reflect if there's a material new one coming up, but we don't -- we haven't -- we don't know of anyone that's on the road. So, Brian, you can add whatever you want to add. Brian McDade : Yes, watch list continues to be relatively flat. Those things that have happened, we had a thought that they would and it planned ahead. We don't really see much on the horizon at this point. No new additions in the watch-list at this point. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. And then maybe one more if I could. Just the contribution to the portfolio from the retailers. I think your latest comment was for a flattish contribution in 2024. So just wondering if there was any update to that and maybe like your visibility or confidence in the back-half of the year? Thanks. David Simon : Well, look, I think we continue to work through it. It's -- if you look at that whole, Penney, Sparc, RGG, Jamestown, we basically have around $200 million plus or minus EBITDA in that kind of OPI bucket now that APG is out. And it'll be plus or minus a couple of cents here or there. So because again, we have accounting, we've got lots of depreciation. You don't know that fast and the brands within Sparc, the lower-income consumer continue to fight through a tough market for that consumer. So there's not a lot of new news other than the team at Sparc is working very hard. The new stuff that they're buying is working but it continues to be a very competitive marketplace. Caitlin Burrows : Okay. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Brian McDade : Thank you, David Simon : I think this wraps it up. Let me just say to everybody, thank you. I got a lot of well wishes during this tough time for me and I'm working at it and appreciate all your support and we'll talk in the near future. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I am pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good morning, everybody. And I\u2019m pleased with our financial and operational performance in the third quarter. We saw increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains and total retail sales volumes. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and steady and we continue to strengthen our unique retail real estate platform through our growing development and redevelopment pipeline. This, combined with our A-rated balance sheet, really sets us apart and allows us to focus on the future. We raised our dividend again to $2.10. We\u2019re now at our historical high, overcoming the arbitrary capricious closing of our real estate during COVID. We have a low payout ratio. I\u2019m going to now turn it over to Brian, who will cover our third quarter results and full year guidance in more detail, Brian. Brian McDade : Thank you, David, and good morning. Real estate FFO was $3.05 per share in the third quarter, compared to $2.91 in the prior year, a 4.8% growth rate. Domestic and International operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 of growth, driven by a 3% increase in lease income. Third quarter funds from operation were $1.07 billion or $2.84 per share, as compared to $1.2 billion or $3.20 per share last year. Third quarter results include $0.13 per share of non-cash net loss and fair value adjustments from the mark to market on the Kl\u00e9pierre exchangeable bonds we issued in November of 2023, which mature in November of 2026. The non-cash loss on derivative is due to the outperformance of Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s stock price, which increased 18% during the third quarter. As a result of the stock appreciation, the market value of our Kl\u00e9pierre investment increased by approximately $400 million during the third quarter. OPI was an eight cent loss in the quarter due to reduced discretionary spending by the lower income consumer at two SPARC brands and also from the loss of income from ABG in the prior year due to the sale of our interest earlier this year. As a reminder, the prior year results include $0.32 per share in non-cash gains from the partial sale of our ownership in SPARC in the third quarter of 2023. Domestic NOI increased 5.4% year-over-year for the quarter due to continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered the results exceeding our plan for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our International properties at constant currency grew 5% for the quarter. Malls and Outlet occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 96.2%, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year. The Mills occupancy was 98.6% at the end of the quarter. Average base minimum rent for the Malls and Outlets increased 2.3% year-over-year and The Mills increased 4.5% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed approximately 1,200 leases for 4 million square feet in the quarter. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have signed more than 3,900 leases for 15 million square feet, which is expected to generate more than $1 billion of revenue. We have an additional 1,800 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for more than $600 million of revenue. We continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength for many categories. Reported retailer sales per square foot was $737 for the Mall and Premium Outlets combined, and was up approximately 1% year-over-year, excluding two retailers. Importantly, total sales volumes, excluding those same two retailers, were up approximately 1.5% year-over-year. The end of the quarter, our occupancy cost was 12.8%. Turning to new development and redevelopment, we opened Tulsa Premium Outlets on August 15th at 100% lease and we also opened a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea in September. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across all platforms in the U.S. and Internationally, with our share of net cost of $1.3 billion at a blended yield of 8%. Turning to other platform investments, our OPI results for the third quarter at SPARC underperformed as the lower-income consumer continues to be more cautious in their spending. We first highlighted the inflationary impact in the second half of 2022 relative to this consumer. Performance was below expectations at Forever 21 and Reebok. SPARC and J.C. Penney did, however, record sequential improvements in comp sales during the third quarter, which sets these brands up well for the important upcoming holiday season. We are not sitting still and we expect to have some positive announcements by year end with respect to these businesses. Turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter, we amended and extended our $3.5 billion supplemental revolving credit facility for three years on existing terms. We also issued $1 billion in senior notes with a term of 10 years and a 4.75% interest rate. This was clearly good timing on our part. During the first nine months of the year, we completed refinancings of 14 property mortgages for a total of approximately $1.3 billion at an average rate of 6.13%. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.1 billion of liquidity and at the end of the quarter on October -- subsequent to the end of the quarter on October 1st, we repaid our last remaining unsecured maturity for 2024 of $900 million. We constantly innovate in both our physical and digital worlds to create world-class convenience for our shoppers and drive incremental sales for our brand partners. In continuing this effort and building upon the success of Shop Premium Outlets, we rebranded our digital marketplace ShopSimon to take advantage of all of our assets, including shopper email lists totaling over 25 million customers. The expanded and rebranded digital marketplace adds on-sale and discounted merchandise while continuing to offer Outlet products from leading brands. This is the next phase in our journey to create the ultimate omnichannel experience. We also launched a new nationwide marketing campaign, Meet Me @themall. The campaign celebrates the shopping mall\u2019s continued cachet as the go-to destination for all generations. Turning to our dividend, today we announced our dividend of $2.10 per share for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 10.5%. The dividend is payable on December 30th. This is the fourth consecutive quarter we have increased our dividend and the dividend is now back to our pre-pandemic record high. Finally, turning to guidance, we are affirming our guidance range of $12.80 per share to $12.90 per share, which excludes $0.14 per share year-to-date impact of the non-cash loss and steer value adjustments from the mark-to-market on the Kl\u00e9pierre exchangeable bond, which prior to the third quarter was only a $0.01 net non-cash loss, but is now $0.14 and needed to be highlighted. With that, thank you for your time today. David and I are now available for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, David and Brian. It sounds like you\u2019ve got great momentum on the leasing front and with the portfolio north of 96%. I\u2019m just curious how you guys are attacking the lease expiration schedule over the next couple of years and whether you feel like pricing power is moving materially in your favor, just given the interplay with sales being a little bit flat, but obviously there being strong demand for high-quality retail space? David Simon : Yeah. Steve, I\u2019ll answer that simplistically, I guess. I would say that our job is to continue to improve the merchandise mix at our real estate and so it\u2019s more than -- it\u2019s a lot more than just what rent you can charge. It\u2019s really what is the right retailer, tenant, et cetera. What\u2019s the right mix for that property? And we take more of a holistic approach to how we re-merchandise centers. We\u2019re still undergoing significant re-merchandising across the portfolio, because we\u2019re seeing better retailers. When I say retailers, it could be restaurants, et cetera. I\u2019m using that as a generic term. We\u2019re seeing a lot more interesting and better retailers that are interested in our portfolio. So we need to take advantage of that and that\u2019s the focus. So obviously, supply and demand. I mean, construction costs are up 60% from pre-pandemic numbers. I mean, a pretty staggering number. We\u2019re basically one of the few that can build and overcome that. So there is no real new supply and that does put us in a positive light. But our job is to make the properties better and not just focus on the highest rent per square foot we can get. So, with that, we have a balanced approach. Obviously, we think we still have growth as leases expire or we bring in new tenants. But I don\u2019t -- I really don\u2019t like the term pricing power. I really don\u2019t like the focus on that. Just how do you continue to make the portfolio better is really the number one focus for our team. We just literally had a three-day marathon session. We go property-by-property with our leasing folks. We did the Malls this week. We\u2019ll do the Outlets and Mills next week. And if you participated in it, I think I offered somebody one time down the road to who was it? Alex, probably? Yeah, Alex is the only guy that would want to sit through it. But if you sat through it, the primary focus is how do we make the property better? We still have work to do there. But I think at the end of the day, when you do that, you\u2019ll get the property growth that we\u2019re all looking for. So I would characterize it that way, Steve. The good news is supply and demand is in our favor. We have the capital to invest in our portfolio to make it better, overcome the unbelievable rise in construction costs when you think about it and that\u2019s the focus. Steve Sakwa : All right. Well, I\u2019m free next week if you want me to sit in on the meeting. Thanks. David Simon : You\u2019re more than welcome. You get to choose Outlets or mills, right? Let Tom know, okay? Steve Sakwa : All right. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Brian McDade : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Caitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David, you mentioned a growing development and redevelopment pipeline. I was wondering if you can go through how deep this opportunity is for Simon\u2019s portfolio now, considering all that you\u2019ve already done. To what extent is there still potential for anchor replacement or other retail redevelopments and then also the larger mixed-use projects? David Simon : Yeah. I think that continues, Caitlin, to be a huge focus for us. So I would -- our pipeline is probably around $4 billion right now. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to do all of it. But we have massive mixed-use opportunities ahead of us and we still don\u2019t have all the anchors redevelop the way we want to. So we have opportunities at like a Barton Creek or down the line, if you looked at some of the Sears. Fashion Valley is a great opportunity where we\u2019re going to get the J.C. Penney space back and probably do about a $500 million redevelopment between retail and mixed-use. Our residential pipeline, as an example of that, is over a $1 billion today. And without including kind of the Fashion Valleys or the Barton Creeks of the world that we think could do residential. We continue to see an interesting relationship between residential development adjacent or part of or existing retail format. They actually go hand in glove. It\u2019s very encouraging to see. I think if you listen to Don Wood, he\u2019ll tell you the same thing. So that is exciting. We\u2019re going full steam ahead. As you know, that supply, it\u2019s probably, in certain markets been oversupplied, but the reality is nobody building now. And if you think how we\u2019re looking at it, it\u2019s going to take two years to three years to four years, and as we bring these on, there\u2019ll be no new supply. And I think that\u2019ll put us in a in an advantageous situation. So long story short, say $4 billion and roughly a third of that is probably resi. Brian McDade : Let\u2019s throw one off. David Simon : Let\u2019s throw one off. But some office, like for instance, we\u2019re -- we just approved a deal and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in our, in our 8-K, but we just approved a deal at Clearfork, which is in Fort Worth, kind of a newer center and we just approved a deal with our partner to build an office and retail on the ground floor. The office is going to be, I don\u2019t know if I can say it, but basically, we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s not big -- it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, 50,000 square feet and Wells is going to take the majority of it. And so we\u2019ll still do smatterings of those kind of projects as we go forward. But building a big spec office out of our pipeline. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. And just to confirm, I know in there, you were talking about retail office, well, not so much office and the multifamily, you mentioned at one point in there over building that was on the residential side, correct? Brian McDade : Correct. David Simon : Correct. Yeah. Correct. Caitlin Burrows : Got it. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. Maybe just following up on the first question topic, David, your comments on merchandising mix, maybe something else that is sometimes overlooked. I know you guys talked about your -- the omnichannel experience and what you\u2019re doing there, Meet Me @themall. Can you expand a little bit on some of the key initiatives that the company is doing to, again, engage customers, bring them to the centers, and how this may evolve over the next few years? I know, of course, this holiday season, you have some great programs? Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Sure. So, I would say, Jeff that, the Mall continues to be a unique gathering place. And we get -- I think we all get too focused on whether it\u2019s enclosed or has a roof on it. I mean, it really -- to me it really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s kind of what is the best retail project in that training area. And we believe that, and if you talk to, really new and exciting companies like Ascian or other, SKIMS or kind of the new wave of retailers/marketplaces. They all believe in our product. And so -- and we\u2019re seeing a rejuvenation of the younger consumers wanting to hang out at the Mall. I think it\u2019s our obligation, both for us and our investors, et cetera. And also for the retailers to really highlight that. Now, we don\u2019t have unlimited budgets, like, the tech companies, right? But we try to do the best we can to reinforce that, hey, this is cool. Now, at the same time, digital is important, right? So 14%, 15% of our commerce is digital and we think we can play a role in that. We think the best way to do that is through ShopSimon. We made sure we had proof-of-concept before we put kind of our brand on it. If you remember, it started Shop Premium Outlets. We floundered around until we partnered with Michael Rubin and RGG. We\u2019ve created -- we hired some top-notch talent there. We\u2019re building our marketplace. We had proof-of-concept. And then we decided to rebrand it under ShopSimon. So, we do think, and then, ultimately, this will add, we\u2019ll hang a loyalty product on that, which will be important. And then, ultimately, we have Simon Search, which will hang on that. And we\u2019ll end up with ship from store, pick up at the Mall, et cetera. So it\u2019s, the flywheel is starting to fill itself out. But in the meantime, we want to reaffirm the positive nature that our product means to the community, means to our retailers, as we grow on. And we can\u2019t ignore digital because, well, let\u2019s face it, this is around that 14%, 15%. It\u2019s not growing the way it used to, but we have to assume it might. So we have to play in there. And I think with ShopSimon, we\u2019ve got the right product. Our retailer relationships and faith they have in us gives me confidence. We have the right team. We have the right partner. And RGG, I think, gives us confidence that, we\u2019ll continue to create real value out of that platform. But it\u2019s not overnight, it takes time, takes investment, creative investment and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed to your question. David Simon : Hi, Craig. Craig Mailman : Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up on the ShopSimon concept, David. As you guys are looking to re-merchandise Malls and there could be some more anchor fallout over time. I mean, is the idea here to hopefully get this up and running to where you guys can convert part of the Mall to last mile distribution and be able to bring that logistics angle to your business to help your retailers and also be able to monetize it or am I reading a little bit too much into it? David Simon : Well, I do think there is absolutely a role that we can play in search at your local store that happens to be in our center. And then maybe there\u2019s a distribution angle and certainly pick up in store is an angle that we can help facilitate with our retailers. Whether we\u2019ll build a mini distribution center or not, I mean, we look at those things and there\u2019s possibilities of certain retailers or certain centers that, we might be able to do a micro or mini distribution facility. We\u2019re also looking at last mile in the power area because obviously that\u2019s going crazy and that, there is -- our real estate is unbelievably well located and it does --it is not -- we\u2019re not out in the hinterlands and last mile is very important and we\u2019re usually have real estate that\u2019s, A1A. So, there\u2019s possibilities. It\u2019s not going to be dominant or whatever. It\u2019ll be selective, but there are potential possibilities. Craig Mailman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hey. Good morning. Hey. Congrats on the strong leasing quarter crossing 96% in occupancy ahead of\u2026 David Simon : Yeah. You\u2019ve broke up there. Greg McGinniss : \u2026go for your functionally full. David Simon : Well, look, I think, we can still increase our occupancy, but also beyond occupancy, and I said earlier, it\u2019s really, we\u2019re really focused on merchandising. So -- and but we still have room to grow our occupancy, but more important is that, bringing in the right tenants, in the right center, in the right location. That\u2019s a huge focus for us. But we still think we have plenty of opportunity to grow our occupancy. Greg McGinniss : Okay. Thanks. And just one quick one on FFO per share guidance. We\u2019re trying to better understand the successful year contribution from real estate as opposed to some of the noise that\u2019s generated by other platform investments. Are you still anticipating around zero cents from OPI or is that lower now and maybe offset by better real estate performance? Brian McDade : Greg, it\u2019s Brian. I think we now think the OPI contribution is going to be a minus 5 to minus 10 for the year, but it\u2019s being offset by significant improvement in the real estate FFO extension. Greg McGinniss : Okay. So overall\u2026 David Simon : Let me -- we expect it to improve in the fourth quarter, for sure. Greg McGinniss : Right. But I guess, overall, I think my takeaway is that the real estate business guidance would be increased this quarter if it were standalone. David Simon : Yeah. If we -- if OPI is, you\u2019re breaking up, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s our phone or yours, but OPI has been a drag this year from an FFO point of view. Now, remember, we essentially have four assets in OPI, okay? We have our investment in RGG, we have our investment in Jamestown, we have our interest in SPARC and J.C. Penney. When you put it all together, we have positive EBITDA in those business of a meaningful amount, but again, when you own an interest in a retailer, you\u2019ve got lots of depreciation, lots of expenses that end up hurting FFO, but not necessarily the EBITDA line. So, I just want everybody to put in that perspective. And again, I would also mention to you that, our investment in both Penney and SPARC is de minimis at this point. We have a little bit more investment in RGG and Jamestown, but the size of our company is the right thing to do. So, with that said, and Brian said in our call, well, we are still not standing still on our retail side, which is Penney and SPARC, and I do think we\u2019ll have some positive announcements with respect to those businesses near year-end or early 2025. So, we\u2019re working hard on that. But the bottomline is it has been a drag this year. Part of that drag was because we sold ABG, so we lost that income that we thought that we -- when we gave you our budget, we weren\u2019t anticipating. We\u2019re extremely happy with that sale. So that was the right thing to do at the right time. And --but so we tackled one opportunity, we\u2019re tackling the next. We view RGG and Jamestown as long-term investments at this point. Obviously, that can change, but we view those as long-term investments. And again, so, and if you go back in history, which I think is important, when we got into the retail business, it was the right thing to do at that particular time. We are less -- given today\u2019s time, it\u2019s probably not the right thing to do and that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t done a retail investment in a few years, four years. So, we\u2019re smart, we get it, but we\u2019re focused in, we have an investment that\u2019s worth something with no capital in it, so our job is to make it better and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Greg McGinniss : Yeah. thank you. David Simon : A little, yeah, a diversion from what you wanted, but I give you the full story, okay. Greg McGinniss : All the colors appreciated. Thank you. David Simon : No worries. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. David Simon : Ron? Looks like we lost Ron. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey. Good morning out there, David, and yeah, I\u2019ll happy to coordinate with Tom and Steve on sitting in on one of those leasing sessions with you. David Simon : Well, we\u2019ll do it. You might -- you\u2019ll either be fully impressed or you will -- the detail might overwhelm you, so we\u2019ll see. Alexander Goldfarb : I look forward to being overwhelmed. So question, David, just getting back to the commentary on the 96% plus leased performance of the portfolio and the comments that you\u2019ve made about the opportunity in the Malls. As you look at the bottom tier, for a long time you talked about the bottom 20% driving cash flow to reinvest in the top Malls, but given how competitive the retail environment has become, lack of new supply, are you seeing new opportunities in your bottom 20% of Malls that previously you would have just harvested for cash flow, but because of the changing landscape you now see opportunities that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago? David Simon : That\u2019s a good -- that\u2019s a really interesting question and a good point. I think based on, if you asked everybody on the last three days of the Mall portfolio, we absolutely, not every asset in the bottom tier, and again, we -- I don\u2019t like that phrase, but I\u2019m going to use it anyway. I would tell you, if you talk to our team, our leaders in that area, Jon Murphy and Eric Sadi, Rick, God love him, still loves to go through it, and John Rulli, et cetera. I would say to you, one of the real opportunities for this company is to improve the bottom 20, and because you\u2019re right, there\u2019s no new supply in those markets. Just like human nature, we always want to work on the second half, right? So, I do think there\u2019s a real potential to improve that, because in many cases, we\u2019re the only game in town and given lack of supply and our ability to reinvest, I do think we can make real strides in the bottom tier, again, not every asset. But the majority plus of them. So, that\u2019s a big focus going into 2025 without question. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. David Simon : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris van Dijkum : Good morning, guys. Thanks. Question on the leasing. By the way, I thought the response to Alex\u2019s question was fascinating, by the way, because we believe that, the B malls or the lower-quality malls, financing might finally be coming back to that market now, too. But maybe if you can talk about your S&O pipeline. Last quarter, you mentioned it was 250 basis points. How has that moved? I saw that HERM\u00c8S just opened up its store in Phipps, and what percentage of that S&O pipeline is luxury in your view? Is it meaningful and are there other Phipps-type luxury projects planned in the portfolio going forward? David Simon : Yeah. Let me, yeah, interesting question again, and I would say, I have it right in front of me. I used to. But here, okay, so we have executed 75 new luxury deals covering 208,000 square feet and we have another 47 out for signature. So that\u2019s kind of a total out there at this point, but again, we\u2019re increasing that every day as we speak. So, yeah, we, even though, the sales for certain brands has slowed in that area. They are continuing to commit and for us, as you know, I mean, the build out and the time for those retailers to open is probably compared to kind of a traditional retailer is longer, but we\u2019ve got a very impressive pipe on that with a lot of square footage that will open over the next few years and growing to this day. Brian McDade : And Flores, the sign but not open number is about 300 basis points. And importantly here though, as you\u2019ve heard David talk about multiple times, this is about merchandising mix. So this isn\u2019t all incremental. We\u2019re swapping out underperforming retailers with better retailers. And we do have retailers making commitments well into the future in that number as well. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks guys. David Simon : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. Could you provide some color on the cadence of stabilization for the development and redevelopment pipeline? Specifically, if you could share, how much incremental NOI are expecting in 2025 from the pipeline on a net basis, all the openings this year and next offset by any, just rubber downtime with new projects, that would be super helpful for forecasting? Brian McDade : Yeah. Vince, we think we\u2019re ultimately going to deliver about 30% of the portfolio investment in 2025. So, against the 8% on lever deals. I think you get back into the estimated income contribution from that -- those data points. Vince Tibone : And is that like an average then or I think that it\u2019s like 30% on average will stabilize because like stuff that, delivered the third quarter, for example, this year is obviously going to be creative to 2025. Just wanted to clarify that point? Brian McDade : Yeah. I think that\u2019s a decent run rate for expectation relative to our development business, but a third probably stabilizes. Vince Tibone : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And if I can squeeze in one more follow up, can you just provide a quick description of any Mall redevelopment started in the quarter? I saw the spend increased some, but no description in the release of the project. Brian McDade : So we started a resi project at Briarwood, and we started a redevelopment at Tacoma. Those were the two big ones in the quarter that really, that we added to the pipeline. Vince Tibone : Great. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Good morning. Just given where we are with the election next week, just curious on your thoughts on potential positives or negatives that could come out, depending on which side wins. And I guess specifically also, what would be your view on tariffs? Is that positive or negative for Simon\u2019s business as a whole? Thank you. David Simon : Well, look, I am of the view that, we should -- we -- look, I\u2019m of the view that CEOs, whether they\u2019re founders, kind of like the way I feel or up through the ranks, ought to stay out of politics, okay? That\u2019s not to say that they shouldn\u2019t lobby, because there are a lot of things that go on in Washington that may affect the company and that\u2019s their job. So I\u2019m going -- and I\u2019m not here to endorse, kind of take the Washington Post view that, that we have to be ready for all sorts of outcomes. I do think because of that the vitriol that\u2019s occurring and that\u2019s why we\u2019re cautious with respect to kind of our guidance for the fourth quarter is that it\u2019s an uncertain time, right? So not only here domestically and here globally. But beyond that, I really am not going to get into that. I think the decision ought to be left to the -- to individuals. People like me should stay out of trying to influence the people, the people are what matter and we\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019ll be prepared, there\u2019s basically six potential outcomes, right, if I had to do it right. You could have a Democratic sweep, you could have a Republican sweep, and then you can, I used to be able to do that, but three times, I think it\u2019s six, right? So you could have six possible outcomes, we\u2019ve got to be ready for all six. And I\u2019m not going to tell you what outcome I want. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job. I do think it\u2019s my job to lobby once we understand, what\u2019s happening, like, maybe on the de minimis rule or et cetera, that hurts our retailers or hurts our consumer. But beyond that, if I could be so -- I don\u2019t know -- I want to -- I don\u2019t know if I should say this sounds, guys like me, who knows what guys like me means. But we ought to like, just let the people decide, without this overbearing influence from outside people, that that\u2019s my personal kind of view and we just need to be ready for six possible outcomes. Juan Sanabria : Fair enough. Understood. Thanks, David. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Maybe just tying some of the themes that we\u2019ve heard from the call together. Your occupancy crossed 96%, you feel like there\u2019s more room to grow, you\u2019re focused on merchandising and being selective and it also looks like you\u2019re expiring rates for 2026 maturities are below 2025 by 67%. So you\u2019ve been throwing it together, does that give you confidence or visibility to sustainable mid-single-digit NOI growth over the next couple of years? Brian McDade : Hey, Michael. It\u2019s Brian. Yes. We do believe that we will have the momentum in our NOI will continue. All of the things you highlighted are certainly part of it, plus the investment of capital back into the business. As you\u2019ve heard David say, we will be opening up projects in 2025, 2026 and 2027, but there\u2019s going to be no new supplies. So that is certainly going to support our growth as well. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide some color on the quarter-over-quarter improvement in Domestic and portfolio NOI? And then how do you think about NOI growth in 2025 as an initial guidepost? Brian McDade : Well, Linda, I think, the quarter we continue to see rent growth, occupancy growth, conversion of temp to perm. I think you see the quarter reflecting us executing on our business plan to a high degree. And as I just said, I think we carry that momentum into next year as we continue to execute. Linda Tsai : Any color on 2025, though, in terms of the same level continuing? Brian McDade : Well, Linda, we give our guidance in February, so we\u2019ll update you at that point in time, but I do believe that we have momentum. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Brian McDade : Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Muller with JPMorgan. Mike Muller : Yeah. Hi. Two questions. First, do you think you\u2019ll see more acquisition opportunities over the next few years compared to what you\u2019ve seen over the past five years or 10 years? And then the second question on development, redevelopment, what do you see as the average spend level for the next three years? David Simon : Yeah. I will answer and let Brian take number two, but I\u2019ll answer one. I do -- listen, I think, a company like ours has been always structured, built, financed to buy high quality retail real estate has obviously been our primary focus. So it\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019ll be similar to what we\u2019ve done the last five years or 10 years. But there will be opportunities for us to grow. We really haven\u2019t done much of any acquisitions since the TRG deal, which was, I can still remember that, it was in the height of, well, it was a week, two weeks before COVID. And then Bobby forgot to tell me, he should have known because, he has those assets to China, but he forgot to tell me about COVID. But it worked out for everybody involved. But so it\u2019s really been a while. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not looking, paying attention to it, but we\u2019re being very thoughtful about what we would like to buy and at what price. And I would tell you that\u2019s not going to change, but I do think there\u2019ll be opportunities as we go forward. But again, it\u2019s hard to compare it to five years or 10 years ago, but I do think over time we\u2019ll grow through acquisition. Go ahead on the pipe. Brian McDade : And Michael, I think, you think about the development and redevelopment pipeline. You heard David talk today about there\u2019s about a $4 billion shadow pipeline. We\u2019ve got a $1.2 billion committed. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see us committed for a $1.5 billion a year. That could ebb and flow by a couple hundred million on either side, just given the size of the projects and the delivery of the projects. So we do see that level of investment available to us over in the future. Mike Muller : Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Brian McDade : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Good morning. David Simon : Good morning. Ki Bin Kim : Just going back to ShopSimon.com, can you just provide some high level parameters on the progress you\u2019re making, the traction you\u2019re gaining and also curious about the backend logistics side of it. If you -- are -- given the multiple brands we have, are the shipments being consolidated or is it still each individual retailer sending shipments? David Simon : Yeah. Just -- I\u2019ll answer that first. I mean, look, we\u2019re early days in using ShopSimon for delivery. Remember, it\u2019s mostly a marketplace, but we think over time that\u2019ll be a service that we\u2019ll be able to offer through the ShopSimon app or website. And I would say we\u2019ve had remarkable growth in our GMV. We just rebranded it. So I\u2019m only hesitant because we do have a partner in that and I\u2019m not sure I should disclose that to you, but we\u2019ve got a meaningful growth in our GMV there. And now that we\u2019re going to use our brand and our, as Brian mentioned in his remarks, our 25 million email list and add loyalty, we think there\u2019ll be more retailers on which will add to GMV, which will add to the overall volume of the site So I\u2019m just going to be cautious, Ki Bin, because, we have a partner there. So the good news is we\u2019re making a lot of progress and we\u2019ve got real traction. We\u2019ve got a number of retailers. I don\u2019t remember exactly, but Brian or Tom can tell you after the call, but I\u2019ll hold off on the GMV right now, maybe at some point we\u2019ll be able to disclose that. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ron Kamdem : Hey. Just a quick one for me. Just looking at the sort of the Domestic NOI growth, almost 5%, which is pretty strong. In the past you\u2019d sort of made some comments about next year sort of hitting that 3% number. Just curious to get some update and comments on what you\u2019re seeing on the ground and any sort of differentiation between the traditional Mall and Outlet business, as well would be helpful? Thanks. David Simon : Yeah. Listen, I think, overall, they\u2019re all kind of moving in that direction. So I appreciate you trying to get us to disclose our 2025 comp NOI growth. We will do so in February. We\u2019re just going through the phase of that now, which is, as I mentioned to you, we did the Malls this week. We do the Outlets and The Mills next week. But we\u2019ll absolutely share that with you with our year-end earnings in early Feb and -- but again, I think, the momentum that we\u2019re seeing over the last couple of years continues. That\u2019s the important point. Ron Kamdem : Thanks so much. David Simon : Thank you. Brian McDade : Thanks, Ron. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the floor back over to David Simon for any closing comments. David Simon : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate all the questions and interest, and we\u2019ll talk soon if we don\u2019t talk of a good holiday season. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Thank you for your participation.",

For those of you who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I am pleased to introduce David Simon. David Simon : Good evening. I'm pleased with our financial and operational results in the fourth quarter, concluding an exceptional year for our company. We reported record total funds from operation of $4.9 billion or $12.99 per share. We generated $4.6 billion in real estate FFO or $12.24 per share, which was growth of 3.9% year-over-year. We returned a record of more than $3 billion to shareholders in cash dividends and now we have paid approximately $45 billion to shareholders in dividends over our history as a public company. We saw record leasing and retail sales volume and occupancy gains for the year. We completed last week the acquisition of the mall, two well-known luxury outlet centers in Italy from Kering. We look forward to adding these high-quality luxury assets into our global portfolio while continuing to build upon their success. We opened a new fully leased premium outlet in Tulsa, Oklahoma and we completed 16 significant redevelopment projects during the year. Development, redevelopment opportunities are growing within our portfolio. We delevered our A-rated balance sheet providing additional capacity and flexibility to fund future growth. I'm now going to turn it over to Brian, who will cover our fourth quarter results in more detail and provide our outlook for 2025. Brian McDade : Thank you, David. Real estate FFO was $3.35 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $3.23 in the prior year, 3.7% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.18 of growth. During the quarter, we sold assets that resulted in a tax benefit, which partially offset a prior tax expense from our ABG sale and essentially offset a write-off of pre-development costs associated with a joint venture development project in California. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,500 leases for 6.1 million square feet in the quarter. For the year, we signed a record 5,500 leases for more than 21 million square feet. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals. Malls and Outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 96.5%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Our year-end occupancy is the highest level over the last eight years. The Mills occupancy was 98.8%, an increase of 1% and is at a record level. Average base minimum rent for the Malls and Outlets increased 2.5% year-over-year and the Mills increased 4.3%. Retailer sales per square foot was $739 for the year. Strong revenue growth across our businesses, combined with expense discipline resulted in a 100 basis point increase year-over-year in our industry leading operating margin. Our occupancy cost at the end of the year was 13%. Domestic NOI increased 4.4% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.7% for the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at a constant currency grew 4.5% for the quarter and 4.6% for the year. Fourth quarter funds from operation were $1.39 billion or $3.68 per share compared to $1.38 billion or $3.69 per share last year. Fourth quarter results include $0.20 per share of non-cash after-tax gain from the combination of JCPenney and SPARC Group. The mark-to-market fair-value of Klepierre's exchangeable bonds increased year-over-year, which offset a lower contribution from OPI operations. As a reminder, the prior year results include $0.33 per share in gain from the sale of part of our interest in ABG last year. Turning to new development and redevelopment. This year, we will open our first premium outlets in Jakarta, Indonesia in March and expect to begin construction on four to five mixed use projects throughout the year. We expect to fund these redevelopments and mixed use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after our dividend payments. Other platform investments, JCPenney and SPARC Group combined to form a portfolio of iconic retailer banners called Catalyst brands. Catalyst brings together SPARC's brands, Aeropostale, Brooks Brothers, Eddie Bauer, Lucky and Nautica with JCPenney in its exclusive private brands. Catalyst sold Reebok in early January and is currently evaluating strategic options for Forever 21. We view the Catalyst transaction as a positive development that will create significant synergies with a solid balance sheet that will enable the company to drive EBITDA growth. Catalyst shareholders include Simon, Brookfield, Authentic Brands Groups and Shein. Turning to the balance sheet. During 2024, we completed $11 billion in financing activities, including issuing $1 billion in senior notes with a 10 year term and a 4.75% interest rate. We recasted our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with maturity extended to January of 2030 and no change in pricing or terms and completed over $6 billion of secured loan refinancing and extensions. Lastly, we delevered our balance sheet by approximately $1.5 billion in the year and ended the year at 5.2 times net debt to EBITDA. Our A-rated balance sheet provides a distinct advantage with more than $10 billion of liquidity at year-end. Additionally, today, relative to our dividend, we announced a dividend of $2.10 per share for the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7.7%. The dividend is payable on March 31st. Now moving on to our 2025 guidance. Our real estate FFO guidance range is $12.40 to $12.65 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions, domestic property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2024 of between $0.25 to $0.30 per share, reflecting current market interest rates and projected cash balances compared to 2024. Lastly, our diluted share count of approximately 377 million shares and units outstanding, due to the recent Catalyst brands transaction, we will not include Catalyst guidance at this time. We expect there will be significant savings and synergies from the combination that will be coupled with potential restructuring costs. We expect Catalyst will generate positive EBITDA in fiscal 2025 and roughly breakeven FFO as they work through the combination. With that, thank you. And David and I are now available for your questions. Operator : Great. Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. I know you'll get through some of the numbers through some of the other questions. I wanted to focus on some of the initiatives you have to bring people to the mall. I know you have the Tomorrow Stars, the Meet Me @themall when your traffic was up at malls, premium outlets. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the programs initiatives that you're doing to again bring the shopper to the mall and how did those programs go for the holiday season? Thank you. David Simon : Well, listen, I think we're leaders in this area. Our national advertising campaign is all about talking about how it's fun to go to the mall and hang out just like in the 80s and 90s we had a very good reception to it. We rebranded Simon Premium Outlets to ShopSimon. We're in the midst of creating our loyalty program. So and then obviously we've got events, thousands of events that drive traffic through the year, whether it's breast cancer awareness programs, Valentine's Day, basically every major event that occurs at within the US we try to drive an event around that Easter down the road. So I couldn't be prouder of our marketing efforts. They're very digital, they're very fun, they use new media in a lot of ways. And I just expect more and more. And more importantly, we're seeing return on investment. And we've got the data to prove that. And not that our peer group is wide and deep, but to the extent that it is, there's nobody doing more when it comes to data, digital comments, commerce with a ShopSimon, marketing, events you put it all together where leaps and bounds compared to what else is out there. Jeffrey Spector : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yes, thanks. Good evening. David, you guys obviously had a great year with 21 million square feet of leasing, occupancy up. Given where you're sitting on the occupancy side, I'm just curious how the discussions your leasing team are having with the retailers is kind of shifting and maybe talk about the pricing power and how that's kind of returned to the mall for the A's and I guess to tie that into NOI growth, you've talked about greater than 3%, but you certainly beaten 4% for the last like three years in a row. So what are we missing on the 3% front and maybe just comment on pricing power. Thank you. David Simon : Well, let me just talk about 3%. So look, as we did last year, we budget flat sales. Why? I don't really know, but that's what we do. And when you do that, we come up with a conservative number. To the extent that we have sales growth like we did this year, again, maybe not overall, but the retailers that matter, we generate overage rent, which obviously pops our NOI growth. So I hope we're being conservative. Obviously, there is pretty good animal spirits in the US and its economy. We expect it to participate in that. And again I don't like the word pricing power. I just think we're able to, we have deep relationships with our retailers and we're able to generate a lot of new business. We see new retailers approach us all the time and new uses all the time, which essentially allows us to and one of the big things to grow -- we're never stuck with the tenant mix that we have. So what and I think Brian knows the numbers specifically, but I think 25% of our leases this year were new. So what's driving a lot of what we do is we're able to take retailers that aren't doing the sales and replace them with ones that will. And that because they'll do better volume, that drives rent growth. And then I don't call that pricing power. I just think that's improving our mix and doing what we need to do to drive our business forward. And as I said, I think, last call is we still think we have an opportunity because frankly we've been organizationally very focused on for no better or the A's. We do think there is real effort focus growth for us in the B's where we're investing our dollars. So that's a big program for us in '25 and '26. And just to cap off your question, we still feel, and again, it's hard to predict because there's always downtime, tenant bankruptcies, et cetera. But we still feel like we have upside in our occupancy. We're still not at our high that was 97.1%, if I remember right in 2014, Tom's shaking his head, yes. So we still some message to my leasing team, if they're listening. I don't mind if they're not, if they're making a lease, but assuming they're listening. Let's get up to a record high in 2014 and then we'll take a deep breath, but we won't tell that. Operator : Next question is from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Maybe just following off the last one, right, the NOI expectation dropped from 4% last year and for the last several years is down to 3%. So bridging the gap between those expectations, right, it sounds like some of that is retail sales, but it sounds like occupancy, there is still upside, but is there the same magnitude of upside? And then also are you taking into account any sort of tenant bankruptcies or credit reserve in that as well, which is driving that by 100 basis points? Thanks. Brian McDade : Hey, Michael, it's Brian. So I think first, we've historically put out at least 3% at the beginning of every year, including last year and then have subsequently beat that, which we've repeated here. I think you just heard David talk about the overage component, we budgeted , assume sales were flat, so there is a negative componentry mathematically to overage in the subsequent year. You heard us just talk about mix. And so as we swap out tenants for new tenants, there is downtime specifically associated with our full price business as we build out those stores. Last thing I would mention, you just mentioned bad debt. Our numbers in '25 take into consideration our historical approach to bad debt. We did slightly better than that in 2024, but we've taken an appropriate expectation into '25 relative to our standard approach. So those are the three major drivers that would get you kind of back to a, from this year's number down to a 3% number for, again, as a baseline starting in '25. Michael Goldsmith : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from Craig Mailman from Citi. Please go ahead. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, just want to touch on the potential impact for tariffs. Obviously, the news keeps changing. But just broadly what are you hearing from your retailers? How is it impacting their business and kind of the uncertainty there and the potential impact of the de-minimis exemption going away? David Simon : Yeah, first, I don't -- it's interesting just our first hand -- I don't know where every retailer sources their goods. But if you take Catalyst as an example, they only source 20% of their goods with all the brands of about 20 -- in China, okay. So and we talk to Catalysts their view of it is with respect to China that they'll pass some of it on to the consumer, but also hope that the supplier tightens up the cost of goods sold. So many, many retailers have moved a lot of production out of China over the last several years. And the good news is where we had kind of the most exposure was shoes, which Reebok would have been more exposed. But as you know, we disposed of the Reebok operating business in January. So no one is really, honestly, it hasn't affected by our day-to-day decision making and it's relatively reduced amount for the retailers. What's really going to be helpful to the American retailers and the non-Chinese retailers is to get rid of the de-minimis rule, which basically exempts tariffs if you send a package over $800 to a customer, that's not a level playing field. That causes retailers to pay more that ship in bulk and it's given real benefits to someone like the [indiscernible] where they've shipped purposely under the $800. But Congress is taking it up. I know the President is taking it up and that will absolutely be if enacted will give a real shot in the arm to retailers that don't purposely, don't purposely try to send their goods to get under the $800 limitation, not only to say it's also more green, it saves packaging costs, et cetera. It's good for our country and I hope Congress and/or the President enact it. That to me is more material than any tariffs that are being talked about. Nicholas Joseph : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Please go ahead. Floris van Dijkum : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Good to hear your voice, David. A couple of questions, but I guess I'm going to focus on your latest acquisition in Italy. I note that Kering just snuck into your top 10 list this past quarter prior to the acquisition. I'm curious if you can talk about that acquisition, the returns that you expect to achieve and how you might be able to manage those assets going forward? And also what would Kering's percentage have been? Had they been included? I guess I know that your top 10 is domestic only, but how much of an impact would that have on the, if you were to include Kering's exposure in Europe as well? David Simon : Well, on that particular point, you'll see that in our next supplement. So it will go up, but you'll see that in our next supplement. Look, I would say, we're under confidentiality agreement on the details other than the price. I will tell you we've been very, as you know, very selective on the acquisitions and we're only buying top stuff at the right price. This follows 100% of that strategy. So it's top stuff at the right price. Kering will remain a long-term tenant in that. They have a very -- they've had historically a very competent group that ran it for them, obviously because they're not that's not their main business as you know. We've taken over that team, we'll help them with strategic guidance and we think there's upside in the business. We think it's NAV accretive for us. We also think it's earnings accretive for us. So it again is a something we wanted to do years and years ago, but they weren't ready to do it. We're extremely excited about doing it, the location, Italy's, in a renaissance so it's got one of the positive growth in the EU. And this is these are the kind of deals we want to do buy it at the right price, it's accretive to NAV, accretive to earnings, but it's also high quality with the right retailers. And we couldn't have done a -- we couldn't have picked a better asset in terms of this. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks, David. David Simon : Thank you, Floris. Operator : Next question is from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good evening. David, following up on your comment regarding the focus on B Mall investments in 2025, '26, are you able to talk about the types of investments that you make in those malls, whether it differs from how you would approach investing in an A Mall? And then any detail on the magnitude of those investments and expected return? Thanks. David Simon : I'll just be very generic Brian can lay it out for you later. But to me it's a whole combination of things. These are important assets in the communities. We've been focused on the bigger assets historically. So it's a combination of adding boxes, updating the look, feel of the place, restaurants, tenants, everyone changes a little bit differently. But I'll just take Smith Haven as an example. We're going to -- I got to be careful because I don't know if I can announce it even though the lease is signed. So I think an announcement is coming. The business in basically Eastern Long Island where we're going to update, renovate the property, add a great retailer in a huge box. We just added Primark. Hospital just opened up their one of their health facilities and that will probably be about a 12% return and over the next couple of years and it will be a renovated, rejuvenated asset that because of all the progress we've made in the bigger ones, we're able to kind of reenergize our focus on an asset like that. But there the list of those is long. So Brian can go through it, but that's just one kind of jumps to top of mind and to my team I'm supposed to see a press release on that, but I haven't seen it so please move that along. Greg McGinniss : Thank you. Operator : I'm sorry. Next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good evening, David. Good to hear you. And I'm sure the people out of Smithtown will appreciate the dollar spend. A question on your guidance for '25. Obviously, very good versus expectations despite the headwinds on the interest expense that Brian laid out. So my question is, is this back to sort of the old Simon days pre-pandemic where you guys just had strong internal growth that was accelerating or is this more about removing OPI drag from the future? I'm just trying to understand if this is just all the side, but not yet leases taking effect or if truly the underlying portfolio is accelerating and we're going back to where you guys used to be pre-pandemic when the core portfolio would just -- was really just humming along? David Simon : Well, the $12.40 to $12.65 excludes Catalyst. The other investments in OPI are small. So they're -- and again they're neither FFO is probably the wrong way to look at those investments, but they run through FFO anyway because they're one's an asset management company and one's an e-commerce marketplace and an e-commerce retailer. And so FFO is the least important metric on those, but they run through our numbers. So Catalyst is outside of that number. And I don't like the word old, Alex. But, yes, no, we're growing the portfolio. We said at least 3%, I think, we've said at least 3% last two years, maybe three, I don't remember three years, Brian saying. So hopefully, we can beat that and that's basically all the stuff that leads to that, which is leasing, focused operational margins, events, Simon Brand Ventures replacing boxes, restaurants, all of the basics and we still see that. I think we've had a pretty good run, forget the big juice that we got back from, getting back to business after we were unreasonably shut down by various state governments, but we've been clipping along 4% plus even though we guided to 3% and let's see how this year transpires, but we've got a lot going for us. And the biggest of which is great team, leasings focused. We feel that there's upside in the portfolio across the board, but primarily in our historical bread and butter properties. We're going to do smart deals. We're prudent with a hell of a balance sheet and I think and we're lease, lease, lease. I think it's not overly complicated. And then Catalyst well it's obviously a big six months as they go through it and we'll have a better sense of kind of it will be positive EBITDA for sure, we'll have better idea of FFO as the year progresses. But just to be clear, it's not in our number as of what we've guided to in the $12.40 to $12.65. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Good to see the magic. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Great to hear your voice, David, as well. Just a question on the leasing. It looks like about 5% is still month-to month. I think that's still kind of above where you were pre-COVID in 2019. So just curious on how you think that will evolve over time and is just like a second or part B of a question. How has the SNO pipeline changed if at all over time? And could you just give us where it is as of year-end please? Brian McDade : Hey, Juan, it's Brian. SNO at the year-end was about 250 basis points as we brought occupancy on in the fourth quarter and you saw that in the numbers. Month-to-month will as we move leases through our leasing process, ultimately, not everything gets signed at the same time. So we put that into that category. Nothing there. We're in the process of renewals in year-end leasing. And so ultimately we would expect that number to come down throughout the year. David Simon : I just would say we're slightly for the life of me, I don't understand why it takes so long. But put that aside, we do get our leases signed up and we are slightly ahead of where we were last year on our renewals. Inside, I should say, but we've got commitment on a lot of sure. Operator : Next question is from Vince Tibone from Green Street. Please go ahead. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good evening. I have a few questions related to the mixed use projects you mentioned earlier. So what is the expected pro-rata spend on the four to five mixed use projects to break ground in '25? And also like what's the common structure? Are you doing this primarily on your own balance sheet or using joint venture partners the non-retail components? And then also is it mostly residential or like where are some of the other non-retail property types in there? Sorry for couple of questions. David Simon : Yes. I'm sorry, I interrupted you. So it will be around $400 million to $500 million. And again we are -- when I look at the ones that we're expecting to start this year, they're all JVs and they will run from residential to a couple of hotels to office. And just to give you a sense what's in that category. We expect to start a hotel in Roosevelt Field. A big residential project in Brea, office at Clearfork and we're expanding a hotel at The Domain in Austin, Texas. Those are all pretty much planned for. I would expect this to add to that this year. As you know we've got Northgate under construction. We are going to somewhat accelerate if we can anything we're planning in California. I am very nervous about construction costs there given the horrific events in Southern Cal. So we're looking at a couple of projects there that we might push before, before what's going on there, but I would expect us to add more to the pipeline, but those are kind of the ones that were pretty much, so got shovel on the ground and went over, but those are all pretty much baked in the cake. And in this case, they all happen to be JVs, but that could change. Vince Tibone : No, that's really helpful. If I can maybe squee in one more clarification. When you say joint ventures like is Simon typically like a 10% or 20% partner in the non-retail portion or are you an 80% owner of the non-retail? Just trying to get a sense of appetite for non-retail? David Simon : Yes. That's usually 50-50. Vince Tibone : Yes. Great. Thank you. David Simon : Okay. No problem. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yes, hi. I know you can't talk about the carrying pricing, but what's your sense as to how pricing on a comparable quality US assets would compare today. Do you think it would be similar stronger or weaker? David Simon : I missed the question. So can you say one more? I didn't understand. Can you reframe? Mike Mueller : Yes. So, yes, I was saying on the Italy purchase, we know you can't talk about the cap rate and the economics. But just curious as a hypothetical, if you have something comparable quality in the US, how would you imagine the pricing would compare to what you were in for in Italy? Do you think it would be stronger, higher cap rate, lower cap rate, something similar? Just curious of the thoughts there. David Simon : It's a good question and I'm trying to think if I can answer it. I'll try to be artful. I would say let me do a macro, a macro make a macro statement about is what usually macro or the even though properties are powerful and comparable. They'll tend to have higher cap rates than they would to the US and obviously that calculus is important as to how we think about things. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. David Simon : How was that? Mike Mueller : That was good. I think you pointed in the direction. There you go. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Caitlin Burrows : Hi, everyone. Maybe just another question on kind of acquisitions or capital allocation generally, but it sounds like you were targeting the Kering acquisition for a while and I imagine there are many other deals that you've assessed over the past couple of years. So I was wondering if you could talk about the rest of the acquisition properties that might be out there that could be attractive to you and how you're balancing perhaps buying those versus your stock versus more redevelopment versus increasing the dividend, realizing that you're kind of doing a little bit of all of that. David Simon : Yes, listen, I would say, Caitlin that we're not, there's no big deal that is on the drawing board. So we're still interested in few high-quality transactions, we're working on them. There's no guarantee. But I think since there's no big deal, we're going to do it all and that's kind of my philosophy right now. So we may if there were a big deal to do, you can define big deal, but several billion dollars, billions of dollars, let's say, not then we might have to readjust our thinking, but I think we're going to, the mindset right now is we can do it all. Remember, we delevered, and so we're still working on a couple of high-quality transactions, but they're not like they're not going to tip the scales from a leverage or financial consequence or capacity point of view. And as you know, development, redevelopment is a three-year product, just you build a house, you buy a house, it's one thing you need to build it, you got three years to stroke the check every year. So for so or every month and unless you have a really nice contractor. So honestly, I think, we're going to do it all, redevelop. We don't mind buying our stock back. And obviously subject to market conditions, we have the capacity to do so. And then I think redevelopment, development, we announced Nashville. We're really excited about that land. It's in the growth corridor, it's on the interstate. Great, great ingress, egress, visibility, terrific long-term 100 acre site. So we got stuff going on in Asia on development. Nothing really on new development in Europe. So just maybe a couple of things here and there, but we're also looking expanding some of our better assets like a Woodbury or a Toronto Premium Outlet or Desert Hills et cetera. So that stuff is high priority. So right now obviously things change. But right now we're planning to keep operating the same way we're operating. A little bit of everything. Caitlin Burrows : Sounds like a lot of opportunity. Great. Thanks. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, there, good evening. Thanks for taking my question and good to hear you, David. My question, I guess, I wanted to go back a bit more to your plan on investing a bit more on your B assets here. I guess I'm curious how you're able to generate the 12% returns versus, I think the 8% to 9% we've seen in more of your A projects here the last couple of years? Is it the lower rent basis? Are you seeing, I guess, stronger any sense of stronger demand for space in any of those B Malls? And is 12% more of an anomaly or more than norm for these B Mall investments you're making? Thanks. David Simon : Yes, I think the simple thing is right now we have little to no income. But when we always give you a number on return, we're always backing out existing income. But in this case, if you have an empty box or empty space, there's no existing income and that really drives kind of the incremental return. That's the biggest element of it. And they're not all, the 12%, I kind of referred to what we see as Smith Haven, but they're not all that way. But in a lot of cases, it's just empty space or an empty box. And it's income, basically, there's no offset against it because there is no existing retailer or and then it's just the capital we have to put in to do it. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. I appreciate that. And just thinking about that 12%, is that kind of reflective of the incremental risk return or risk premium perhaps for some of these assets? Just curious how that perhaps would? David Simon : I think that's a good point, but I would re-characterize it. So let's say there's a, and again, our B Malls are probably some equals better than A Malls. But let's just take a B Mall and where we think the value very simplistically is an eight cap rate, okay? We wouldn't want to invest in that asset at a six return because that would be diluted NAV. So part of what you're going to see and are seeing is we really look to improve that kind of portfolio was if we can't make NAV accretive investments, we won't do it. So we're better off in that case, just managing the cash flow to the best of our abilities. So I understand your point, I kind of re-characterized it not because of risk, it's not really risk adjusted, it's more what's the value of the asset and will this add to the value of that asset. Follow what I'm saying? Haendel St. Juste: Absolutely. And that's partly what I was getting at. So I appreciate that. Thank you. David Simon : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Yes, hi. Regarding the comment that you buy only really good stuff after Kering, do you see more opportunities abroad or domestically? David Simon : I would say mostly domestic, just because it's got to be really unique, which is what we saw the mall, which is rare. And again, as I mentioned earlier, I think I talked to them, hard to remember, but it was definitely a couple of years pre-COVID. So I just think there is very few jewels like that in Europe that make sense with what we do in Europe, if you understand what I'm saying. So we're not going to buy a mall in Europe, just to have one mall in Europe. So the outlet business, we view it a little differently. So I would say by, because of that, it's going to be really unique and more the domestic, let's say more domestic. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then how are you feeling about the consumer right now and high versus low end US versus Europe? David Simon : Well, I think they're very cautious in Europe. And the US consumer is still I'm still nervous about the lower end consumer. The better to the upper income, I feel pretty confident about that. A lot of whipsaws going on left and right, so it's very hard to predict, but generally still concerned about the lower end pretty bullish on the upper to high end consumer. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go-ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Hey, if we could just go back to sort of the strong performance last year. Wondering if we could dig in a little bit between sort of the outlets and the mall business, any sort of call out what drove the performance? Is it traffic? Is it higher ticket prices so on and so forth? And the second part of the question is really, are you seeing any impact from the strong dollar on tourist centers? Thanks. Brian McDade : So, Ron, it's Brian. There wasn't a big bifurcation kind of between asset classes. I think all three platforms performed exceedingly well. You did see the outlet in the mills, which generally skew a little bit more value oriented to outperform a little bit into the fourth quarter. It wasn't really kind of an anomaly just kind of expected performance. I mean, we've not seen any real time impact yet to the tourist oriented centers, but we're February 4th. So still early in the year, but we would expect to see or if we continue to see dollar strength, can see some impact over the course of the year, certainly in our translations of our foreign earnings. Ronald Kamdem : Thanks so much. David Simon : And I would just say when we talk about reenergizing on the assets. Don't just think malls, think outlets, think a few of our mills. So it's a wide portfolio focus, not just when people talk B, they always think malls, but for us it's across our entire domestic portfolio. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thank you. David Simon : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to David Simon for any closing comments. David Simon : Okay. Thank you, everybody and look forward to talking in the future. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",
