Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carl Haney, Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, Corporate Product Innovation and Packaging Development. Carl will give a strategic overview of our innovation program. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to state that the fiscal 2014 is off to a strong start, as our strategy continues to fuel progress in many areas. During our first quarter, we had good global success from innovations, gained meaningful market share in Asia, China and the U.K. and continued to attract new consumers to our brands. Our sales rose 6% in local currency, in line with our guidance. Importantly, our growth came from every major category in every region, illustrating, once again, broad-based success, thanks to our diverse portfolio of brands and unparalleled High-Touch service. Diluted earnings per share were $0.76, which was better than we had anticipated. Continuing a trend we have seen in recent quarters, our biggest winners were our luxury brands, as well as M-A-C, which were all up double digits. China and other emerging markets advanced sharply, as did our online and travel retail channels. Our fragrance business was also an important contributor to sales growth, thanks to increased launch activity, excellent innovation and robust sales in the ultra-prestige tier . As we anticipated, U.S. prestige beauty was somewhat soft, driven by low traffic in stores in July and August, but it improved in September. Overall, prestige growth in the quarter was just about half the pace of a year ago and the environment was more promotional. Many consumers sought value at both prestige beauty products that were either advertised innovations or promotions. In this environment, our brand focused on driving innovation and did not increase their promotions. In the U.S., we started gaining share in fragrance for the first time in several years. Also, 5 of our brands, mainly in luxury, increased their share of prestige beauty. Our products held 9 of the top 10 SKUs in prestige skin care and 8 of the top 10 in makeup. Our performance in Europe, the Middle East & Africa was encouraging, led by continued strong results in the U.K. and healthy retail sales in emerging markets. Some Western European markets remained challenging for prestige beauty, but in several of them, we outperformed the general trend. In France, for instance, prestige beauty struggled, but many of our brands resonated well with consumers, which fueled good retail sales. The same was true in Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries. Asia Pacific was our strongest region, led by sharp gains in Greater China. Retail growth in China was also strong and like door growth improved over the preceding quarter. Results in Japan, again, were positive, posting local currency growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. And Australia showed signs of a turnaround as we generated mid-single-digit retail sales growth. Our business in Korea is stabilizing, but the difficult prestige beauty environment continued and our sales there declined moderately. Driving our growth is a well-defined focus on product to service innovations as Carl would soon elaborate. As a global company, we are innovating for a diverse world, and 2 of our biggest launches in the quarter came from our 2 biggest brands. The cutting-edge technologies used in Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum helped to drive growth in the brands and our franchise in each skin care category. Retail sales of ANR products climbed sharply in Asia and North America during the quarter. Clinique's new blockbuster, Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ met our expectation and had widespread acceptance globally, thanks to its enhanced technology and increased moisturizing benefits. For example, in the U.K., where Clinique is the #1 prestige beauty brand, sales of DDML+ rose strong double digits at retail during the quarter. While these 2 products are among our most publicized and visible launches, our innovation spans our complete portfolio. Even though we are focused on creating more impactful innovations, all brands launched innovation that are meaningful relatives for their size. Innovation is integral to reenergizing our fragrance category to drive profitable growth, so we recently introduced several important new scents. Est\u00e9e Lauder rolled out Modern Muse to select countries in September, making its first new major fragrance in a decade. It quickly became a bestseller in Harrods in the U.K. and reached the top 10 in the U.S. for women prestige fragrances in September, its first month at counter, and has continued to climb since then. We have high expectations for this exciting fragrance during the holiday season. Other successful fragrance launched include Michael Kors Collection, which helped drive our strong fragrance retail sales in North America. Additionally, Tory Burch launched, exclusively, in Bloomingdale's in the last week of September and has held the #1 spot in the retailer since then. Another newcomer, Zegna Uomo was well received and has been the top seller in booths in the U.K. since its launch 2 months ago. In our ultra-prestige tier, Tom Ford fragrances have seen significant growth around the world and Jo Malone's new scent Peony & Blush Suede has been the brand's best-selling innovation ever. Many of our fragrances have been backed by strong advertising campaigns to build awareness leading up to their peak selling period. Our business models for fragrance launches seeks to improve the success rate by introducing them, selectively, in certain markets and, often, after testing the waters. For instance, based on Michael Kors strong results in the United States in the first quarter, we plan to expand the new collection to Europe. Our sales growth also stems from high-growth channels, which continue to advance rapidly. In e-commerce, for example, both brands and retailer sites had substantial gains, resulting in excellent double-digit sales growth. In the U.S., an increasing amount of our sales in prestige department stores are coming from their e-commerce sites, and that channel is also a key component of the retailer's growth. Consumers in China are also migrating to shopping online, much faster than we anticipated. Even though e-commerce is a small percentage of our business in China, our online sales more than doubled from a year ago. Turning to our travel retail business, our retail sales growth was more than twice the rate of passenger traffic growth. We saw a significant spike in Asia, most notably in Thailand, Japan and China, due in part to an increase in Chinese travelers. Our recent skin care innovations are selling well and our travel retail business should benefit from the addition of the new fragrances. As part of the ongoing efforts to expand our brand presence in this profitable channel, we opened 27 doors in the recent period. We also invested in expanding our global network of freestanding stores, having opened approximately 20 new ones this quarter, nearly all in international markets. Sales in our retail locations climbed double digits, with the strongest growth coming from international stores. In particular, M-A-C flagships in New York and Paris generated high average unit sales and items per transaction than other M-A-C freestanding stores in the U.S. or France. In emerging markets, our expansion continued into smaller cities, which are providing the fastest growth. For instance, in China, we entered 5 new Tier 3 and 4 cities, and this strategy, also, is being successful in other countries like Brazil. To support our growth, we increased our advertising merchandising assembly in the first quarter, using a mix of in-store, print, TV and digital, depending on what was appropriate for the product and the country. Importantly, we continue to invest in many capabilities to sustain our growth, including innovation and retail store operations and our SMI adoption continues to progress smoothly. As we have said before, our main priority is to drive our top line and leverage that growth for continued margin expansion. Heading into the holidays, we are happy about our product offering and believe our retails sales growth will accelerate for several reasons. First, our major innovations are succeeding globally and the marketing investment that we made in the first quarter and will continue to make should propel their momentum. Moreover, we have many other innovations on the horizon, across all our product categories that we expect to contribute to higher sales. Additionally, we are much better positioned to have a stronger performance in fragrance this year, thanks to our new launches and believe we will be able to gain share. Our brands' wide collection of desirable fragrances cover a broad range of tastes and price points and should generate higher sales during the second quarter and beyond. Lastly, as the year goes on, the markets that have been challenging, including Korea, are facing easier comparisons. We continue to believe that global prestige beauty will grow 3% to 4% in fiscal year 2014. And our intent is to expand twice as fast. We are forecasting top line growth of 6% to 8% in local currency, even as we navigate several soft markets. We are confident we can achieve this ambition goal because more than 1/3 of our business is growing by double digits and the rest can keep pace with prestige beauty, confirming the resilience of our multi-brand and multichannel strategy. I want to thank everyone in our organization for their hard work and dedication, which has enabled us to start the year well. As we continue on our strategic journey, we carefully consider what paths to take. We are selective and pursue only the right opportunities, those we consider the most promising, that will enhance our leadership in global prestige beauty. Our creativity and imagination will lead with strong innovation will be key to our success in fiscal year '14. And now, I'll hand over to Carl to give you more details of our innovation process and plans. Carl? Carl Haney : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased join you today to share a few words on the research development, product and package innovation that is the backbone of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. I joined the company nearly 2 years ago, following more than 25 years with Procter & Gamble, with previous responsibilities including male grooming, cosmetics and beauty care. Our R&D and innovation organization is composed of hundreds of industry-leading scientists, engineers and managers, working in 5 major research centers around 3 continents. These talented innovators partner with our brand and product development leaders to fuel our innovation pipeline to deliver short and long-term results, directly linked to our companies strategy and 10-year compass. We have a diverse and talented team with deep expertise focused solely on prestige beauty. Over the past few years, we've been reinforcing our upstream capabilities globally and have recently doubled our investment in Asia. Our innovation centers have been designed to be close to the most demanding consumers we serve and are structured to drive local relevance for a diverse, multi-ethnic world. Our goal is to foster innovation in these centers to develop products for the largest and fastest growing categories and segments. We research, design and test where our consumers live and shop, giving us insight into their behaviors and desires. For instance, our R&D center in Shanghai taps into the personal customs and skin care requirements of the fast-growing Chinese market and provides valuable local insights. Local relevance is something you can expect to see even more of going forward. Creativity and innovation is part of our DNA and drives everything we do. We complement our internal capability with a long-standing and growing network of external innovation partners. These include world-class labs, universities, suppliers and cutting-edge technology research centers. We also leverage creativity and innovation from every chair, tapping into the latest trends and consumer insights from thousands of professional makeup artists, hairstylists and beauty advisers, globally. We are collaborating deeply with film, fashion and pop culture to develop innovative trends. Our product development, creative and brand leaders directly collaborate with top designers, celebrities, artists and experts to co-create inspiring innovations, such as M-A-C's Rihanna collections and Tory Burch's new fragrance. Together, we find ways to translate unique and creative points of view into beautiful products that our consumers love. As a creativity-driven, consumer-inspired organization, one of our greatest strengths is our ability to give consumers around the world the products and services they crave, or will crave, even before they want or need them. We define innovation broadly at Est\u00e9e Lauder. We seek to innovate across many dimensions from idea-led product innovations and brand-led storytelling to service innovations. We design, plan and track innovation, by brand, by product category, by year, by region and by type of innovation, to ensure near-term and long-term sufficiency. Our strategy, in recent years, has been to focus on bigger and broader launches. In fiscal 2013, innovation and new products across all brands and regions grew to 16% of our sales. We've also made significant progress in developing bigger initiatives with increasing local relevance whilst maintaining productivity. Let me take you briefly to our 5 types of innovations. Hero products are the pillars of our brands that provide truly transformational results. They delight existing consumers as well as attract new users. As Fabrizio mentioned before, these include products with new technology such as Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair Serum with patented Chronolux Technology and Clinique's new Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+, with improved clinical efficacy. They also include launching entirely new products, like Clinique's Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector, which introduced a new breakthrough technology to the market, creating a new segment in Skin Care. These patented and proprietary skin care technologies and ingredients were developed with our basic science research and skin care labs in Melville, New York. We also designed new hero products to be incremental to the brand, with new forms and textures, or adding incremental categories. Additional examples of this are La Mer's Moisturizing Soft Cream that brought a new generation of consumers to the franchise and our new La Mer Treatment Lotion with a Revitalizing Ferment in a watery essence, which is the preferred form in Asia and was developed, in partnership with our skin labs in Melville and Shanghai. Finally, we also create hero products inspired for regions, like Est\u00e9e Lauder successful Revitalizing Supreme Global Anti-Aging Creme. This patented multi-benefit product and texture was developed for and tested extensively on European women by our European team based in Paris. Having been broadly accepted in Europe, we're now launching it in North America this January. Sustaining innovations are upgrades and extensions to our core franchises and segments. They are a way to reengage consumers and extend our franchises to new categories and new users. A good illustration is how we are continuing to build out Clinique's groundbreaking Even Better franchise. Taking selective ingredients of the original Dark Spot Correcting Formula, we've extended the franchise to encompass a full collection, consisting of an eye cream, hand cream, facial moisturizer and foundation. Most recently, we created Even Better Essence Lotion, with a unique blend of ingredients and sensorial texture of a watery lotion geared towards Asian consumers. Surprising new trend innovations allow us to respond to emerging trends in ways that engage and delight consumers, as well as driving in-store traffic. These innovations create news, excitement and interest like M-A-C's over 40 collections and collaborations a year, that leverage our Color Innovation Center in Toronto, with expertise in optics, polymers and pigments. For example, the RiRi Hearts MAC campaign, co-designed with global pop superstar, Rihanna, drew 18 million visitors in 1 day, during the exclusive online launch of RiRi Woo lipstick, a key part of this collaboration. Launch and leverage innovations allow us to make our major launches even bigger over time. These include developing idea-led storytelling, leveraging claims on existing products, creating new regimens and expanding to new geographies. Launch and leverage also allows us to efficiently bring news to our hero products by exploiting our rich portfolio of existing and dormant assets such as claims and clinical studies. We leverage these assets with consumer relevant stories, cutting-edge insights and imagination to efficiently fuel our initiatives. Service innovations are designed to create High-Touch services that enhance the shopping experience and are tailored for locally relevant needs. Bespoke gifting at Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown's Pretty Powerful makeup lessons and Origins Sampling Bar are all examples of service innovations. We expect our innovation to be fully sufficient across our key metrics and I am personally very excited by the depth, breadth and balance of the pipeline of new technologies, formulations and products we plan to launch in fiscal 2014 and over the next few years. I would like to close by thanking all the innovators across our brands, regions and functions worldwide, as well as our partners who are creating these exciting product and service innovations that will continue to fuel our growth. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis : Thank you, Carl, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal 2014 first quarter results and then cover our expectations for the remainder of the year. My commentary on the financial results excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. As Fabrizio mentioned earlier, our sales for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. Net sales rose 5% to $2.68 billion. Excluding the impact of currency translations, sales grew 6%. Net earnings and earnings per share each decreased 3% to $301.6 million and $0.76, respectively. EPS was above the top end of our expectations, reflecting more favorable exchange rates and more disciplined management of cost. Every region contributed to sales growth in the quarter. Sales in our Americas region increased 2%, in local currency, with low-single-digit growth in North America and strong double-digit growth in Latin America. The strongest performance in North America came from double-digit sales growth through online, as well as high-single digit increases at specialty multi-brand stores and our freestanding stores. Mid-tier department stores were challenged, but their online businesses grew strongly. In the Europe, Middle East & Africa region, sales increased 7%, in local currency. We achieved double-digit sales gains in the U.K., Turkey and Switzerland, and our sales in the Travel Retail channel rose 9%. Among the more established markets in Western Europe, Germany and France rose mid- to high-single digits, while Liberia and Italy were essentially flat. Our sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 11%, in local currency. Our business in virtually all markets grew, and we saw a particularly strong double-digit growth from Greater China. Distribution expansion continues in China, where we added 30 new doors in 5 new cities during the quarter. Retail sales growth remains strong at approximately 16% and like door growth was mid-single digit. Thailand, Japan and Australia were also contributors to growth, while Korea remains challenging, as sales there declined 5%. Our gross margin increased 80 basis points to 79.7%, which largely reflected the impact of both positive mix and pricing. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, grew 280 basis points to 62.8%. Advertising and marketing investment, primarily drove the increase, reflecting the planned support of major product launches. Operating income fell 7% to $450.7 million and operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 16.9%. Net interest expense declined 15% to $13.5 million, primarily due to lower rates, and our effective tax rate was 30.8%. During the quarter, we generated a $155 million improvement in cash flow from operating activities, primarily through improved working capital in receivables and payables. Inventory days to sell rose to 195 compared with 177 days last year. The higher inventory was due, in part, to the size of our new product launches, as well as an increase in safety stock to meet customer demand. We expect to reduce this inventory level throughout the second and third quarters, and we are working on finalizing a long-term plan to address further improvements in working capital. We invested $86 million in capital projects to support new counters, technology and retail stores. We repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares of our stock for $59 million and used $70 million for dividends to stockholders. And we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. With the first quarter behind us, let's now turn to our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal year. As we outlined last quarter, for the full fiscal year, we plan to grow at approximately double the rate of global prestige beauty, which is expected to rise between 3% and 4% this year. Our main growth drivers continue to be enhanced global and local innovations, some of which you heard from Carl this morning; accelerating growth of our small and medium-sized brands; expansion and growth in developing markets; and continued focus on skin care and makeup with a greater contribution from fragrance as we renew our commitment to the category. Sales for fiscal 2014 are still expected to grow 6% to 8%, in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 1% to 2%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of 1.33 for the euro, 1.58 for the pound and 100 for the yen. The combined benefits of gross margin expansion and operating leverage are expected to drive operating margin expansion by 40 to 50 basis points for the full year. Continued cost discipline allows us to invest for sustained growth and efficiency. This year, we plan to further strengthen our capabilities and consumer and shopper insights, innovation, retail stores, supply chain, human resources and information systems. We expect advertising, merchandising and sampling to remain fairly consistent, as a percent of sales, for the year, but we have flexibility to invest incrementally behind activities that demonstrate good momentum. We will invest more heavily in the first half since supporting both major skin care fragrance launch -- franchise launches at the beginning of the year, as well as new fragrance launches which distort more at holiday. Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is planned at 30% to 32%. With a good start to the year, we are comfortable raising the low end of our guidance for full year EPS to a range of $2.80 to $2.87, which effectively increases the midpoint of our expectations range. Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movements, the approximately 1% to 2% negative currency impact on our top line equates to about $0.07 of EPS. As a reminder, the next wave of our SMI rollout is scheduled for July of 2014 and will include our North America Order to Cash process, our Travel Retail division, Japan and the Middle East markets, and represents approximately 18% of our sales. As has been the case in previous rollouts, we expect retailers will increase their orders in advance of the go live to mitigate any potential disruptions from the transition. The impact of this potential shift in orders will be to increase sales in our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year. We plan to provide an estimate of the shift as we get closer to the date and have a better indication of the needs of our retailers. The guidance we are giving today does not include any shift in these incremental sales and profits in fiscal 2014. Regarding the second quarter. Our sales are expected to grow 3% to 5% in local currency. Translation could contract growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The support of major product launches, particularly in fragrance, should drive higher sales growth, as well as higher marketing investments. We anticipate that EPS will come in between $0.99 and $1.04. There are a few items impacting comparability to the prior year quarter that you should keep in mind. You will recall that we also had an SMI shift last year and that some of our customers increased orders ahead of the SMI rollout last January. That resulted in a shift in sales from our third quarter to the second quarter of last year of $94 million or $78 million in operating income and $0.13 in EPS. Adjusting for this shift, our sales growth is expected to be between 6% to 8%, in local currency, for the quarter. Last December, we recorded $21.3 million in other income related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields. This added approximately $0.04 to EPS in last year's second quarter. And lastly, I want to remind you that the holiday selling period is shortened this year due to the late Thanksgiving. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Can you just talk about -- it's not just an Est\u00e9e thing, it seems like, but if you look some of the NPD data, some of the mainstream brands, which obviously includes Est\u00e9e and Clinique, seem like they have slowed recently. And so, why do you think that's happening? Is there anything you can do to sort of accelerate your relative growth in that respect? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. In NPD, first of all, Bill, one clarification. NPD North America covers about 60% of our business. There is all the freestanding stores, the online, some specialty there, outside of this or this. Anyway, in NPD, there are some specific reason why that's happening. We say, we call it, heritage brands. And Lauder and Clinique where the initiatives that we supported have been very successful. But the base business, especially in July, August, was softer than we expected. And this was because the environment, first of all, there was low traffic in store, lower traffic in store than what we expected. As I said, improved dramatically in September. And second reason was that the environment was very promotional and our brands where, any moment, where their focus was on the innovation. So that was, clearly, not a competitive level of promotions during this period. Now we believe that our promotion, our competitiveness, during the holiday season will be dramatically improved. Our programs are much stronger, in this sense, however, we do not plan to increase promotions for the long term. Operator : Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Fabrizio, can we talk a little bit more about fragrances? It sounds like that continues to be a major initiative for you guys. Could you just help us contextualize kind of the size and scope of the family fragrances that you have and maybe who you expect to kind of be some of the newer ones that could become the bigger ones? And just clarify, related to that, is that really kind of based on global point of distribution, is that how you're kind of thinking about it, because obviously, Jo Malone is going to be more prestige and premium than maybe even a Michael Kors. But just help us understand kind of how big some of these fragrance families could be. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, sure. I think we will grow our fragrances substantially in this year and the next few years. Our fragrance portfolio is, first of all, very strong and they're very high-end, meaning Jo Malone, Tom Ford, these fragrances are, first of all, is profitable business and is growing very fast, more than double-digit or more and is growing globally. For the moment, very strong in Europe and North America and with a lot of future potential also in Asia. The second group of our fragrances are the fragrances which are part of our cosmetic brands, namely Clinique and Lauder fragrances. In this portfolio, this year our most important launch in this part of the portfolio, our more important launch is Modern Muse of Est\u00e9e Lauder. We believe this is a very strong fragrance. Our test and our early acceptance in the market is outstanding, has been going #1 in Harrods and is already #10 in the U.S. after a few weeks of launch and continue progressing and climbing the ranking as I said. And we have also a pretty solid promotion level in fragrance, as I said, during the holiday season, including the Clinique brand. And then the third group of -- in our portfolio, the designer fragrance, like Michael Kors, Tory Burch, DKNY, et cetera. And this portfolio particularly includes 2 very strong and important new launches, 3 actually. One is Michael Kors, that I said has been very successful in the launch in the United States and this is why we will expand in Europe soon. Tory Burch, for the moment, is exclusive to Bloomingdale in the U.S. and is the #1 fragrance there. And Zegna, which is being a global brand, launched from the beginning where the super-high aesthetician are actually in Asia because of the high position of the Zegna brand, particularly in China. And we believe that these combinations of activity will drive our growth in fragrance. We will go back growing market share in fragrances. We will improve our retail -- travel retail business in fragrances, which was one of the key goals, which is very profitable. And each one of these new fragrances that will be launched will carry high profitability versus our historical fragrance profitable model. Operator : Your next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I've got one follow-up question and one bigger question. I think you indicated that you think that your U.S. performance in department stores will be better in the December quarter than the September quarter because you're doing more, I guess, planned promotional activity. Could you just comment on whether that's the case? And then the other question is, you are guiding to margin expansion, operating margin expansion for the year. In -- which are the business segments that are going to lead that? In other words, will skin care be up the most and fragrance margins be down? Or where are we going to see the margin expansion for the year by business segment? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. I'll take the first one, which is, yes, you understood correctly. We believe that our trend in October, December in department stores in term of market share will improve, and will improve, first of all, because our innovation and the investment behind our innovation that we did in July, September will have an impact and our innovative product will continue growing. And second, because we will invest behind the fragrance launches, which will hit the holiday season. And third, because our promotional competitiveness will be stronger. I also want to remind that 60% of the fragrance sales in the United States happen during the holiday season. That's why we are focusing our fragrance investment and promotions in that period this year, and we have expectation to make. In term of the -- what will drive profit margin, I'll let Tracey comment on that. Tracey Thomas Travis : So we typically obviously don't guide by product category. So we do expect from a total portfolio standpoint to have the margin expansion. I would comment, though, on fragrances and remind you that we have a number of new fragrance launches this year, so it is a heavy, heavy investment year for fragrance. In light of those launches, which will continue to build not only in terms of the doors that we've launched them in, but we're also phasing the rollout of some of these fragrances so they will continue to build distribution as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I want to focus in on the organic sales growth in a couple of areas that seemed a little bit light to me versus my expectations. One is in travel retail. 9% looks like a decent headline number but not really when you contemplate the easy comparison and the lapping of the destock that hit the 2-year deceleration is pretty stark. So I was hoping you could help me understand maybe the drivers of that. And similarly, this is a rare quarter when your Americas like-for-like growth actually lags what was reportedly measured in NPD. Was there something anomalous about that as well? Fabrizio Freda : So speaking about travel retail. Our retail in travel retail was 13% growth, and our net sales were 9% and this was also driven by time of launch of many initiatives like Advanced Night Repair and DDML. So our travel retail business is actually growing double-digit. And in fact, we forecast, we guide to continue driving double-digit in the next quarters and is very strong in this moment, as I said in my initial comment, particularly in Asia. On North America, I didn't completely understand the question. Tracey Thomas Travis : It was the difference between our net sales and then the NPD growth, which obviously NPD does not measure all of our sales channels. But on the other thing that I would remind you of is a small amount, but in order to support some of the skin care fragrance launches that we had at the beginning of the quarter, we did ship in product at the end of June in order to support the July launches. Operator : Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : My question is why you're so confident in the margin expansion in the back half, because it's going to require a really major recovery across the board or maybe it's not in fragrance, it sounds like fragrance may stay down for the year to support the launches. But you're expecting tough comps in this coming quarter because of the lack, I understand that completely, but what gives you such confidence that you can continue to grow 6 to 8 top line if you cut back A&M [ph] in the back half to be flat as a percent of sales for the year, which I think you had guided to last quarter? Fabrizio Freda : The first thing I would like all of you to notice that anyway, we are delivering 2/3 of our profit in the first 6 months. So in the second 6 months, we have an equal amount of sales and, historically, 1/3 of our profit. So clearly, as Tracey commented on, we have the flexibility in the second quarter to invest and support our business and to deliver the profit growth that we want to deliver. And the way the quarters have been historically built, been very, very heavy in the first 6 months and lighter in term of profit in the second 6 months. This is also dependent by calendarization and by many other aspects. So we are calendarizing our initiative and our investments, I believe, in a more appropriate way this fiscal year. But most importantly, we are calendarized based on the consumer needs and the kind of innovation we have rather than just working on last year or previous years' comparisons. So all in all, we are confident in the overall fiscal year. We are confident that we can accelerate margin in the second 6 months of the year. Tracey Thomas Travis : And the only thing that I would add to that is even though certainly we have some soft environments that we are managing in, EMEA and certainly North America, the fact that many of our very strong large innovation launches happened at the beginning of the year, we expect that those products will continue to build momentum throughout the year, which certainly should help the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from David Wu with Telsey Advisory. David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : I just have a question for Carl. Can you perhaps talk about how you envision skin care innovation to evolve really over the next 5 years? Just given the demographic shifts with the aging baby boomers, as well as the new millennials as a new customer base. And also just given the changing consumer trends that you're seeing whether it's increasing use of beauty tools or sort of fusion products into other categories such as with CC creams? Carl Haney : Sure. Our innovation is balanced and competitive in product development across all our categories, including skin care. And as I said, we use a number of types of innovation against that. And our future pipeline is even more robust, it's bigger and broader. We leverage -- launch leverage. We are locally relevant. We're focused on the specific segments of growth and we're creatively driven and consumer inspired. So that's a long-winded way to say that we've developed capabilities to target consumer opportunities in fast-growing segments. The aging consumer is a large and fast-growing opportunity and we've developed innovation pipelines against those targets. And I won't get into specific details on them, but we a have very robust pipeline against those consumer targets. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just I guess on fragrances. 2 things, Fabrizio, 1 is, how do you think about the incremental margin on the growth of the business going forward with a greater focus on fragrance as opposed to skin and makeup? And I get that the fragrances that you guys are launching are higher profitability fragrances, but I suspect still lower than the broader portfolio. And then secondly, obviously, mass is -- well, share the prestige in most categories more recently, probably less so in fragrance. Do you think going forward that prestige will source a big portion of its growth from mass over the next 6 to 12 months especially with your initiatives in fragrance? Fabrizio Freda : So on profitability of fragrances. As I said, fragrances improved profitability in the last 5 years within the organization and within our company, and that was that one. Second, our new fragrance launches will have ongoing better profitability. Third, our portfolio is within fragrances as a mix, which is toward higher profitability fragrances like our high-end, like Jo Malone, which I already mentioned. And third, the growth on fragrances will allow us to leverage productivity and all the rest across the organization, across the entire Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, and this will be a positive factor. So that's why we believe that the growth of fragrance would be anyway creating value for us in the future. Said this, fragrance will remain a lower margin than skin care and makeup in our portfolio. You'll need to have one category which is less margin than the others anyway in any portfolio, and that's the reality of what we have. On your second question, which is the question on sourcing for mass, I would like to say, that's been our strategy now for 4 years, and this is probably the key idea behind our success in the last 4 years in term of accelerating growth is being that on top of competing for market share we deem prestige. We put ourselves as category builder, as the only company in cosmetic completely -- or big company in cosmetic completely focused on prestige and without any other mass business. And so, as great partners for our retailers, they want to build a category in prestige around the world. And with this strategy, we have been working in sourcing from mass in skin care and makeup. And as you have seen in the United States, we succeeded. And even in this last quarter, the prestige market in the United States, although softer than last year because as you've seen below 3.2% versus 7% last year, has been growing faster, decisively faster than mass. Now, we believe that this could happen also in fragrances in the future and this could be a trend that we will see also in the fragrance business. Although for the moment, in the fragrance business, this trend is being less remarkable that has been in skin care and in makeup. Operator : Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : I just had a quick housekeeping and then a little more fragrances actually. And the housekeeping was about, Tracey, if you can help us quantify the impact of currencies. It seems like it's better than you anticipated and how much of that was driving your increasing EPS over the course of the years? Can you help us quantify that? And then -- and I do want just a little bit more on fragrances because the pushback I'm getting from some investors is that is this the best ROI that Est\u00e9e Lauder can find? So why don't we go into more tier 3, tier 4 cities in China for the same money, or more e-commerce or, in fact buying back more stock than investing in fragrances. So it feels like folks are thinking, well, maybe they're stretching a little bit into margin dilutive areas to grow, and what's your response to that. And also kind of in that context talk a little bit more if you could about the dividend raise, which seems a little bit lower than it's been in the past and how that should make us think about the priority we give to that versus M&A or other uses of cash? Fabrizio Freda : So I'll take the fragrance part and Tracey will cover all the others and then comment also on the fragrance part the way she thinks. On fragrances, I want just to remind you that the role of having a strong fragrance business is not only about the value creation and margin creation. It's also in certain parts of the world, the fragrance are such a big part of the business that in order to create the critical mass of the company, that then will absorb all the reds, being able to serve retailers and cover the market appropriately. In absence of a strong fragrance business, this is going to be very costly and skin care and makeup can be much less profitable because of this. Example of this are many European markets, example of this is Latin America and there are many other example in Asia. Then second point is, fragrances are attracting new consumers to counters in many cases. So for example, on our Est\u00e9e Lauder Clinique brands, a strong fragrance business is also a source of customers for the counters. And then these people buy also skin care and makeup, and so it's the driver. So fragrance can be profitable, can be value creating and can be an enhancer of critical mass of the company and finally, of building or bringing new consumers to our brands and sell our entire portfolio. So they're an integral part of our strategy even if skin care in China in the long-term may create more value, still there is space for a strong fragrance business in our portfolio, but never detracting priority level from skin care and makeup, however. Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis : Regarding currency, as we have taken up the midpoint of our range, a small portion of that certainly is related to the improved outlook in currency. As I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did initially expect that currency would impact us by about 2% from a top line standpoint. We now expect that it would impact us negatively 1% to 2%. The euro is doing slightly better. Others are doing slightly worse, and we certainly saw that in the first quarter from a netting standpoint. So from a full year standpoint, there could be a $0.07 differential in EPS. But our decision to take up our guidance is somewhat related to currency, but the other is to be in the first quarter related to performance as well. In terms of dividends, you asked about that and our increase in the dividend. We look at, along with the board every year, distribution to shareholders, and the mix of distribution to shareholders between dividends and share repurchases. And what we were comfortable with, given our plans this year, is very similar to prior years in that the free cash flow that we deliver this year is almost 100% delivered to shareholders and in the mix of share repurchases and dividends. So through discussions and analysis and prudent planning with the board, this is the mix of distribution that we've decided is appropriate for us as a company this year. But it is a heavy focus of us -- of ours in terms of distributing back to shareholders what excess cash. We still, obviously, have a pretty very strong balance sheet, both from a debt capacity standpoint and from a cash standpoint. So we believe that any acquisitions that we might be considering, we can certainly fund with our balance sheet. Operator : Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Follow up on the travel retail question. Is it your sense that you are gaining share in travel retail, and maybe if you could specify if you think it's travel retail globally or are you gaining share in Asia travel retail or maybe not in Europe. So if you could clarify that? And then the second question, Tracey, just a follow-up on the inventory days, 195 seems really, really big to me. And I would've thought that I know you've got a big whatever holiday planned with fragrance, but at the same time, I would've thought you have already done a lot of that ship in. So had you anticipated 195, because it just seems like that number is getting higher and higher on -- and that maybe as you bring that down or work through that excess inventory, there's going to be a negative margin impact? Fabrizio Freda : So in travel retail, we are definitely building market share and we are building strongly the market share. The market share build is very strong in Asia, a little bit in Europe and we are now building in this moment market share in the U.S. part of travel retail. That's the split. And we are actually accelerating the market share buildup in the Asia part of the business. Tracey Thomas Travis : And in terms of the inventory days, you may recall that we did carry higher levels of inventory post the group 3 go live for SMI, as we had some stock issues that we were working through. So we ended the year higher. I would say that we were not expecting quite as high a level in the first quarter as we had. But the inventory is current, and so it is certainly salable throughout the second and the third quarters, as I mentioned. We never were relaunching new products or launching new products, in the case of our fragrances. We want to make sure, depending on what the sell-through is, that we have enough inventory. So that will provide some level of variability to our inventory levels when we have big launches like what we had in the quarter. But we have, to your point, shipped some holiday and are certainly shipping more as we speak. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I'm curious about your thoughts of using gift repurchase for this holiday season, sort of just broadly how you're thinking about that and then more specifically, is that amount could be higher or lower this year versus, call it, a year ago level? Fabrizio Freda : So we have -- as I said, we have a group promotional activity in the holiday season, which is not only gift repurchases, it's also relative to all the fragrance activity that happen there. And we believe we have a competitive gift repurchase program in the period of October, December. However, in the quarter where we just closed, the July, September, as I said, we were actually declining if we purchased versus the past. We were continuing our program, and that's one of the reason I was saying we were not competitively promotional in that quarter. In term of our program, we plan to improve our gift repurchase quality and activities in the future to make sure they work better and better with the consumers. And we are working with it. We have seen this and already in September, we have seen, for example, a very, very strong gift repurchase activity on the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, it was particularly successful. Operator : Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just first one point of clarification on advertising spend, you mentioned it would be up for the December quarter. Can you just say in terms of absolutely or as a percentage of sales that you expect it up because correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that there's quite a bit already in the base. And then on the inventory levels, obviously higher from your standpoint, but how does your inventory levels, how do your inventory level at retail look? Tracey Thomas Travis : So our advertising is -- for the second quarter is deleveraging about 40 basis points as a percent of sales. So that's the increase in the spend in the second quarter, the advertising promotion and marketing. And in terms of our stock-in-trade, it really varies around the world. But in general, I don't think we have a situation where we have lots of -- an abnormal amount of stock in any area of trade. Operator : Your final question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Quick, 2 things. One would just if you could comment on Russia, because there's no mention of that made last quarter, but perhaps it was starting to stabilize. I just curious on trends there. And then the second thing was just longer-term on hair care. No, I won't keep asking about fragrance in the strategic importance. I think within prestige beauty, it should actually be pretty clear. I think hair care, given both the margin structure and hair care size in global prestige beauty is actually been more interesting long-term strategic question. So could you talk a little bit about how do you think that evolves over time and sort of the near-term kind of returns in profitability goals for hair care, because I noticed a lot of advertising on TV this quarter for Aveda and you mentioned specifically in the release that Bumble had some new specialty distributions? Fabrizio Freda : So on Russia -- Russia as, I said, is stabilizing and is stabilizing because we read some parts of the retail was going well. Anyway, we have stabilized the relationship with the retailers that was not going well and because we have started an aggressive distribution change in Russia with more freestanding stores of the brand that carry freestanding stores and good online business. So it's a mix of stabilization and diversification of our distribution that is giving to us more confidence about us being able to go back in the future years to grow our business in Russia. In term of hair care, we are having a very successful moment in hair care. Aveda has a huge momentum. Aveda is growing momentum with salons, which remains the critical and key channel for Aveda in the United States and in other countries of the globe. And Invati is driving the success in Aveda freestanding store, and importantly in Aveda salons. And we -- yes, you're right, you're seeing advertising on Aveda on Invati, which is basically our activity to drive and support the best innovation and build on strengths and drive initiative where we see that is an enormous consumer traction and consumer reaction. And also, we continue Aveda expansion around the world and most important in the travel retail channel where particularly in Asia, we are seeing great traction for the brands, which has a very positive impact also on profitability.

Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Thia Breen, Group President of North America for The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. Thia is going to give us the strategic overview of the region and a review of the holiday results. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. In addition, we will discuss results before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the prior year quarter due to the implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and in the Investor Relations section of our website. And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to say that by executing our strategy successfully, we delivered strong sales growth in the fiscal 2014 second quarter, in line with our expectation and at the same time, advanced our business in many important ways. Our strong performance came despite a mixed holiday season and several soft retail markets across the globe. Our balanced portfolio enabled us to capitalize on our winning brands, geographies and channels, culminating in strong sales growth. We introduced exciting innovations, gained shares in pivotal markets, including China and the U.K., and increased our brand's penetration around the world. Our sales performance continue to an unbroken record of growth over the last 4.5 years. Since our current structure began, our business has grown every single quarter, which underscores the strengths of our long-term plan. In the most recent period, sales rose 4% in local currency. However, reflecting our true underlying business, sales grew more than 7% after adjusting for the $94 million of accelerated retail orders recorded in the second quarter last year prior to our Strategic Modernization rollout. To put that performance in perspective, our 7% sales increase is about double our estimated annual prestige beauty growth worldwide. Our results were especially noteworthy given the headwinds we face, including heavy promotional activity in our largest markets. Diluted earnings per share came in at $1.09, which was better than we had forecast. We overachieved our estimate by leveraging our strong results in several markets in high-profit channels and driving down costs. The beauty of having a diverse portfolio of 30 prestige brands is the balance and sustainability it provides. If some brands experienced a period of softer growth, it has been our experience that they are more than offset by others which are flourishing. Similarly, if mature channels or countries grow slowly, that's usually been more than counterbalanced by faster-growing channels and emerging markets. One of our strongest areas in the recent quarter was our makeup category, which remains critical to our growth. So we were pleased the sales rose sharply. M-A-C's ability to tap into consumer desire with a constant streams on new collection led to strong demand for its Holiday sets and its Rihanna products. M-A-C continue to build distribution by opening freestanding store and department stores doors primarily in international markets. At Smashbox, the brand concentrated on foreign expansions in the U.K. and Germany and entered Russia and the Netherlands for the first time. Smashbox also saw its good momentum continue at home in its core North America market. In Bobbi Brown, retail sales rose double digits in North America and the United Kingdom. Our 3 makeup brands each gained share in prestige beauty in the United States accordingly to NPD. Strong product launches from brands such Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, most notably in foundations and eye products, also contributed to makeup sales gains. Adjusting for SMI shift, our skin care sales grew solidly. However, the category has been extremely competitive. Skin care remains our key priority, and we are focused on continuing to profitable growth in the category. Our recent skin care innovations helped to drive the category growth this quarter as some of those gains were offset by decline in some existing products. This year's biggest launches, Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion + and Est\u00e9e Lauder New Advanced Night Repair serum, were well received. Our luxury skin care brand, La Mer, enjoyed strong retail trends globally, especially North America and travel retail, despite being up against its soft cream launch in the previous year which was its most successful launch ever. Much of our global innovation will continue to be centered on skin care, and we are committed to remaining a leader in developing the most advanced skin care technology for a host of skin care for consumers in every region. In fragrance, our business as a whole did well. With the category, we had mixed results. Our high-end offerings continue to excel globally. In the holiday seasons, Jo Malone retail sales in our heritage market of the U.S. and U.K. each soared at least 20%. Tom Ford fragrances were popular worldwide, and the brand launched the men grooming collection, which helped lift sales. The men collection is also displayed in a second relocation in stores, creating greater visibility. Tom Ford high-end distribution expansion continued, particularly in the European region. We also saw terrific response to several new fragrance launches. Tory Burch was the best-selling fragrance at Bloomingdale's, where it was sold exclusively during the quarter. Michael Kors new fragrance collection did very well everywhere it launched in the U.S. and Europe, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Modern Muse fragrance got off to a very good start, performing as we expected. Other scents from our beauty brands also were popular holiday gifts. However, some of our Designer Fragrances and Clinique fragrances didn't offer major new products, and they came up short of our expectations. Nonetheless, we gained share in fragrance in U.S. prestige store during the important second quarter. Aveda led our improvement in the hair care category with additions to its best-selling product lines. In the U.S., growth came from salons and online. Its U.K. sales were particularly good, spurred by TV advertising and 3 new retail stores. In addition, we doubled Aveda business in travel retail. Now looking at our business based on where our brands are sold. Some of our best-performing global channels were online, travel retail and freestanding stores. Our e-commerce sales rose significantly. We had strong growth across our brand sites, as well as authorized retailer sites worldwide. Our sharp sales increase anchored our position as one of the largest online prestige beauty retailers. The channel has been so successful and grown so fast that our e-commerce business has doubled in the last 3 years. We expect our online business to remain a major growth engine for the company over the next few years. With higher traffic and increased conversion driving our momentum, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence in these high-margin channels. And as an example, M-A-C launched e-commerce in Brazil and Israel in January. In travel retail, our net sales grew sharply, helped by retailers ordering for about 50 new point-of-sales and also in advance of an earlier Chinese New Year. Travel retail's growth was by far the stronger in Asia Pacific, led by business at Japanese airports which are more attractive to local and foreigner shoppers because of the weak yen. Our retail sales exceeded passenger traffic growth, and we expect that trend to continue for the rest of the fiscal year. For perspective, travel retail has also been a strong performer over the last 3 years as our net sales have climbed more than 70% and we gained more than 200 basis points on market share there. One of our strategic initiative is to align our distribution to evolving consumer preferences and growth opportunities in emerging markets. As part of that effort, we increased our network of freestanding stores, opening 57 this quarter, mostly for M-A-C. Our global sales in the channel grew double digits. We also continued our growth in specialty-multi retailers in North America. We had good momentum in this channel, and we are working to make some of our products available where appropriate in multi-brand stores in other countries as well. Turning to our geographies. Our sales in heritage markets performed well despite heavy promotional activity by brand and retailers as consumers sought value. The number of holiday promotion our brands offered was consistent with past years, but they started earlier since there were 6 fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In the U.S. and Canada, our retail sales climbed solidly on the strengths of online, specialty-multi and prestige department stores. Our strong sales growth in the U.K. was exceeded by even stronger retail sales with many brands and channels contributing. New doors and freestanding stores, compelling product and service, robust e-commerce and effective advertise made for a very positive holiday season. Japan economic expansion continued, which was reflected in our business. Our sales advanced in local currency, further strengthening this important market. We feel positive about the remainder of the year and have plans to advertise major launches in Japan with television and enhance our High-Touch services. Our underlying business in emerging markets continue growing double digits. To give you some example, sales in Brazil were vibrant, driven by M-A-C, Clinique and e-commerce, contributed to strong Latin America results. Russia, positive growth this quarter, reflecting solid retail demand and new doors opening. And sales in Turkey and the Philippines rose significantly. While China is clearly our largest emerging markets, all the others, taken together, represents another major opportunity for growth. Our combined sales in these emerging countries are actually greater than our China business, and our sales in this group grew double digits in local currency this quarter. Like the Chinese, more consumer in these markets are traveling more and also buying our products in travel retail location and along travel corridors. In China, prestige beauty growth remains solid even though it has slowed. The slowdown has been concentrated in Tier 1 cities, while the smaller cities are generating good growth. We have aligned our strategy to this reality and opened in 6 new Tier 3 cities during the quarter. Our 14 brands sold in China maintain the leading position among prestige cosmetic groups in our distribution. Additionally, when looking at the Chinese market, there are other factors to keep in mind, namely that although disposable income among Chinese middle-class consumer is rising, they are buying more outside the country when traveling. While these issues have led to lower department store traffic, our sales in China adjusted for SMI shift remained solid, our retail sales grew mid single digit and we continue to gain share. Our robust sales growth online and in freestanding stores contributed to our improvement. And although these channels are a small part of the total Chinese sales, we expect them to represent a greater portion in the coming years. Some countries remained challenging, including Korea, where the pace of recovery in prestige beauty remains slow. However, several of our brands there are showing improvements and gained share, including Aveda and Darphin, and our travel retail sales in Korea grew. Thanks to more Chinese travel with greater purchasing power. Some large countries in Continental Europe were soft, particularly Germany which was weaker than we expected, Italy and Switzerland. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment in Venezuela continues to be volatile. The country persistent high inflation poses a risk of potential currency devaluation, which could have a negative impact on our financial results, so we are closely monitoring the situation. Our main focus for the rest of the fiscal year will be on our 2 biggest product categories, skin care and makeup, and we will launch major innovation in both areas throughout the second half. Makeup products that should create excitement include M-A-C VIVA GLAM Rihanna lip products, which we expect to generate a high level of media attention. Additionally, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is launching the Pure Color Envy Lipstick collection, which features a new formula and lux packaging at a higher price point. The new line is part of the brand's ongoing effort to be more modern and aspirational. In skin care, we are demonstrating our commitment to the category through continued strong innovation supported by solid marketing activities. For instance, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are rolling out major innovation in Asia this quarter in one of the region's biggest categories, watery lotions. Est\u00e9e Lauder Macro Essence Skin Activated (sic) [Activating] Treatment Lotion is the first of its kind essence in lotion that helps strengthen skin foundation and make it more resistant to signs of aging. Clinique's Even Better Essence Lotion, which is launching in Japan now, helps irritation irradiance [ph] with the newly developed complex. Tapping into a universe of skin care concern, next month, Clinique will introduced an acne product that delivers results as effective as a leading topical prescription drug. The product, Acne Solutions Clinic Clearing Gel, rollouts first in the U.S. and Europe and then in Asia. To support these innovations, we plan to invest more in advertising in our fiscal third quarter, which we believe will build momentum also into the final months of our fiscal year. We are proud of the progress we've made so far this year, and we believe fiscal year 2014 will be another winning chapter in our company long-term profitable growth story. We expect global prestige beauty to rise 3% to 4% in fiscal 2014, and our forecast is to grow about twice as fast, which will continue to improve our competitive position. We recognize that our risks in some markets are softening, but we have proven our ability to anticipate challenges, be flexible and react to market changes in order to manage our business accordingly. We stay focused on meeting our financial goals and have demonstrated our ability to succeed in both strong markets and soft ones. And also because whether you look at our business by brand, by channel or by country, about 1/3 of our sales are increasing by double digits, while the rest is keeping at least abreast of the industry. Before closing, I want to thank all of our company employees for their continued creativity and dedication. Their exceptional work is what keeps us -- our strategic journeys moving forward to continue to create profitable growth. Now I'll hand it over to Thia, who will discuss our North America business and strategy. Thia Breen : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me give you a little background about myself. I am Group President, North America, and have led our teams in the U.S. and Canada for the past 4.5 years. I've been with Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies for more than 35 years in several brands and varied positions, starting as an account executive for Clinique in 1977. When I was appointed to lead North America in July 2009, we renewed our focus on the U.S., our largest and home market, to reinvigorate our department store growth, working to enhance their competitiveness with mass, as well as fuel sales in other high-growth channels. We developed a winning strategy and enhanced market-specific capabilities. This enabled us to continue to leverage the company's strengths and best practices in a more efficient and effective manner across brands and retailers with one strong voice. For us, North America also includes Canada, which is one of the top 10 markets for prestige beauty globally with many opportunities for growth. To capitalize on these opportunities, we established Canada as an affiliate in 2012 and have seen increased sales results. With this distinct focus on the U.S. and Canada, we've been able to successfully recruit consumers from mass by creating more innovative product, offering customized High-Touch services and experiences and tailoring marketing programs for specific consumers. This strategic focus has led to strong results for North America. Over the past 4 years, we have grown retail sales by approximately $1 billion and continue to be the leader in prestige beauty in both markets. Now I will focus specifically on the U.S., first talking about holiday in the quarter, followed by what we see as the longer-term trends. Our U.S. holiday business was solid, driven by outstanding programs across all categories, appealing gift offerings and strong online sales. This year, the holiday environment was more promotional. We started planning for this well in advance, understanding December would have 6 fewer selling days and that our growth in November would need to outpace December. Our November results were strong with double-digit sales increases driven by robust performances across our portfolio of brands, channels and categories. We gained share in the fragrance category led by new scents like Est\u00e9e Lauder's Modern Muse, Tory Burch and the Michael Kors collection. We experienced record online sales for the quarter, over 25% versus last year. And Cyber Monday marked our company's biggest U.S. e-commerce sales day in history, a reflection of our online leadership and commitment to building winning platforms. Guided by our winning strategy, the U.S. continues to be an engine of profitable growth for the company. We have demonstrated our ability to win against mass, drive growth in department stores and succeed in high-growth channels, particularly evident by outstanding online results and double-digit increases in specialty-multi. We are also now gaining share in our fragrance category. In the quarter, we continue to grow our luxury fragrances, AERIN, Tom Ford and Jo Malone, along with our new fragrances in department stores. Our brands also continue to drive success in the makeup category. M-A-C, Bobbi Brown and Smashbox had very strong growth across all channels in the second quarter. In addition, we have seen positive results with new offerings like Tom Ford Beauty. We expect these sales trends to continue with a robust launch calendar of new products, such as Est\u00e9e Lauder's Pure Color Envy Sculpting Lipstick and Nail Lacquers coming in March, and Clinique's Lash Power Feathering Mascara launching in April. In hair care, Aveda has continued solid performance and gained share on salons, driven by the success of Invati. Although we did have growth in skin care last quarter in North America, these gains did not meet our expectations. As Fabrizio mentioned, we saw softening with some existing products. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we are focusing on strengthening our position in skin care, with the introductions of new innovations in key subcategories like moisturizers, anti-aging and acne. We will continue to leverage our ability to execute with excellence to reignite stronger growth in this priority category. We are a strong leader in prestige beauty in North America and believe we will continue to win by identifying new ways to strengthen our position. North America on a granular level is full of new consumers, diverse in terms of ethnicity, culture, age, location, shopping preferences and so much more. We are evaluating the market to identify and prioritize the area with the highest growth potential and see opportunities here similar to those in a fast-growing emerging market. Driven by our creativity and innovation, we are developing strategies across regions, consumer segments, key accounts doors and channels to tap into these opportunities and drive growth. The composition of our consumers continues to evolve in the U.S., culturally and generationally, and we are focusing on key customer segments to drive growth, specifically multicultural and consumers over 55. The Latina consumer is the fastest-growing group. Among our many early initiatives to serve the multiethnic consumer and meet her product needs, several of our brands have added multilingual service elements, tailored product assortments and multiethnic models in advertising. Over the next 5 years, the population of women in U.S. 55 and older will increase by 5 million. We refer to this key segment as the ageless consumer. These consumers shop primarily in department stores for prestige beauty and have 2.5x more household income than younger households. Many of our brands resonate extremely well among ageless consumer as we offer innovative antiaging technologies along with High-Touch service. We also see opportunities on a door-by-door basis with key consumer segments driving category and subcategory growth. For instance, if you take a closer look at our biggest retailer in the U.S., Macy's, and 3 of its stores within a 12-mile radius of New York City, you see significant differences. In Queens - Rego Park, the Latina consumer drives a majority of the beauty sales, while African American consumers over-indexed in Brooklyn, and fragrance accounts for about half of our beauty sales in both locations. In contrast, just a few miles away at Macy's in Flushing, nearly 2/3 of the business is in skin care as consumer demographic shifts heavily to East and Asian. In each location, we have tailored our brand's presence, service model, product lines, shades and merchandising to better serve each customer segment. Retail today is omni-channel, which presents another significant opportunity. Consumers expect a consistent and customized experience at every touch point, whether they're shopping on their mobile phone, laptop, tablet, in-store or in travel retail. We plan to leverage our strong online business and network of freestanding stores to ensure a seamless prestige experience no matter where she shops. We are confident North America will continue to grow, given our focus on identifying emerging opportunities across regions, consumer segments, key accounts doors and channels. Led by my dedicated team, we expect this granular approach to generate profitable, sustainable growth, maximizing the infrastructure, capabilities and resources we have as an established market. We are excited about the company's future in North America, and we look forward to leveraging our portfolio and strengthening our leadership position. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis : Thank you, Thia, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our second quarter financial performance and then share with you our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the year-over-year impact of restructuring and other charges. And as the quarter and year-to-date comparisons are impacted by the company's Strategic Modernization Initiative or SMI activity in the prior year period, I will highlight for you both the reported and adjusted comparable growth rates, which I would encourage you to reference as well in this morning's press release. Net sales for the second quarter rose 3% to $3.02 billion, in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales grew 4%. Net earnings and earnings per share each decreased 6% to $430.2 million and $1.09, respectively. EPS was above the top end of our expectations, reflecting strong growth in our makeup artist and luxury brands and high-profit channels and more disciplined cost management in response to some softening market trends. As we have previously discussed, in the prior year, some retailers accelerated their orders into our second quarter that otherwise would've occurred in our third quarter in advance of the January 2013 rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift was an additional $94 million in sales and $78 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.13 per share. Excluding the impact of the SMI-related order shift and the restructuring activities from last year, local currency sales would have grown 7% for the quarter, and EPS would've grown 6%. Looking at our sales growth by region. Net sales in our Americas region increased 6% in local currency, with 4% growth in North America and double-digit growth in Latin America. The strongest performance in North America at retail came from double-digit sales growth, both in online, as well as in specialty multi-brand stores, as Thia indicated, and high single-digit growth in our freestanding stores and at prestige department stores. Latin American growth reflected increases in Brazil, Venezuela and Chile. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, sales also increased 6% in local currency. We achieved double-digit growth in emerging markets such as Russia, South Africa and Turkey. The U.K. delivered a strong 9% increase in sales driven by strong performances in M-A-C, Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown and Aveda. Among the more established markets in Western Europe, France rose mid-single digits after adjusting for the SMI shift in the prior year, and we were encouraged that Iberia appears to have stabilized after declining for the past 2 years. Sales in Switzerland, Italy and Germany were lower. And in travel retail, we achieved double-digit net sales grains, driven by the continued benefits of high single-digit international passenger traffic, combined with new distribution and an earlier Chinese New Year, all of which more than offset the impact of a change in Chinese tour regulations. Our sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 3% in local currency, reflecting the significant impact of the SMI-related sales shift in China last year. Excluding the shift, local currency net sales in the region increased 5% and China rose double-digits, reflecting more moderate retail sales growth and the addition of nearly 20 new doors and 6 new cities during the quarter. Australia, the Philippines and Singapore saw strong growth, and Japan continued its low single-digit growth. We believe Korea is beginning to stabilize with sales declines moderating to 3% this quarter. Sales in Thailand fell approximately 5%, as political and social unrest affected consumer shopping. In my discussion of margins and operating expenses, I will refer to the SMI-adjusted shift comparison, which provide additional insight into our underlying performance for the quarter. As I mentioned before, a reconciliation table to our reported results is included in our press release. Our gross margin improved 10 basis points to 80.7%, which largely reflected the net impact of pricing. Operating expenses -- expense dollars increased 5%. And as a percent of the SMI-adjusted sales, which grew 7%, operating expense margin declined 70 basis points to 59.1%. The major factors driving the decrease in margin were lower marketing and selling costs of approximately 60 basis points each, partially offset by a prior year adjustment of accounts payable of approximately 50 basis points. Operating income rose 11% to $652.8 million, and operating margin increased 80 basis points to 21.6%. Net interest expense declined 7% to $12.4 million, primarily due to higher interest income, and our effective tax rate was 32.4%. As a reminder, in the prior year, we recognized $21.3 million in other income related to the 2007 sale of the Rodan + Fields brand, which added approximately $0.04 to our EPS last year. For the 6 months, cash flow from operating activities rose 19% or $127 million, primarily reflecting improved receivables and payables performance. Inventory days to sell rose to 186 compared with 163 days last year. Higher inventory was mainly due to anticipated sales growth and increased safety stock to maintain appropriate service level. We invested $217 million in capital projects to support new counters, technology and retail stores. We repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our stock for $205 million and paid $148 million in dividends to stockholders. With the first half behind us, let's now turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year. Starting with the full year, due to slower trends in Greater China and Asia, travel retail and continued softness in parts of Europe, we are narrowing our expectations for fiscal 2014 sales growth to between 6% and 7% in constant currency, in line with the SMI-adjusted growth we experienced in the first half of this fiscal year. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 1% to 2%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of $1.33 for the euro, $1.59 for the pound and $1.03 for the yen. The combined benefits of gross margin expansion and operating leverage are expected to drive operating margin expansion by 50 to 60 basis points for the full year. As previously discussed, we continue to drive cost savings from our initiative program while simultaneously strengthening our capabilities in many areas, such as innovation, retail stores, e-commerce and information system that support our company's future growth objectives. Advertising, marketing and promotions are expected to remain fairly consistent as a percent of sales for the full year. As you are aware, Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy, and there are number of uncertainties that could affect our business. While the country currently represents approximately 1% of our sales and 2% of our operating income, a hypothetical 45% devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar could result in a remeasurement loss of approximately $20 million to $27 million after-tax, depending on both the timing and level of the devaluation. Additionally, Venezuela recently imposed a law limiting the permissible profit margin to 30%. For your clarity, our guidance does include the assessment of the potential impact of the margin cap but does not, at this time, take into account an assumption for the devaluation loss. Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is planned at 30% to 32%. At this time, we are comfortable reaffirming our forecast for full year EPS in the range of $2.80 to $2.87. Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movements, the approximately 1% to 2% negative currency impact on our net sales equates to about $0.05 of EPS. As a reminder, the next wave of our SMI rollout is scheduled for July 2014 and will include our North America order-to-cash, travel retail division, Japan and the Middle East. As has been the case in previous rollouts, we expect retailers will increase their orders in advance of the go-live to mitigate any potential disruptions from the transition. The impact of this potential shift in orders will be to increase sales into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year from our fiscal '15 first quarter. We plan to provide an estimate of the shift on our third quarter call in May when we expect to have a better indication of the needs of our retailers. The guidance we are giving today does not include this shift in sales and profits. For the third quarter, our sales are expected to grow 10% to 11% in local currency. Translation could contract growth by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points. We expect EPS will come in between $0.52 and $0.55. Remember that the prior year SMI shift in sales of $94 million or $78 million in operating income and $0.13 in EPS will have a favorable impact on comparisons in our third quarter. Adjusting for the shift, our sales growth is expected to be between 6% and 7% in local currency. Additionally, our tax rate is expected to be consistent with our full year guidance in the third quarter compared to the lower rate in the prior year quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just a quick question on some of the competitive activity you're talking about. If you could just provide a little bit of clarity on exactly kind of where it's coming from, if it's focused in a particular region or category, just to give us a little bit of color around that would be really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up to that, unrelated, is how did e-commerce impact margins this quarter? I'm just curious on what the mix shift impact was on profitability. Fabrizio Freda : So on the last one, how e-commerce impact margin, the more we grow e-commerce or online as a mix in our business, the better the margin goes because it's a high-margin channel for us. I don't think we can share specific indication and numbers, but basically, you need to associate the growth of online above average of the growth of the company to margin increase in general. The -- in terms of competitive activities, we see many. I mean, here in North America, the biggest competitive activity, and Thia can expand on it later, has been the promotionality of the holidays in general, and a lot of launches in the fragrance categories and the important activity in skin care, particularly in the cleansing and device areas. In Asia, we see a -- we see strong performance from us and some other international brands, but also we see strong performance from Korean brands that are growing market share in the region. And in terms of Europe, I think, it's the traditional competition, just that because of the recessionary environment that's been in general more promotional. Operator : Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Tracey, could you discuss your regional and profit results a bit more in the quarter? I was surprised Americas was up so much and then Asia looked weak, so I just wanted to get some detail on the drivers behind that. And also, ad spend you had slated to be up substantially year-over-year in Q2. I'm wondering, did you spend in line with that given SG&A came in better than we expected, or some of that shifting into Q3? Tracey Thomas Travis : Sure. So regarding our regional performance, as Thia indicated, we had a good holiday season in the North America and certainly in the U.S., so our growth was quite strong given some of the holiday programs that we had. In Latin America, as I mentioned, it was up double digits. So overall, from Americas standpoint, we certainly had strong growth as we -- as I spoke in the call and as we reflected in the press release. Asia had a number of issues, and even adjusting from an SMI standpoint, we continue to see, although we mentioned it was stabilizing, softer growth in Korea, we have low mid -- low single-digit growth in Japan. And then China was softer this quarter for the reasons that we mentioned. So the Asia region was a bit softer than we have experienced in prior quarters. And part of the reason that we looked to bring down our guidance for the full year was because of some continued softness although picking up in the second half of the year relative to what we've seen, certainly, in the fourth quarter. But we do expect some muted performance out of that region for the balance of the year. In terms of expenses and your question on advertising, yes, we did, as we looked at some trends in the quarter, did reduce some of our advertising spend and certainly some of our G&A spend. Operator : Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I have a question going back to some of the weakness in the skin care category, and maybe, Thia, this is for you. But is the weakness that you've seen in some of your existing products related at all to pricing that you might have taken? I know pricing is a new idea sort of for the company, and I'm wondering if you've taken some pricing and maybe pushed it too hard. And do you have a sense -- sounds like the new DDML+ is doing okay but maybe not as well as you had expected. Again, do you think the $1 price increase had any impact on that? And then just a quick question, Tracey, is there a specific time frame for when we might start to see improvements in the inventory levels? Thia Breen : So Wendy, it's Thia. The pricing really had nothing to do with the performance of whether it's Advanced Night Repair or DDML+, as evidenced in our tremendous growth that we've had in some of our high-end skin care such as La Mer. So it would not be a pricing issue. And we did very well with the new introductions. But as Fabrizio and I indicated, there was just more cannibalization in some of our existing products, a bit more than we had planned for. Certainly, as we move forward into the second quarter, we have looked at this, examined it and we focused our promotional -- our activity in terms of innovation to see a turnaround in skin care in the second half. Tracey Thomas Travis : And Wendy, regarding inventory, we are taking some various specific actions towards the end of the year to reduce our current level of inventory. We do, however, have another rollout of SMI. And so even though that's not in our financial results right now, that will result in a build -- of the residual build of inventory in addition to additional shipments towards the end of the year. So in fairness, I would say that our inventory levels will start to sustainably improve after this last wave of SMI when we can start to manage them down far more aggressively than we have been over the last couple of years with the SMI rollout. Operator : Your next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I have a couple of follow-up questions. Why do you expect your results in Asia, in China in particular, to pick up especially in the fourth quarter? And similarly, what are you doing to make skin care pick up again, it sounds like, by the fourth quarter? And the final part of that is, could you list which categories grow fastest in fiscal '14 adjusted for currency? I think in the past, it was skin, followed by color, followed by fragrance. Could you give us an update on that for global results and also for the U.S.? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. Well, we'll look at the ranking of categories. The -- let's talk about Asia. First of all, what's happening in Asia is a combination of factors, as we explained. First of all, in this moment, you have China with a slowdown. Let's talk first about that. The China slowdown is characterized by stronger slowdown in Tier 1 cities and in the luxury interest in general of Tier 1 cities population. But in Tier 2, 3, 4 cities, meaning the new population on China now, the growing middle class now are approaching more prestige products, actually the growth continued very solidly. So we are adjusting our strategy to this new reality. Meaning, we are building distribution and penetration in Tier 2, 3, 4 cities and aggressively building our online penetration in China. For example, the Clinique Tmall side has been extremely successful, and we are clearly ahead of goals. Because of this, we believe that we are sitting and adjusting our strategies to the new profile of growth in China, and in this sense, we should get better results even in a slowing down environment in the future months. By the way, we saw already a pickup in the month of January previous to the Chinese New Year. The second situation in Asia is temporary. I mean, Thailand is a big business for us, and Thailand, as we said, was minus 5% because of the political unrest. This was not expected, and we hope that as soon as Thailand will go to normalize the political environment, we'll continue to see the trend -- growing trends that, by the way, was double digit before the political unrest. So we are growing double digit to minus 5%. That's temporary. That's, obviously, for us, was a surprise. Then you have Korea that is stabilizing, although still declining. So we believe that in the next month, we will reach real stabilization and possibly, we will start growing again in this very important market for us. And then there are some good news that we have shared. Japan picking up, Australia doing better and the other markets like Singapore, Philippines really performing. So we believe this will pick up. Now in terms of skin care, in skin care, we are going back to do some innovation, which we believe in very strong in our key brands, which are what we define white spaces. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that Lauder and Clinique are entering the watery lotion category in Asia. To be very clear, this is a white space, so it's supposed to cannibalize much less because it's a space in which we are not and our competition is. And our products are superior, very strong, very liked by the consumers, so this will be net extra. Our skin care strategy in the future would be more focused on this net extra space. There are others which I cannot mention for competitive reasons that will happen in the last quarter. And then the example of Clinique Acne also is much more a white space for us, so it's a net extra additional space that our brands will build in skin care, by the way, in very profitable segments. And that's why we believe we will pick up again the trend in skin care. And I wanted to close saying, although in skin care, we have grown less than what we wanted in the quarter, we are still been growing and growing very well. Tracey Thomas Travis : And regarding your question on full year category growth, so makeup, as we've called out, has been a strong performer year-to-date, and we expect that it will continue to be a strong performer balance of the year. We are seeing tremendous, tremendous growth in our M-A-C brand and Tom Ford and others. So that will be our fastest-growing category. Second would be hair care, with the success of the Aveda brand and some of the expanded rollouts there. Third would be skin care. And as Fabrizio mentioned, we do have plans in the second half in addition to picking up in Asia that will impact the skin care growth to be faster in the second half than it was in the first half. So that's the ranking, and then fragrance would be last. Operator : Your next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Are we to assume that skin care margins will be down for fiscal '14? And then on the U.S., what have you expected U.S. category -- the U.S. category to grow at, and where do you see category growth now? And can you give a little bit more color on sales growth for the bigger brands versus the smaller ones, since it looks like the bigger ones were perhaps a bit more sluggish than you thought but the smaller brands are clearly more than offset? So is that growth disparity between those 2 ends of the portfolio widening? And what implications does that have on spending need and ability to leverage fixed cost by brands? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. I'll take this last one, while Thia and Tracey will prepare to answer the first 2 questions. Actually, you are correct. Our midsized brands are today growing in our portfolio faster than our biggest brand, with the exception of M-A-C which is one of our fastest-growing brand. And this is having a very healthy impact on our business because it's making our portfolio broader, meaning the amount of brands that, if growing, have a significant impact on our growth is increasing. And the fact that the midsized smaller brands today are becoming bigger and are growing faster is another balancing factor to our portfolio that actually reduce our risk of being exposed to 1 brand or another being soft for a short period of time, or being exposed to one competitor [ph] or another. So we are broadening our portfolio geographically, we are broadening our portfolio in terms of channel -- growing channel like the expansion in e-commerce as an example, and we are broadening our strengths by brand portfolio. All this is a very positive trend. Now, Thia? Thia Breen : In terms of the market and growth, we are thrilled because we are part of a dynamic market in terms of prestige beauty growth. If we take a look at the categories, department stores are certainly a major portion of our business today, and we have really figured out a way of attracting that mass consumer and recruiting for mass in our department store channel. We also have, in terms of high-growth channels, a tremendous growth in terms of online, also in terms of freestanding stores and specialty-multi. So we -- and you've seen the numbers and certainly makeup has been a key driver and it's a significant portion of our North American portfolio. We see the turnaround in terms of skin care, and Fabrizio had mentioned the white space in terms of acne and we have a new product in Est\u00e9e Lauder as well that attacks that. And certainly, as we look at it, because of this growing marketplace, we're going to be a major player and expand our leadership position. Tracey Thomas Travis : And lastly, regarding skin care margins, we do not expect them to be down for the full year. Obviously, skin care will grow a bit less than makeup. So from a mix standpoint, it will represent less of those margin mix upside for us. But that margin should be up year-over-year in the category. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I want to come back to China because, I guess, I'm still confused here. You gave us a lot of color, but I've heard some conflicting numbers. So first, can you just tell us what your growth in the market was, excluding the shift in retail ordering, both in all-in and same-store sales basis, as well as your view of the current category growth? And I guess a little more color on your deceleration. I suspect the same-store sales number is going to be behind where the category was growing. If so, what's driving the market share weakness? Fabrizio Freda : So what was the growth? Tracey Thomas Travis : So for the quarter, our comp growth adjusted for SMI was 10% in the quarter. And then in terms of the year-to-date number, so the 6-month number, the comp growth adjusted, Jason, was 16%. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. And in terms of our -- we are growing market share because we are growing in this market above the market trend, and so we continue to beat market share. And the strategy is to expand our penetration into Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities and online, which are within China, the fastest-growing segment of the market. So the strategy is pretty simple. We are exposing our brands to the fastest-growing segments of the market. And thanks to that, we are able to continue growing above the market. But however, the market is lowering and has lowered in the last quarter, and so that's -- those are the facts. Now the other important thing to understand are the China investment for taking a bit longer-term view is that the Chinese consumer continues to -- the middle class continues to grow and the Chinese consumers continue to spend. But they are -- some of them are traveling more, they're spending more when they travel in travel retail or in the countries they visit, and in a way, this is part of the reason why there's some slowdown internally, in our opinion. And so the combination of our sales with the Chinese consumer is still very, very strong, even if there is this slowdown trend internally. And that's the way we look at it for the long term. Operator : Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Just wondering, for both Thia and for Fabrizio, have you sort of given up on the idea or are you sticking with the idea that you don't want to be in the device business? Just given how successful L'Or\u00e9al has been there, it seems to be both a big and growing opportunity, and I know up until now you've said that's nothing that you want to do. Are you still of that view? And just similarly, with acquisitions, you spent a while getting Smashbox to perform as you hoped, I guess, and does that mean you're maybe more willing to step up to the plate now? And then just finally, the big investment in fragrance feels awfully disappointing looking at the results. And I'm just wondering if we could expect a big pullback in spending next -- as you move out because you're not getting the return on investment that you would've liked to have seen. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. Let me start on this last one. It's that -- we -- as you see, we are managing our business very flexibly and focus on our financial results and on maximizing return of our investments. So we learned, and we have learned this year that certain investment we mentioned before, some cannibalization of some skin care launches, we mentioned some countries, now you mentioned fragrances where we had lower return, in some cases, than what we expected, and frankly, higher returns in other cases. Within fragrances, I mentioned some great success stories in our launches in my prepared remarks, and I also revealed there were some areas where we did less than expected. So yes, you can expect us to adjust to this new reality and to learn from what we're doing, and to refocus and rebalance our investment in the future based on the successful stories, and minimize or avoid to invest in areas with wrong rate of return. The -- so there was the -- what's the other point? Dennis D'Andrea: Devices. Fabrizio Freda : Oh yes. The question on devices. Again, we watch the market, we watch the consumers and we learn. So I don't think we said never do anything about it, but we said that we were not going to launch devices at the point in time. The -- our strategy here is to try to create sustainable propositions to address the consumer benefits in that area, and we are working on it. So if we call it devices or different thing, or different kind of innovation, this is something I cannot discuss. But definitely, the benefit area of cleansing is a very important benefit area for the company, and we are going to address it in the future and I believe, very competitively. There was a third question. Tracey Thomas Travis : M&A. Acquisition. Fabrizio Freda : Acquisition, sorry. There were many questions. The acquisition, well, we continuously look at the market. We are very interested in growing acquisition. As you know, in our goals, we have the intent to build 1 point of growth out of acquisitions. So we are continually monitoring the market and we are ready to do the right steps when opportunity arises. Smashbox is a happy story so far, and we are definitely ready to consider opportunities if they arise. Operator : Your next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: My question has to do with your margin goal. Early back in August, I understood that you said that the expansion in margins dependent upon making marketing and promotional spending more efficient, and it seems like you are now being compelled to increase both because of competitors' activity and the recessionary environment. And the other point that is also pressing margins, in my view, has to do with China. I don't fully understand the characterization that you are changing the strategy there. We have been hearing about this expansion in Tier 2 to Tier 4 cities since 2012, and what's the point of making this spending in brick-and-mortar if incremental sales are going into travel retail and e-commerce? So if you can explain us where the impact of these 2 in your margin goals. Fabrizio Freda : I mean, on the impact on margin goals, to be clear, we have a strategy where all our high-growth areas are margin accretive. That's intentional. So travel retail, online, emerging markets, China, the new segments, skin care category, within skin care category, certain areas of benefit are all margin accretive. So our business is actually designed on purpose to grow faster in areas with higher marginality. And this is working so far. It's working very, very well. Now if you add cost-saving activity to this mixed asset, then you get the clear idea of what we are driving into margin progress and the way we're driving margin progress in long term. If you add to this the third element, which is leveraging growth with productivity gains, then you get the full picture. So I don't believe there is any risk in the strategy to decrease margin. Actually, I believe, we will continue to build margin gradually and we will relook our goals as opportunity arise and as our cost SMI saving programs become clearer. In terms of the China strategy, the -- I'm not sure -- I'm not very clear what you don't understand on the strategy because basically, the Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, the awareness of the brand today is low. Building brick-and-mortar there makes -- by the way, very efficient brick-and-mortars because few doors which sell a lot of products. And as you know, in our business, the profit is dependent from sales per door. So those few doors are very effective, very efficient. On top of this, they create awareness in this area, so these people that live in the city, when they travel, when they go online, buy our brands in travel retail, online or in Paris. And if we were not in the city to create awareness, first of all, we will have less productive doors; and second, we will not have the awareness for these people buying and preferring our brands in those channels. In that way, this strategy is definitely accretive to margin. Tracey Thomas Travis : And the only thing that I would add with respect to your commentary on advertising, marketing and promotion, we have spent against everything that we had planned to spend on at the beginning of the year. As -- and Fabrizio mentioned that we are flexible as we have seen results, we have recalibrated some of the levels of spending behind some programs. But by and large, we have spent against everything that we had planned to spend on as we structured the year. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : A few things. If I look at sort of the cash flow statement, obviously, cash flow from operations were up 19% for the year, but the share repurchase is down 37%. You obviously have this big, growing cash hoard and the multiple is coming down, so I couldn't think of a better opportunity to get more aggressive in the share repurchase. And I always thought the strategy was, we don't want to add any more leverage but we're perfectly content sweeping the cash that we generate from this point forward. So just any clarity on that? And then maybe I missed it, but can you just give us the actual travel retail sell-in and sell-through percentages? And then the real question, sorry for being so long-winded, but it seems like Clinique is having a real tough go of it right now especially in the U.S. So I wonder if there's a triage plan there, and I know there's tough comparisons, obviously. And then, if Jane being appointed as President of the business, if there's anything incremental that's going to happen with the brand? Tracey Thomas Travis : Okay, that was a lot. In terms of share repurchase, we see the opportunity that you see. And yes, we are still very committed to our share repurchase program. In terms of travel retail, I assume you were asking about the second quarter, and the net sales in the second quarter, as we mentioned, were up double digit, and the sell-through was high single digit for the quarter. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And then on -- yes, the question was Lauder and Clinique? Tracey Thomas Travis : Clinique. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, I think -- by the way, as I said, we had a very strong program in the future on Clinique, so we are very comfortable for the plan to restart more aggressive growth on the brand in North America. And maybe Thia to say a few words. Thia Breen : And Bill, one of the many things we've heard since the appointment of Jane Lauder in this role, I worked with Jane when she was in the marketing role, actually, many, many years ago at Clinique, and the retail partners, retail community and internally, everyone is just thrilled with the fact that we have a family member now heading up this brand. So I mean, everybody has great expectation, and Jane has all of our support in what will be a tremendous role for her with the Clinique brand. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. If you are unable to join for the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today through February 19. To hear a recording of the call, please dial (855) 859-2056, and enter passcode 31881764. That concludes today's Est\u00e9e Lauder Conference Call. I would like to thank you all for your participation, and wish you all a good day.",

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Cedric Prouv\u00e9, Group President of International for The Este\u00e9 Lauder Companies. Cedric will discuss strategy and current results for key markets outside of North America. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges, including a remeasurement charge related to Venezuela. In addition, we will discuss results before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the prior year quarter due to the implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative and the impact on our full year expectations of accelerated retail orders expected in the quarter ending June 30, 2014. You can find reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'll turn it over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our successful track record continued in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as our strategy helped us deliver excellent results. We have generated sustainable, profitable and uninterrupted year-over-year sales growth quarter after quarter for nearly 5 years. This achievement has been driven by our superb creativity and innovation, broad portfolio of prestige beauty brands, a business that's well diversified across categories, countries and channels and the flexibility to direct our investments to the best opportunities. In the third quarter, our sales rose 12% in local currency, slightly higher than our estimate. Diluted earnings per share before charges were $0.64, ahead of our forecast and up 42% from a year ago. Our strong performance came from leveraging our sales and rebalancing our marketing activities. We continue to be financially disciplined, with the flexibility to support strong growth areas while managing more prudently in others. As a reminder, last year third quarter sales reflected a shift of $94 million of accelerated orders into the second quarter in advance of our SAP rollout. Adjusting for the shift, our underlying local currency sales gain this quarter would have been 8%. That increase is approximately double the annual growth of prestige beauty, which we estimate will be 3% to 4% this year. Global prestige beauty continues to benefit from favorable demographics and attracting new consumers from mass. With our single focus on prestige beauty on a worldwide view into consumer trends identified by our 10-year compass, we have positioned our company in many of the fastest-growing and largest areas, making us confident we can continue outpacing the industry overall. With 30 brands and more than 10 distribution channels around the globe, virtually every part of our business can fuel our growth. Depending on local economies, the cadence of our innovation and changing consumer desires, various brands, categories, regions and channels can be star performers. The key for us is recognizing we're succeeding and being flexible, so as market dynamics change, we react quickly and put greater resources into the best opportunities, which has allowed us to excel and gain share globally. Over the course of the year, we rely on all parts of our business to drive our sales growth, but the contribution from our multiple engines will vary by quarter. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, China, our luxury brands and online drove much of our growth. In the second quarter, the U.S., U.K., makeup, travel retail and online led the way. In the third quarter, our emerging markets, Europe, M-A-C and our luxury brands accounted for much of our sales gains. Having many growth engines is one of our best attributes and illustrates the breadth and the depth of our business. They provide balance and reduce the risk of being overly dependent on any one part of our business to achieve sustainable, profitable growth. Our industry leadership was recently confirmed by a leading global market research firm. It reported that in calendar 2013, we strengthened our position by adding 20 basis points of share, reinforcing our status as the #1 company worldwide in total prestige beauty. We gained share in prestige skin care and makeup on a total global basis, as well as in some key markets and regions, demonstrating the strengths of our resource and location choices. Being nimble has allowed us to deliver strong results despite several challenging markets. Looking at our product categories, skin care and makeup remain our priorities since they account for the vast majority of our business and present the largest opportunities. Our skin care growth this quarter was significantly higher than last year's third quarter and also improved sequentially. We launched several important kinds of innovation to strengthen our global offering in this category. We are deploying more incremental innovation in areas where we either don't have a presence or our presence is limited. Examples of these white-space products are watery lotions, which are a key part of Asian skin care regimens and a large category in the region. Seizing an opportunity, several of our brands introduced products to fill this locally relevant segment. These lotions are just rolling out in Asia, and early results are very encouraging. Clinique's Even Better Essence Lotion has been the brand's biggest launch in Japan in more than a decade. It launches in China this quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder launched a high-performance product called Micro Essence Skin Activating Treatment Lotion. With its unique positioning as an essence in lotion, it has performed exceptionally well. La Mer introduced its own watery lotion a few months ago, and it continues to exceed our expectations. At the same time, we are protecting and modernizing our core franchises with the latest technology to keep them fresh and competitive, as we did with Clinique new Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ and the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand improved Advanced Night Repair Serum. They have performed in line with our goals. A third type of innovation we have been undertaking is bringing our brands into large existing categories they are not yet in. For instance, in this quarter, La Mer rolled out its Lifting Contour Serum and Lifting and Firming Mask, which comprised its first collection to address contouring and lift. Our makeup category also was strong, reflecting consumer's growing appetite for the newness products, which plays into many of our brands' strengths. This is especially valuable for M-A-C, which introduces something new just about every week, such as a product, color story, collaboration or locally relevant collection. This constant creativity gives it a competitive advantage. In the third quarter, there was a dramatic surge in lipsticks as M-A-C lipstick sales at retail climbed 25% in the U.S. prestige department stores. Lipsticks also helped lift the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand's makeup results. It's new Pure Color Envy Sculpting Lipstick collection, which features sophisticated packaging and intense pigments, was a huge success, particularly in North America and European region. Smashbox had a terrific quarter, thanks to strong demand for its new Full Exposure Eye Palette and selective distribution expansion internationally. Our luxury fragrance brands, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, turned in an outstanding performance again, with double-digit gains in every region. Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Modern Muse has resonated strongly with consumers. Among our new designer fragrance offerings, Tory Burch and the Michael Kors collection are the big success stories, exceeding our expectations. And sales of our Zegna Essenza collection had been strong. As a company, we achieved our goal of gaining share in fragrance in the U.S. in the third quarter on strong profitable sales, with most of our brands contributing. In hair care, products from Aveda's Dry Remedy franchise helped drive strong increases internationally, and sales to salons rose. Looking at our business by geography, we are the #1 prestige beauty player in many of the biggest markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, and also in some of the most important emerging markets such as China, South Africa and Brazil. Our growth is well balanced between established markets and developing ones, which provides another layer of stability. All of our regions had sales growth for the quarter, as well as the fiscal year-to-date. This quarter, we continue to grow our business in the U.S. and China, however, less than in the past because of softness in these countries. Despite the softness in these important markets, we still delivered strong growth as a company overall, which is another testament to the power of our diverse and broad portfolio and our strengths in many other markets. In North America, the retail environment was tough in the quarter due in part to severe weather in much of the U.S. and a late Easter. China remains our biggest emerging market priority, and we are confident that long-term fundamentals remain strong. Despite an expected decline in same-store sales, our strategy to expand distribution, bring in new brand and enter more cities, continue to be solid. In fiscal year '14, our company expects another year of double-digit sales growth in China, a trend we expect to continue over the long term. Aside from China, our other emerging market, which encompass 13 countries, grew healthy double digits combined, and their global total sales are bigger than our China business. Consumers in these countries comprise an important part of our travel retail business. The fastest-growing in this important group of emerging market were Brazil, Turkey and Central Europe. Our sales in the U.K. continue to be vibrant, and our business in most Western European countries is improving as prestige beauty is showing growth. Cedric will discuss our international business in more detail in a few minutes. Our goal of sustainably generating sales growth ahead of the industry is an outgrow of our compass, which identifies and validates promising areas of consumer interest and short-term trends. Some products stemming from the vision will launch in the coming months, including breakthrough innovation to bring incremental business. For instance, Clinique plans to introduce 2 state-of-the-art global product in the first quarter of fiscal year '15. One is a custom-fit serum that uses highly advanced technology to treat the ageless consumers in a way Clinique hasn't addressed before, incorporating a breakthrough formula. Clinique Smart Custom-Repair Serum is the brand's first serum that acts on different skin problem and on individual skin types. The other product, a cleansing system that includes a new sonic device, was created by Clinique scientists working closely with the brand's guiding dermatologist and is rooted in the brand's skin care authority. Clinique has more than 15,000 consultants around the world, and they are excited about selling the new system and educating consumer about its unique benefits. Este\u00e9 Lauder, meanwhile, is launching a new skin care product line in a big Asian white space. Nutritious Rosy Prism incorporates proprietary technology to address skin discoloration that can be caused by aging and environmental pollution. These are just a few highlights of our outstanding creativity. Our innovation pipeline is strong and sustainable, and many other brands have exciting new products and services on the horizon. With regard to our distribution, we sell our products in more than 10 channels, including salons, specialty multi and freestanding stores. These channels present varying degrees of opportunities worldwide for many of our brands. One of our highest growth channel is our travel retail business, where we are the clear global leader in skin care and makeup, the fastest-growing beauty areas in the channel. We have gained share in these areas in recent years and still see many avenues of growth, including more brands, more airports and greater conversion of travelers into buyers. Another winning channel for us continues to be our e-commerce business, which, again, grew double digits. We have been launching brand size in several of our emerging markets and keeping ahead of consumer shopping patterns by continuing to grow our mobile platforms. We also have other opportunities to eliminate known added-value costs, and we will have greater visibility into area of saving and efficiencies once SAP is fully deployed. Tracey will provide more detail on these areas in a few minutes. With just 2 months left in fiscal 2014, we expect to achieve our goals of 6% to 7% local currency sales growth for the full year. Based on results to date and our confidence in the future, we are raising our earnings per share estimates to $2.86 to $2.90 before charges. These estimates exclude the impact of our next SAP go-live shift, which Tracey will also address. We will provide guidance for fiscal 2015 during our year-end call in August. At that time, we will also update our operating margin goals for the next 3 years. I'm pleased to report that we are progressing faster than expected toward our current target of a 16.5% operating margin by the end of fiscal year '16. Now I will turn the call over to Cedric, who will discuss our international business. Cedric Prouv\u00e9 : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I just celebrated 20 years with the company, and I've had the pleasure of leading the international expansion of our unique portfolio brands for the last 12 years. Our mission is to leverage our experienced network of international affiliates and distributors to strategically roll out our brand across the world and nurture their growth. At the same time, we're maintaining great financial discipline, generating productivity improvement and building strong capabilities for the future. Among these, we are investing in retail stores, consumer insights, digital, store design and visual merchandising at the regional and the local level. Our regional efforts align with our overall corporate strategy priorities while integrating key characteristics of our diverse geography. We are proud, again, of our progression this year, marked by significant share gains in all regions and in travel retail. International comprises over 60% of global sales and profits for the company, a percentage that is expected to grow as we expand around the globe. In the past 5 years, our international sales have increased over 10% annually, on average, in constant currency, equaling approximately $2.5 billion of incremental sales. There are 3 central themes that I will expand on in my commentary : one, developed markets are improving; two, turnaround markets are stabilizing; and three, emerging markets are growing. Developed markets represent the majority of our business, and it continued to grow. Several areas have been economically challenged in the recent years, notably Western Europe and Japan. Encouragingly, we're seeing improvement across these economies in our business. In the third quarter, we grew share in Europe, where Germany had an excellent quarter and France, Italy and Spain all posted net sales growth, as well as retail growth ahead of prestige cosmetics. Two key strategies for growth have been the diversification of our channel mix in the region and the accelerated growth of our more selective brands. Our channel mix has evolved ahead of our objectives for fiscal '14, allowing us to generate nearly 20% of our sales directly to consumer through our own retail stores and online, up from 15% in fiscal '13. Consequently, we have gained share in prestige beauty in developed Western European market this year, with growth at 2.8% compared to prestige beauty declining by 1.4%, or a gain of 50 basis points in share. Our U.K. business continued to perform strongly. For the third quarter, our retail sales grew over 12%, continuing the solid improvement we've seen all year. This is even more impressive when you consider that The Este\u00e9 Lauder Companies is the top-ranked corporation in prestige beauty in the U.K., with share over 25%, led by Clinique as the #1 prestige brand. Our strategy in the U.K. and Ireland is to leverage our very balanced portfolio and to treat these countries as emerging markets. For example, we are pursuing new opportunities for our brands within this diversified consumer base in underserved neighborhoods in big and mid-tier cities where there is room for further penetration and locally relevant products and communications. In Japan, we experienced strong retail growth this past quarter, as expected, in anticipation of a 3 percentage point increase in local VAT effective April 1. We are already experiencing encouraging trends this fiscal year, with retail growth of about 4% through December. We anticipate that some of the VAT effect will reverse in Q4, but we expect mid-single-digit retail sales growth in Japan for the full fiscal year. Our strategies for Japan have been based on improved consumer insights and locally relevant innovation, laying the groundwork for continued growth. Fabrizio mentioned the success of our recent introductions in the watery lotion category. In fact, we're the leading international company in our distribution in Japan. The second central theme is that turnaround markets are stabilizing. A few markets have been challenged recently, and we are pleased that they are now stabilizing and improving. Both retail and net sales continued to be strong in Russia, a market where we are now more diversified than ever in terms of geography, brands and distribution. We are focused on diversifying our distribution more profitably and with greater stability. We have been expanding our freestanding stores and online businesses while partnering more strategically with our retailers. Despite the general economic slowdown in Russia, we expect to outperform prestige beauty for the first fiscal year -- for the full fiscal year. We continue to monitor the crisis in Ukraine. However, the market is not a large portion of the Russia business, and we have seen very little in the way of impact. The potential risk stems more from the possible escalation of sanctions between the U.S. and Russia. Korea remains challenging, but the decline experienced in the past couple of years has slowed dramatically, and prestige beauty is stabilizing, with retail growth inching upward. Our business in Korea has seen sequential improvement, and for the third quarter, sales were relatively flat. Most of our brands registered growth in Q3, reflecting a greater focus on brand portfolio execution. We continue to recover in Australia, a key market for us. Australia's GDP growth forecast reflects an improved outlook for consumer spending. Our retail performance shows sign of a turnaround, with growth in each quarter this year. Nearly all of our brands grew in the quarter, mainly by strong double digits, and we are capturing share and recording solid growth on a [indiscernible] basis. Australian consumers' affinity with makeup, in particular, has benefited M-A-C, which we expect will finish the year as the leading prestige brand in the country. The third central theme is that emerging markets continue to be a key building block for our international growth. China remains a strategic priority, and Greater China and Chinese consumers are a focus of the entire company. Our business in China continues to be strong, and there is plenty of additional expansion potential mid to long term. While we experienced a slowdown in January and February due to competitive discounting for the Chinese New Year holiday, we recovered nicely in March, and our net sales are currently up 11% year-to-date without playing the promotional game. We expect double-digit growth to continue in this market, where we have very productive doors in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities and continue to expand beyond. We continue to expand geographically in China into new cities. Fiscal year-to-date, our net sales in Tier 3 and 4 cities contributed 11% of brick-and-mortar retail, up from less than 8% in the year earlier, driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. We continue to launch locally relevant products and introduce new brands, as evidenced by the opening of our first Jo Malone store in Beijing 6 weeks ago. We have identified additional brands in our portfolio that could soon enter the market. Online is reshaping China's retail landscape. Our online sales are doubling on a fiscal year-to-date basis via our own brand sites, retailer sites and the incremental contribution of our Tmall initiative. Clinique has been very successful with its online shop on Tmall, becoming the top prestige beauty brand official store. And Est\u00e9e Lauder plans to go live there later this month, followed closely by Origins. Though China remains a strategic imperative, it is not our only emerging market focus. Beyond China, there are more than a dozen markets which we also classify as emerging, and they are receiving varying degrees of investments, depending on the perceived opportunity. Today, these markets' combined sales exceed those of China and are growing double digits. We envisioned that they will increasingly contribute well into our 10-year compass projections. For example, our business continues to grow double digits in Turkey, Russia, Brazil and Mexico, 4 of our more strategically important emerging markets, and we are growing share in each. We have strong growth in South Africa, and we plan -- and we have plans to expand into additional markets on the African continent. Our Middle East business continues to be very exciting, with retail growth in excess of prestige beauty over the past few months. Despite Venezuela, Latin America continues to perform with excellence and delivers faster growth than any of other regions. One way that affluent consumers from emerging markets are introduced to our brands is through the travel channel. Our business in travel retail continues to grow nicely, with retail growth up 9% year-to-date against traffic growth estimated at 5%. While Chinese-driven traffic has been challenged since October, when new tour regulations were implemented, we saw a significant improvement during the Chinese New Year period in January and February, driven mostly by independent travelers. We keep investing in the channel by opening new brands and new doors, updating existing doors and maintaining a leading advertising presence in key airports. Our strength in the APAC region and our ability to grow the emerging traveling consumer segment have led to our growth and considerable share gains in prestige skin care and makeup in the past 5 years. We are now the clear market leader in these categories and continue to add distance between us and our competitors. We continue to implement our winning strategies by building new capabilities specific to the channel. As a key component to our SMI wave 4, the travel retail team is finalizing preparations for the July go-live. We are confident the implementation of SAP in the channel will go smoothly and that we will be able to leverage it to improve our profitability through efficiency gains and value creation. The outlook for travel retail remains positive. International passenger traffic is expected to rise mid-single digit for the remainder of 2014. We are well positioned to capitalize on this growth and further expand our brands in this most dynamic channel. Our online business continues to grow in importance. This quarter, we launched 9 e-commerce sites around the world, including M-A-C in Brazil, which is exceeding expectations and is already positioned to be one of our top M-A-C doors in the coming year. We also launched 13 new m-commerce sites, including 3 in China for Clinique, La Mer and Origins. In closing, I would like to stress that we are very confident about the future sustainability of the international contributions to the company's top and bottom line growth. Our strategic focus on fostering better consumer insights, leveraging innovation, expanding our geographic presence, rolling out our brand portfolio, diversifying our channels and building new capabilities for success is working well. Our continued ability to expand our international business and grow share speaks volumes about the strength of our brand -- brands, the strategic diversification of our market portfolio and our ability to collectively reach and touch consumers around the world. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis : Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our third quarter financial performance and then share our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '14. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the year-over-year impact of restructuring and other charges, primarily the Venezuela remeasurement charges on this morning's press release. Reported net sales for the third quarter rose 11% to $2.55 billion, above the top end of our expectations. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales grew 12%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share each rose 42% to $251.7 million and $0.64, respectively. EPS was also above the top end of our expectations due to both the sales performance and greater efficiency from our marketing investments. Our third quarter sales growth was affected by the prior year acceleration of retailer orders into our second quarter that otherwise would have occurred in our third quarter related to the January 2013 rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift in the prior year quarter was $94 million in sales and $78 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.13 per share. Excluding the impact of the SMI-related order shift and restructuring and other charges, local currency sales would have grown 8% for the quarter and EPS would have grown 10%. As I walk you through the highlights of our third quarter results, my commentary will exclude the impact of the SMI shift in the prior year's quarter, as well as other charges to facilitate easier comparison of our business performance. Looking at our sales growth by region. Net sales in our Americas region increased 7% in local currency, with 6% growth in North America and 13% growth in Latin America. Regarding softer retail sales, as Fabrizio indicated, a combination of challenging weather, a shift in gift timing for Clinique to the fourth quarter at a major retailer and anniversary-ing the 53rd week from last year along with Easter all contributed to retail performance. The strongest channel performance in North America came from specialty multi-brand stores and online, while department stores and our freestanding stores were more reflective of the softer retail environment. Latin American growth came primarily from double-digit increases in Brazil and Mexico, which saw strong growth at retail and the launch of M-A-C's e-commerce site in Brazil. These gains were partially offset by price reductions in Venezuela, mandated by the new margin cap law enacted at the end of January. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, sales increased a strong 10% in local currency. Regional growth was led by a double-digit increase in the U.K. and 7% growth in travel retail. We also achieved double-digit growth in emerging markets such as Turkey, Russia and Eastern Europe. Our markets in Western Europe were up across the board, with particular strength in Germany, Switzerland and Italy. France rose low single digits, and we saw encouraging growth in both Spain and in Greece. Our sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 6% in local currency. Japan led growth in the region, with high-teens growth largely driven by consumers who bought ahead of the April VAT increase. Taiwan, Australia and Singapore also experienced strong growth. Sales in China rose low single digits for the quarter, reflecting a like-door decline of 7% and due to the increased promotional environment and growth in both online and offshore consumer shopping, as Cedric mentioned in his remarks. We added distribution in 5 doors and 1 new city in China this quarter. Korea continues to stabilize, with sales declining less than 1%. Our gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 80.4%, which primarily reflected both a mix impact, as well as some promotional costs and obsolescence. Operating expense decreased 180 basis points to 65.5% of sales. The major factors contributing to the decrease were flattish marketing costs driving expense leverage of approximately 170 basis points and leverage of general and administrative expenses of 30 basis points, partially offset by higher store operations expenses. Flat marketing dollars in the quarter reflect both a rebalancing by quarter to match brand initiatives and greater support behind brands with primarily in-store, digital and print marketing models such as our makeup artist brands. Operating income rose 18% to $380.1 million, and operating margin increased 140 basis points to 14.9%. Our effective tax rate on the adjusted earnings I just discussed was 31.4%. In our third quarter, we reported a remeasurement loss of $38.3 million related to changes in exchange rate regulations in Venezuela that occurred during the quarter. The Venezuelan government approved a new currency exchange rate mechanism, SICAD II, for access by companies operating in a broader group of industry sectors than previous rates had been recently. Our net monetary assets were converted from the previous official rate of VEF 6.3 to the new SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 49.81 per dollar as of March 31, resulting in the charge reflected in the quarter. Prior to the charge, Venezuela represented less than 1% of our year-to-date sales and less than 2% of our operating income. For the 9 months, cash flow from operating activities rose 25% to $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting improvements in accounts payable and accounts receivable. Inventory days to sell rose to 191 compared with 165 days last year. Higher inventory was mainly due to anticipated sales growth, increased safety stock to maintain appropriate service levels and the anticipation of accelerated orders into the fourth quarter related to the rollout of SMI. For the 9 months, we have also invested $343 million in capital projects primarily to support new counters, technology and retail stores. We repurchased approximately 9 million shares of our stock for $600 million and used $225 million of cash to pay quarterly dividends to stockholders. Our share repurchase program is open-ended, allowing us to buy back shares opportunistically. The acceleration in share buybacks in the third quarter reflected this policy, and we plan to continue this strategy when we have excess cash available in the U.S. As you know, a significant portion of our cash is offshore. That said, in the past couple of years, we have used 100% of our available cash to return to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Let's now turn to our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We expect fiscal 2014 sales to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency, in line with the growth we have experienced year-to-date. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of 1.36 for the euro, 1.62 for the pound and 1.01 for the yen. The combined benefits of gross margin expansion and operating leverage are expected to improve operating margin by 60 to 70 basis points for the full year. Marketing expenditures are expected to increase approximately 3%, and other SG&A costs are expected to leverage. Our continued cost management programs enable us to continue investing in long-term growth drivers like innovation, retail stores, e-commerce and information systems that support our company's future while reducing non-value-added costs. Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is planned at approximately 31%. I'm pleased to say that we are raising our forecast for full year EPS to a range of $2.86 to $2.90 before the Venezuela remeasurement charge and the effect of the accelerated sales orders ahead our SMI go-live in July. Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movements, the approximately 1 percentage point negative currency impact on our top line equates to about $0.02 of EPS. The next wave of our SMI rollout is scheduled for July 2014 and will include our North American order-to-cash process, our travel retail business, Japan and the Middle East. As has been the case in previous rollouts, retailers are expected to increase their orders in advance of the go-live to mitigate any potential disruptions from the transition. The impact will be to shift sales and profits into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year from our fiscal '15 first quarter and full year. We estimate the shift in sales to be between $125 million and $150 million, equal to EPS of approximately $0.14 to $0.17. This amount is higher than previous waves due both to the relative size of the businesses affected and to the higher expected sales in July compared to the timing of previous shifts, which have reflected seasonally slower periods in January. Therefore, including the shift, our sales growth for the year is expected to be between 6% and 7%, and EPS is forecasted at $3 to $3.70 -- $3.07. With the July rollout, we will have completed our final major wave of SMI and will have more than 90% of our sales SAP-enabled. We are excited about the opportunity to leverage the new systems and processes for further operational efficiencies and value creation. We expect to see some of these greater efficiencies in our cost-saving programs in the areas of indirect procurement, improved inventory management with reduced levels and handling costs, productivity and cost of goods. We also continue to make progress on our marketing effectiveness initiatives. In closing, we are very proud of the results we have achieved thus far this year. And on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous dedication and hard work. And that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I guess one sort of housekeeping question and one other question. So China, could you maybe just give us a bit of your thoughts on what the category growth looks like and sort of try to put the slowdown in retail sales and in your same-store sales in terms of the context around category? And then, Cedric, sort of broadly speaking longer term, how do you think about the percentage of sales that you see coming from this company from developing markets over the next few years? And what do you think the number is, as we sit here today, inclusive of the percentage of sales that you got from travel retail that comes from developing markets? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. That's not one question. So I'll answer first the category, while Cedric will answer the rest. So we -- overall, the prestige industry, we see it growing 3% to 4%. And in the previous year, it's been growing at 4% to 5%, so this is a softer year of growth for global prestige beauty. This is driven by -- continue to be driven by demographic, middle class, aging population. But the softness versus previous year in big markets, particularly in China and U.S., is what, at this point in time, is keeping the category around 3% to 4%. Between categories within prestige beauty, we continue to see skin care as a strong, growing category. But this year, we see a special acceleration globally of the makeup category that become more and more important over time as a promising category within prestige beauty. Now Cedric, do you want to address the international part? Cedric Prouv\u00e9 : Yes, so if I understood the question, you're asking how we think the emerging market mix is going to evolve in the future. We have a pretty robust process where we have established a framework for all of our '13, '14 emerging markets, looking at them through 2022. I don't have the exact number in mind, but what I would tell you is that with the CAGR that we are experiencing with these emerging markets, we expect that we would probably double their size in the next 4, 5 years. And I think you asked a question about travel retail. Travel retail fundamentals remain very strong. And as we see these emerging populations accessing to travel and we are really growing in key populations that are going to travel increasingly, whether it's the Chinese or the Russians or Middle East or Turkey or Brazilians, so we are seeing an impact not only in the market but, of course, the destination. We think we also have a project on travel retail that would take us to doubling the sales. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I guess, Tracey, I know you've talked before about the ability to access working capital opportunities, particularly inventory days that you'd need, the final wave of SAP to be up and going. So I guess the question is, with it likely to be 90%-plus done following this next wave, can you access working capital opportunities for this coming holiday season, or do you think it's more of a '15, '16 holiday season opportunity? And if so, just any preliminary thoughts on what you'd do with that cash as it starts to come through would be great. Tracey Thomas Travis : Great question. So yes, I mean, clearly, the buildup that we saw in this quarter was to support that last major wave of SMI. And certainly, the higher levels that we've carried over the last couple of years have somewhat been driven by the rollout of SMI. So we expect inventory levels to start to steadily come down in fiscal '15, which will certainly free up more cash for us. As I said in my prepared remarks, as we look at our free cash flow, we'd look at the mix of distribution to shareholders that is excess -- outside of any acquisitions that we might be planning to do to redistribute. And that certainly will be what we do in the coming months when we believe we will have even more free cash flow available. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I want to talk a little bit about the marketing efficiency in the quarter. What drove that? How is it -- is it sustainable as you look at it? Is that one of the reasons why you feel like you've got more confidence in the margin targets? And then there has been some chatter about sort of gift-with-purchase being maybe a little less efficient right now. Are you seeing any of that in the market? So that issue specifically as well. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. On marketing, I'll -- so yes, there is more efficiency that we are making, and there are several things driving the efficiency. First of all, we have an internal project, which is adjusting our investment measured with greater return on these investments. So for example, we are adjusting down some of our television advertising activities and up other areas like digital and in-store and print as a result of some of these learnings that we had across initiatives. So this is about increasing rate of return on every single penny we spend. Second, the overall percent that you save on marketing can be impacted by the kind of innovation we have. For example, if we launch a big innovation in skin care on our big brands like Lauder or Clinique, this tends to be carrying more advertising investment than some of our makeup artist brands. So the mix between innovation across brands has an impact. Second, the mix by country has an impact. There are some countries which are more advertising-driven such as U.S. and other countries which are less advertising-driven such as some of the emerging markets. So overall, given the mix evolution of our business, given our rate of return improvements, we are confident that we can leverage our marketing expenses, still continue to spend more against our key opportunity and initiatives. In terms of gift-with-purchase, yes, we see the gift-with-purchase being less efficient than what it used to be in the past. That's why we are evolving and learning how to adjust our promotional strategy and how also, frankly, to improve the existing gift-with-purchase activity to make them more efficient for the future and more effective. Tracey, I don't know if you want to add something. Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes, the only thing I'll add to that is that for the full year, we expect our marketing expense as a percent of sales to be slightly leveraged, so you won't see 170 basis points every quarter. But to Fabrizio's point, it does depend on the brand launch activity and the brand support activity, obviously, but we do expect to see a slight leverage this year, full year. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just following up on the advertising and the spending support, it sounds like over time, natural progression, more emerging markets, more makeup artist brands and more of the luxury brands, that there's a natural pull for the advertising to come down. So can you help us understand what -- help quantify what that kind of change is relative to what you can leverage in terms of just being more efficient? Fabrizio Freda : No. Frankly, I think it's very difficult to quantify because this will depend -- that's exactly what we are doing. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are trying to adjust our business, reflecting the opportunity around the world to being flexible to respond to the various opportunity as they evolve. So it's very difficult to give you details at such level of complex mix element that we have around the world. But internal overall trend, you're right. That's exactly the point we are making. There is a leverage opportunity over time. And the way we are programming our strategy, basically, we call it compass, the way we are working our 5-, 10-year vision and compass of our mix of countries, channels, brands is designed to leverage, to leverage our gross margin, to leverage our marketing expenses to become, over time -- and to go in the right direction. However, you need to also assume that this change of model also bring new costs in some other aspect and areas of the P&L. For example, freestanding stores bring some other area of cost. And importantly, the mix -- the more we grow skin care globally, the more we can leverage all these aspects in our P&L. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Fabrizio, looking ahead, and I think you alluded to this in your prepared remarks and maybe in response to Chris's question, Tracey, earlier, but just given where the business is heading this fiscal year based on your guidance, should we expect you to revisit some of your longer-term goals alongside fiscal '15 guidance in a few months, whether with respect to the longer-term margin targets, working capital, the capital structure, cash deployment priorities in general. Because I think beyond your ability to continue to grow and expand share amidst all of the competitive and macro challenges, just getting more clarity and confidence in what Est\u00e9e Lauder thinks it can do longer term in terms of profitability and free cash flow generation is probably one of the highest-order questions for investors. So just curious on how you're thinking about those items or at least a communication of them going forward. Fabrizio Freda : So actually, yes, I have talked about that in my prepared remarks. And so we are progressing faster than what we expected toward our 16.5% margin for 16% previous goal. And so we expect to revise this goal in the August call, as we do every year. And so you will get, at that point, a new plan for the future. We continue to believe that we have the ability to grow 0.5 margin point per year in the several future years, and that's what we are working on. To do that, we will need to continue growing our business, to continue leveraging our business and importantly, as Tracey has explained in her remarks, to start using the SAP and the SMI project to creating value and to -- because we will have visibility on new value-added cost elimination opportunities. Tracey, you want to add something? Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes. And the only thing I will add to that is one of the things that has worked incredibly well for us over the last few years is the opportunity to both identify and deliver cost savings, as well as invest for the future. So much of what we are experiencing this year is related to investments that we have made in previous years to set up some of our midterm brands for more success, as an example. And we would expect to continue to do that over the next few years. Certainly, SMI gives us a new tool to leverage cost savings, where -- versus some of the prior programs that we have. So we are, as I said in my prepared remarks, quite excited about moving forward in this next journey. We will update all of our goals in the August call. That will be margin, sales, as well as working capital. And as the board authorizes capital structure, we'll update those goals as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Quick housekeeping question for Tracey. Could you just remind us the size and scope of your e-commerce business and kind of maybe whatever the high-level path of expansion you see for that channel? And then for Cedric, specifically, strategically, mobile commerce seems to be at a much faster adoption rate for your international consumers versus your U.S. consumers based on the work that we do. So as you look at your growth in digital for international, is it really, for you, more about sites, SKUs and brands available on those sites, or is it about key functionalities tied to payment that's going to drive conversion even further? Tracey Thomas Travis : So on your first question, our e-commerce business is approximately 6% of our total business. There are some markets that are more highly concentrated than others, so the U.S. and the U.K. have more developed e-commerce businesses, e-, m-commerce businesses. And in those markets, the percent of sales are about 10%. And again, that includes both our sites, as well as our customer retailer sites. We are and have seen terrific growth in various markets of the e-commerce business. And certainly, Cedric talked about China, and I'll let him expand on the second part of your question in a moment. And we invest where we see high adoption in terms of e- and m-commerce and where we see -- where we have a brand presence as well so that we can leverage both in-store visibility and consumer availability, as well as e- and m-commerce visibility. Cedric Prouv\u00e9 : Yes, so this is a big topic for international, but of course, we are very focused on the rollout of our sites around the world. You know the prospective now, it's 6% for total company. In some of our international markets, we are passing 10%, like the U.K. And in some of the emerging markets, we are, of course, in the very early stages of development. In terms of the sites, it's important for us to develop the sites. We have our own sites, and we have retailer sites. In general, what we see is that retailer sites tend to grow a little bit faster, so we have a program to actually help our retail partners developing their online business as well, because initially, there's always a little bit of reluctance and protection of their brick-and-mortar business. What we see that's very important is the future of omni-channel, where actually, we need to integrate online and offline and we get much better consumer efficiency. Fabrizio Freda : And the last part of your question was m-commerce. So our m-commerce in the quarter was just doubling versus last year. So you're right. The growth of m is really, really strong. Cedric Prouv\u00e9 : Much faster. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : The organic sales growth in the quarter at 8%, how much do the early buying in Japan contribute to that? And a related question is that early buying clearly helped the quarter, but you were hurt by the promotional activity in China and in the U.S. by Easter, the weather and the Clinique shift. So if we put all those things together, were you may be up 8% adjusted for those gives and takes? Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes, I would say with those gives and takes, we were up -- we were still up around 8%. So Japan, again, is a large market for us but in the whole scheme of things, from a total company standpoint, would not significantly impact our results -- our segment results, yes, not our total company results for the quarter. Fabrizio Freda : Your 3 observations are correct. There has been some element of stocking these 3 things, but they are not significant numbers. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Sean King - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is Sean King in for Jason English. I guess the question that I have is if you could speak a little bit more about what you're seeing in U.S. department stores and what your expectation is for, I guess, the rest of the year given the weakness that we saw in the first quarter. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, we saw a weak first quarter, as we explained, for several reasons, like weather, Easter and the 53rd week, et cetera. So what we see, we believe that we would see some recovery of the trend in the U.S. overall in the market. We are confident that the U.S. market has the potential to continue growing in the mid-single digits for the long term and to continue growing faster than mass. Within that, the mid-tier department stores are going to be the critical issue in terms of acceleration because, as you know, the rest of online, specialty, freestanding stores are, today, having strongest trend than mid-tier department stores. But mid-tier department store acceleration is going to be supported by our innovation in the next 12 months, which is going to be strengthened, to be innovation, which is less cannibalizing. We call it white space innovation. It should bring new consumer and accelerate the trend again, particularly in the skin care area. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : First, I just want a clarification on the 6% to 7% top line growth because until last quarter, that used to be excluding the SMI shift. And I'm trying to understand why now, it includes it, if I heard it correctly, particularly given the better number that you have from the top line for this quarter. And then the non-clarification question, although I would like some clarification about it, is the skin care rebound looks pretty good at about 7%. And a lot of it sounds like it was from innovations, which didn't really materialize last quarter. And I'm trying to understand -- I mean, cannibalization was a big theme last quarter for some of these innovations. I'm trying to understand why it's a little bit different this time, what went wrong last time, perhaps, what's getting better here. And if you can rope in as well the context of the fact you're only spending 1% of your sales on R&D versus some of your competitors spending much, much more, as well as the fact that the margins in skin care look like they were down, that's why the operating income only grew 2%. Tracey Thomas Travis : Okay, let me [indiscernible] for that question, Ali. In terms of the 6% to 7%, and again, we quoted a lot of numbers on the call with all of the moving parts, so I can understand some of the confusion. And I think the press release does a good job of laying it out when you can refer to it. The 6% to 7% for the full year still does exclude the SMI shift. And obviously, we introduced the new SMI shift for the fourth quarter, but it also excludes that, so that is an SMI-adjusted number of 6% to 7%. What we spoke about was the $125 million to $150 million of advanced shipments we'll see in our fourth quarter are worth about $0.14 to $0.17 of EPS growth for the year, but that is including the next SMI shift. But the 6% to 7% is clean of SMI. Fabrizio Freda : So no change versus our previous 6% to 7%, so basically, we are not changing our full year 6% to 7% x SMI. And in terms of the skin care, so you're right, the skin care had a softer quarter in October, December, and now there is an acceleration. The difference is the kind of innovation that we have in this part of the fiscal year is less cannibalizing. It's more white space. That's why in my prepared remarks, I spoke a lot about that exactly to make this point because I understood there was some confusion. Our innovation going forward will be a good balance between revitalizing our historical SKUs, like Advanced Night Repair on Lauder, and then adding on top non-cannibalizing innovation that enter white space and creates more net extra and then bringing in some of our brands into areas they are not, which is again, non-cannibalizing. So what you see in skin care is not necessarily more innovation in total, but you see that kind of innovation is driving faster growth. And I believe this will continue in the next 12 months, for example, with the innovation I have explained on Clinique in the course of my prepared remarks. Then in terms of the -- what was the third question? Dennis D'Andrea: R&D, 1%. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, R&D 1% is -- we actually invest the majority of our R&D activity in skin care. So if you calculate the percent of your investment on the skin care sales, this is actually a higher number. That's one point. And then it's not necessarily apples-with-apples because we have other activities that support our innovation. And last, we -- our innovation program is based a lot in connect and develop with other groups, meaning with the suppliers, with university, with other experts. So we leverage capabilities which are outside of the company with our R&D program in a very profound way. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I just have really quick questions. Number one, can you give us the like-door growth for China, whatever would be consistent with the minus 4% you gave us last quarter? And then, Tracey, on SMI, I know you've talked about how the first sort of aspect of the cost savings is just going to be turning off some of the legacy systems that you've been running sort of in duplicate as you've been in the process of rolling out SAP. So can you quantify for us -- forget about above and beyond, process changes and real benefits from SMI and SAP, but just the turning off of that old system, when is that going to start, and how much is that going to equate to in terms of the benefit to margins? Tracey Thomas Travis : Okay. So for China, Wendy, the comp or the same-store sales growth in the quarter was minus 7%. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the total growth was low single digits, but the comp door sales growth was minus 7%. In terms of SMI and thinking about next year, so we go live in January. We have our normal hyper care period for 3 months, so the team remains in place in order to support that activity. And then we can begin the process of decommissioning legacy systems. From a cost standpoint, I think we'll be able to update more holistically in August some of that activity. There is some savings, though, related to your point of the decommissioning of those systems. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division : This is Brian Doyle in for Caroline. Just on the U.S. business, we were wondering if there was some shipping of new products maybe ahead of sell-through. The mid-single-digit growth in revenue was ahead of retail data that we've seen, which looked quite a lot weaker. I know you had e-commerce, and owned stores did better, but if you could just help us out on that. And then secondly, I don't know if you actually commented on what you saw in terms of market share trend both in China and the U.S. in the quarter. Tracey Thomas Travis : So on the shipments, you're correct. We did ship product in the U.S., particularly in the March time frame, to support some April activity. We talked about the Clinique gift that shifted into the fourth quarter from the third quarter, as well as some other activity as well. So that's why you see the disconnect in the third quarter. And that's why we spoke about retail softness, although the numbers from a net standpoint didn't necessarily reflect that. Fabrizio Freda : So what's the second question? Dennis D'Andrea: Market share in U.S -- market share in U.S and China. Fabrizio Freda : So the question on the U.S. market share is -- the answer, sorry, on the U.S. market share, we are, by far, the leader in the U.S. We're more than double the second competitor and around 39% overall share. When you look at our quarter and our year, we are doing a very solid results in makeup. Also, please keep in mind that the retail numbers you see is only 60% of our business. The rest is not covered like freestanding store, online, et cetera. So the makeup, very solid. We are growing market share in fragrance and in hair care. We are growing faster than the market online in specialty, our luxury brands. So the specific issue in the U.S. market share is skin care in mid-tier department stores, and we need to address this issue with the non-cannibalizing skin care innovation that we have been describing the course of this call, in our prepared remarks. That's exactly our plan. That's exactly the area of focus that -- the area of softness that we will address with skin care innovation in the next 12 months to go back growing also skin care market share within prestige in the U.S. Cedric Prouv\u00e9 : And for China, we are the #1 group and we're the #1 brand. But we have stable market share for the year-to-date, and we lost a little bit of market share in the quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: First, a clarification on what you mentioned in Japan. Could you remind us what percentage of sales the company has in Japan and what was the actual growth of Japan in the third quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the second quarter? That will be the clarification because I didn't understand what you said with the prior question. And then more -- the real question has to do with China. The slowdown continued. What do you attribute this slowdown? Because we had seen a pickup of herbal and South Korean brands in our survey work. And how that dovetails into your strategy of opening stores in China at a time that there seems to be a slowdown, what does it mean for margins to the extent that those points of distribution may not be having the kind of throughput that you may want to have? Fabrizio Freda : So I want first to address the China thing, and then we -- the Japan numbers. China, actually, it continued to be a very strong market. I want to clarify that slowdown means that it's gone from double-digit growth in the market to single-digit growth in the market but still remains one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Second point is China, the decline -- or the stabilization or market growth in Tier 1 city of China is what is seen in the number. Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities continued to grow. China online business continued to grow, and China freestanding store and specialty channels continued to grow nicely. So the last point is on your issue of productivity. China is still, today, the, by far, most productive market per door. Just a number -- our doors in China are 5x more productive on average than our doors in the U.S. So a certain decrease on sales per door is to be expected with a strong increase in distribution that is happening and the fact that internal travelers, which are 350 million, now find the product in their city of origins, thanks to online and increased distribution in Tier 2 and Tier 3. So the decline of same-door sales in China is expected and, by the way, will not impact profitability for many years to go because, as I said, it's the most productive market per door of the world as we speak. And the other... Tracey Thomas Travis : So on Japan, Javier, both Cedric and I spoke about Japan. It's about 4% of our total sales. The market has been performing strongly this year up until, certainly, the third quarter, where obviously, the sales growth accelerated. So even prior to the VAT increase, Japan had been up mid-single digits. In the third quarter, Japan was up high double digits, and that is in advance of, obviously, the April VAT increase, where the VAT went from 5% to 8%. So Cedric spoke about a little bit of softness post VAT in the April time frame, but we would expect that Japan would recover to that mid-single-digit level based on some of the strong programs that we have in the market right now with Clinique and others. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Sort of long, convoluted question, but part of the issue in the U.S., could it be -- I know a huge source of growth has been taking brands -- taking share away from some of the mass market brands. And one of your competitors said there's no such thing as affordable luxury, meaning that we're going to focus our business almost exclusively on luxury products because there's sort of no mid-tier. And I think maybe part of the risk -- you can tell me if you think I'm dead wrong. But the middle-class consumer is massively stretched right now, and you see it in some of the IRI-type data. And so is there a risk with the strategy of pulling people out of mass because that consumer, at least for the time being, is very at risk? Or maybe you think I'm being short-term on this, and over time, obviously, that market comes back. Just love some clarification, if you don't mind. Fabrizio Freda : Frankly, I think it's a great question because it's actually true that in this moment, meaning the last 6, 9 months, has been tougher to move people from mass into prestige than it used to be. In fact, you see also in our portfolio the growth of luxury brands is much stronger than the entry price of prestige brands. And in fact, that's why, again, in our prepared remarks, we are explaining that we are turning our focus more balanced into gaining market share within prestige with the kind of innovation we are launching also and a non-cannibalizing one. That, however, is, as you say, a short-term point, meaning that's what is the right to do in this moment. I believe, frankly, that in the long term, the sourcing from mass strategy will continue to be the way to grow the category in prestige, that the middle-class growth will fuel the prestige market. Now in the U.S., this may be slower than in this moment than in other markets, but globally, this is still the clear trend, even today in total. So you're right, but I don't think this is a long-term trend. I think this is just a short-term U.S.-specific adjustment that, in fact, we are doing. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Fabrizio, I was wondering maybe if you can just touch on the -- one of the earlier questions on emerging markets. And as you think about the 10-year compass and doubling the business over the next 5 years, how should we think about the margin profile? Because many consumer companies see margin degradation as they expand more aggressively in emerging markets. So if you can provide any clarity there, that would be really helpful. Fabrizio Freda : No. Actually, as we explained in the last years, in the majority of our emerging markets, we start to build a business in a way which is accretive and not dilutive to the other -- to the company after a certain amount of year of investment, obviously. So the growing level of the profitability in the emerging markets tends to be in line or accretive to the margin, so we don't see an issue of this kind. Also, the expansion of international contains an important share of travel retail and online. And as you know, those will continue to be among the fastest segments in the international growth, and they are very profit-accretive. And finally, within the emerging market, we tend to choose and prioritize the ones which are more accretive and the brands that we use to build emerging markets. Take this is mind in a very important way. So net, I don't believe the expansion of new channel and new emerging market will be a dilutive risk. If anything, it's one of the mix element that, over time, will play in favor of building our profitability. Dennis D'Andrea: Holly, can we wrap up? Operator : Yes.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Demsey, Group President. John will discuss the makeup and luxury categories in the context of his global brand portfolio. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges, including the remeasurement charge related to Venezuela. In addition, we will generally discuss results before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the fourth quarter due to the July implementation of our Strategic Modernization initiative. We will also explain the impact of the shift in sales on our fiscal 2015 first quarter and full year expectations. You can find reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal year 2014 capped five years of our strategy by delivering an excellent financial performance setting new records and transforming our company in many positive ways. I am pleased to be able to celebrate and share these important accomplishments with you. Throughout our winning strategy, we have aligned our organization, created multiple engines of growth, improved our profitability and solidified our leadership in global prestige beauty. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies has many unique attributes that contributed to our achievements including a diverse portfolio of powerful prestige brands, huge global reach, a business that's balanced across category, geographies and channels and superior talent in creativity product quality and innovation. By strengthening our asset pursing the best opportunities and sharpening our execution, we have delivered outstanding results year after year. We believe the foundation we have worked so hard to develop over the last five years set us up for continued success creating desirable product, consumer covered and creating value for our stockholders. We are fortunate to be in an exciting and growing industry that strives on newness and attract millions of new consumes every year. We are confident we can build on our success and continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth that outpaces global prestige beauty even when certain geographies or categories may be challenged. Fiscal year 2014 was highlighted by strong topline growth. Sales increased 7% in local currency to a record $10.8 billion, excluding accelerated orders relating to our recent SMI implementation. These results were in line with our estimates and approximately three points ahead of global prestige beauty growth. All regions and categories contributed to our performance. We successful leveraged our higher sales and created greater efficiencies to boost the bottom line. We grew our sales and profit in the phase of several challenging markets, including slower prestige beauty growth in the U.S. and China and softness in certain other countries including Southern European and Korea. Additionally the competitive environment in global beauty intensified our ability to successfully manage through these headwinds enable us to deliver an impressive performance. By targeting our investment to the most promising opportunities around the world, we achieved record financial results including sales, gross margin, operating margin, EPS and cash flow from operations. We accomplished many of our strategic goals, gained global share in prestige skin care and makeup, due in part to strong innovations. Our two biggest brands Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique each reformulated one of their iconic skin care products with new technologies to deliver greater value to the consumer. We had several strong skincare launches in Asia with watery lotions, a large sub category where we had not previously represented entered with new innovations. In the U.S. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and La Mer products were the top 10 SKUs in prestigious skin care for the fiscal year. Our makeup category was vibrant, lipstick sold especially well across several of our brands as did hybrid products that incorporate makeup and skin care like CC Cr\u00e8me. We maintained our strong leading position in prestige makeup in the U.S. The six best selling makeup SKUs for the year were from M-A-C, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. M-A-C has one of its best years ever and the popularity of this global makeup powerhouse keeps soaring. The brand's highly creative collections and standing visuals are steeped in the latest fashion and culture strengths. M-A-C expanded its global distribution and awareness through those brick and motor stores and grew it's digital audiences significantly. Our fragrance business accelerated its sales growth as planned and we gained share in U.S. prestige led by recent launches such as Est\u00e9e Lauder Modern Muse, the Michael Kors collection and Tory Burch and also importantly our luxury brands. Due to first year investments in some big launches, our profit for the year declined and we expect our profitability in the category to improve going forward, thanks to leveraging successful launches and our more profitable luxury brands growth. Our small and mid size brands were among the fastest growing, especially our luxury brands, which primarily focus on one category of prestige beauty, La Mer for instance, which specializes in luxury skin care, had global success by building it's selective distribution reach, creating incremental usage with new products and attracting new consumers. Turning to our geographies, in China, our sales climbed double-digits and we remained the largest prestige beauty company. We delivered terrific results despite lower beauty industry growth rates. During the year, we entered 12 additional cities, increased our presence in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and launched our Jo Malone brand. In the online space, Est\u00e9e Lauder opened a shop on Tmall, which contributed to our eCommerce business in China more than doubling. We generated strong sales growth in other emerging markets, which represents an important part of our expansion plan. Taken together, these markets, which include for example Middle East, Turkey, Russia are climbing double-digits. In our established markets, our U.K. business was exceptionally strong, led by M-A-C and Jo Malone. We gained share by seeking opportunities in smaller cities and underserved areas in catering to multicultural consumers. We grew our business in the U.S. reflecting new product introduction, while selectively increasing distribution for some of our strongest and fastest growing brands. In terms of channels, we've continued our strong performance in the high growth ones where we are focused. Our online business rose double-digits and travel retail once again posted strong growth far ahead of passenger traffic. Our three largest markets in the travel retail channel are in Asia and each generated double-digit gains. In fiscal '14, we prepared the last major wave of our strategic modernization initiative, which included North America, Japan and travel retail amounting to the largest volume of sales going live at once. We worked closely with our retail partners and suppliers and I am pleased to say our detailed planning and training paid off as large mass implementation has gone smoothly thus far. Today approximately 93% of our sales are SIP enabled and we expect to see greater efficiencies from the new processes in demand in years to come. Our fiscal '14 performance build upon the dramatic progress we made in the past five years. Over that period, our sales grew by $3.5 billion, excluding the accelerated orders in fiscal year '14. This was a compound annual growth rate of 8.1% and twice as fast as global prestige beauty on average. We oriented a company distribution to high growth channels. As a result, our online sales have tripled our travel retail business more than doubled and we have added nearly 220 free standing stores bringing our count to almost an 950 directly owned stores today across the globe. We eliminated more than 800 million of costs, which enabled us to reinvest in business driving activities including substantially increasing advertising. We increased our operating margin by 910 basis points faster than we expected allowing us to raise our long-term operating margin targets. We posted double-digit EPS growth every year. We increased our dividend very sharply and all told, our stockholders saw a total return on investment of 383%. As I noted, this five years period, is a solid foundation for our future growth and underscores the confidence in our strategy. Thus we are updating our long-term operating margin goal to 17.5% in fiscal year 2017 with at least a 50 basis point improvement on average each year. We continue to be guided by our 10-year compass a high level roadmap of expected economic and consumer trends. It helps us position our brands in the largest, fastest growing and most profitable categories, regions and channels, which should enable us to deliver consistent solid growth for years to come. As for the current year, we estimate that global prestige beauty will continue to grow at about 3% to 4%. Our strongest growth is anticipated to again count from our online business and emerging markets across the world where in the aggregate, we expect to post double-digit sales gains. Our results confirm we have strong strategy and we will focus even more on excellent execution and building capabilities while maintaining the flexibility to anticipate and respond to new opportunities and dynamic market conditions. Our outlook for Asia Pacific is bright. We anticipate China will deliver solid growth. Japan meet single-digit improvement will continue and our business in Korea will show sales gains. Our sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are expected to further increase. Certain European countries are expected to improve and others that have been soft are forecasted to stabilize due to our portfolio strategies as well as strengthening economies. The U.S. retail landscape continues to show stronger growth at the high end, which bodes well for our company and particularly our luxury brands. Over the past five years our emerging market sales have more than doubled to explore the next wave of growth we will use our diverse brand portfolio to address varied consumer preferences in different geographies. We will also expand the development of freestanding stores, which are essentially in some countries because of limited distribution opportunities. It is also important we will be casually attuned to our consumer, through our product offering, advertising and services. We have prioritized our emerging markets and there are several that we believe have the best prospects for growth. China our largest emerging market remains the most promising and our brands are positioned to win by taking advantage of the best opportunities there. Our goal is to grow a double-digit compound rate over the next three years by strengthening our largest brand and making them more locally relevant. We also expect to increase the pace of innovation in key subcategories and deepen our penetration in smaller cities. All our other emerging markets taken together are growing double-digit and generate sales growth greater than our China business. Our large heritage markets are essential also to our continued growth. We are number one in prestige beauty in the U.S. and in the U.K. and intend to grow our share profitably by farther optimizing our brand portfolio sourcing consumer from mass and expanding our digital presence. Multi acting consumers are a growing opportunity and we will enhance our efforts to appeal to them. Internal distribution, global department stores remains our core channel and we will concentrate on building traffic on the beauty floor by making our merchandizing and high-touch services more engaging. Our Bobbi Brown brand for example is building traffic by amplifying its free makeup metabolism at its counters and that service has significantly increased the average unit sales per customer. We continue to demonstrate success in higher growth distribution channels as well as we expand in specialty multi across the globe and we match the right brands with the right retailers. Our plans also include continued global expansion of our freestanding store to reach consumers where prestige distribution is limited and in busy locations. M-A-C is piloting several new store formats featuring different designs and sizes. As I mentioned earlier our eCommerce business has grown tremendously as we plan to keep up with exceptional pace. In fiscal 2015, we plan to bring more brands online in several new markets. We are building on the success of Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder on Tmall in China by opening origins there later this year and looking at more brands to follow. We also plan to expand our mobile capabilities. Believing more bi-commerce holds the rate potential in many countries. Our online business grew more than three times the rate of the total company and mobile is the fastest growing component of e-commerce with its sales having doubled last year. M-A-C is our leader in M-commerce. We've enjoyed sharp growth in travel retail and have many initiatives underway to drive further momentum. We are the leader in skin care and makeup categories as well as in Asia and plan to strengthen our position in these areas to capture opportunities in prime travel corridors. As for our product offering skincare sales will be in integral to our growth strategy and we have a number of key innovations from our biggest brands. Clinique recently launched two major products that reinforced its authority in customization and cleansing. One is its mass Smart Custom-Repair Serum that treats different concerns depending on individual skins and the other is Clinique Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush, which works in concert with its three steps cleansing system. Both products started on clinique.com with very positive results and are rolling out globally this quarter. In hair care our brands play in the relatively small but growing prestige niche. Aveda our largest hair care brand expands its rising strength in Asia to continue. It opened its first freestanding store in Korea and Thailand last year and will accelerate its travel retail expansion in Europe and Asia. We intend to increase our R&D investment this year. Our innovation pipeline is robust across our brands and this year is more focused on wide spaced products that will fill intact areas for us. These kinds of product generate incremental net sales because they incur us tryout by both new and existing consumers. We also will continue innovating existing products in core franchises to keep them fresh which drives loyalty for existing consumers. Many of the new innovation will be locally relevant and targeted to the specific consumer segment before possibly rolling out more broadly. To help fewer our company investment across all our business we will leverage our SMI enabled capabilities to achieve greater efficiencies and cost savings. We now have better visibility into vast amounts of data information from our brands and countries that we can analyze and use to improve our operations. During the next phase of growth we will focus on superior execution in all facets of our strategy. I am proud of what we have accomplished over the past five years and excited about our journey still to come. Our brands will be using their amazing creativity to set trends, create the most desirable high quality beauty products and size opportunity evident in our compass as well as others we can even imagine now. It\u2019s a winning formula that we believe will enable us to deliver sustainable consistent growth throughout our strategy. In fiscal 2015, we expect growth to come from many different engines together producing healthy constant currency sales gains of 6% to 7% and double-digit increases in EPS. Tracey will provide more details on our financial outlook. Our company has made terrific progress and I thank all of our employees for this fantastic achievement. Their passion and excellence has resulted in another year of outstanding growth and creativity and helped build a strong winning foundation for our future. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John. John Demsey : Thank you, Fabrizio. I\u2019m glad to be here today to share some details about our portfolio and our forward looking strategies. I am going to focus primarily on the growing makeup category and our luxury business. I joined the company 23 years ago with the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand and helped build the M-A-C brand. Now as Group President I oversee nine brands some of which include Est\u00e9e Lauder, M-A-C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Tom Ford Beauty and Smashbox. One of the core strength of the Est\u00e9e Lauder companies is our large and diverse portfolio. We have more than 25 prestige brands in four major beauty categories across a range of price points and position to appeal to a multitude of consumers. Our channel, geography and category diversity lets us dial up and dial down what we are investing and seeking opportunities. Our broad range allows us to react quickly and optimize our brands to focus where the industry is growing and navigate where there may be weakness. Makeup is a key growth driver for us. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company is the global leader in prestige makeup and the category is the second largest and fast growing one for the company. In the United States the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company share in prestige makeup is over 45%. We have the top two brands M-A-C and Clinique and the last 10 of the top 20 prestige makeup launches in the United States were from our brands. We are outpacing industry growth and global prestige makeup, which is expected to be the fastest growing category in many markets. We are well positioned in this category since it plays to our competitive advantage, creativity and innovation. Within face we leverage much of our skin care technology to create high performance foundations. In color we are able to leverage our extensive color library within the unique formulas of each of our brands. This is the area where we use our creativity the best, tapping into makeup artist to create collections and products that surprise and delight the consumer. We also have great reach from entry to largely price points. Our makeup brand span the spectrum in terms of pricing and target consumers. Let me tell you about some of the brands that are driving our makeup success. Our makeup focus brands are expected to grow by double-digits this year through a combination of strong organic growth and increase selective distribution. M-A-C one of our powerhouse brands is our best known and largest makeup brand. Its democratic pricing and all ages, all races, all sexes appeal literally to everyone. To give a quick fact on average in fiscal '14, M-A-C sold four products every second. M-A-C has thousands of makeup artists globally and supported more than 425 shows during fashion weeks in New York, London, Malone and Paris. M-A-C has grown from its strong North American roots and has diversified geographically. In fiscal '14 M-A-C\u2019s international sales again surpassed those from its North American business. We opened M-A-C doors in six new countries for distribution in total of 94 countries and even as we are expanding M-A-C, we were generating strong comp door growth at the same time. Department stores continue to account for the majority of M-A-C\u2019s business drawing multigenerational consumers. M-A-C had great success at Nordstrom where it's has been the best selling beauty brand for many years and also at Macy's where it recently became the number three beauty brand behind Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder, which is an amazing accomplishment given the fact that it has only sold less than half of the Macy's doors. M-A-C\u2019s freestanding stores are also a key distribution strategy and act as a great venue for learning and experimentation, which lets us apply their success to other channels. M-A-C is our top brand in terms of the number of retail stores and we added almost 60 of them last year. These stores full represent the philosophy and positioning of the brand globally and showcase our amazing creativity. M-A-C also expanded its digital audience through successful social media channels. It became the largest beauty brand on Instagram and increased its Facebook fans by 25% in fiscal 2014. In addition every week M-A-C launches successful fashion and pop culture collaborations that bring consumers to its counters and stores and online. This year will be no different with collections as varied as pop culture favorite Mark Simpson from the Simpson\u2019s to Brooke Shields. Another of our pure-play beauty makeup brands is Smashbox, which has doubled in sales and profitability since we acquired it four years ago. Smashbox occupies a unique space in the industry with its photo studio positioning. Smashbox resonates well online and with Millennium. The brand won a clear for best digital social campaign and was an honorary for the top two online awards. Smashbox is a perfect fit for the specialty multichannel and remains a clear leader in makeup. It's one of the top three brands and primers and BB and CC creams in North America prestige beauty. This year we plan to continue this trend with exciting launches in contouring, primer and eye shadow. Smashbox also has been opening new international markets during the past two years and there is significant expansion potential to come including strong growth in the European region. We also have had great strength in makeup within our multi-category brands. Est\u00e9e Lauder is a global three category power house with wide multi-tire distribution and a strong focus on Asia and skincare. This year Est\u00e9e Lauder is leveraging its leading authority in serums by launching Perfectionist Foundation rooted in Perfectionist Serum. We plan to leverage Est\u00e9e Lauder Heritage and Iconic franchises, which are some of the best known in the business. Last year we modernized the pure color franchise with Pure Color Envy Sculpting lipstick, which hydrates with a time release moisture complex and shapes and sculpts lips. This year we will build upon success with Pure Color Envy eye shadows. Clinique is one of our company\u2019s largest brands and the second largest prestige makeup brand in the United States. While it is not part of my portfolio, I could not talk about makeup with our talking about Clinique, allergy testing and fragrance free Clinique occupies a unique position in prestige, which embraces healthy beauty. Clinique is a leader in foundation in the United States because its formulas offer flawless skin instantly and dermatological benefits over time. A philosophy that says, pretty can be easy as to the broad appeal and also Clinique draw consumers of all ages and retain them through product innovations like chubby stick. Chubby sticks make color easy to apply and expand the chubby franchise of eye, lip and cheek to help anchor Clinique\u2019s leadership role in the category in North America and around the world. Our other makeup artist brand Bobbi Brown has a luxury and classical positioning that helps women look like themselves only better, prettier and more confident. The brand has been making great strides in the specialty-multi channel and plans to expand its distribution there over the next several years. Bobbi\u2019s makeup lessons in departmental stores and freestanding stores differentiated as a teaching brand and are a strategic service that drives significant traffic and loyalty. Next year, Bobbi will build upon this service with locally relevant menus by market and makeup lesson videos featuring multi-ethnic models. Bobbi is also rapidly and successfully embraced the digital world. Its eCommerce site in the United States is its number one door worldwide and that it's accreted an outstanding social media results with 72 global digital platforms that are followed by a subscriber base of 4.5 million consumers. The brand has been number one rank branded beauty channel on Youtube with videos that have been viewed globally 10 million times. We\u2019re confident about our continued strength in makeup this year based on our innovation pipeline, planned distribution expansion. We expect to capitalize on strong established markets like North America and the U.K. as well as increasing demand from emerging markets. We expect another key growth driver to be our luxury brands. As the luxury market continues to grow, driven by affluent consumers around the world, sales of our luxury brands La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford has been rising double digits globally for several years. These three luxury brands cut across different product categories are largely in skin care and fragrance. Additionally, Bobbi Brown as I mentioned is our main luxury entry in makeup and has generated double digit growth over the past five years. Tom Ford also offers a Q-rated Super Luke\u2019s makeup collection in limited distribution that is also enjoying rapid growth worldwide. La Mer our luxury skin care brand has doubled its net sales in just four years making it now one of the top five brands within the company\u2019s portfolio, an honest to becoming a billion dollar brand. What\u2019s even more impressive is that La Mer has grown this fast while still in limited distribution maintaining a strategic balance between accessibility and exclusivity. To put its global presence in perspective, La Mer is an about 6% of the doors of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is in and has sold in less than half of the countries where we do business offering ample expansion opportunities. La Mer\u2019s had brilliant success with the moisturizing soft cream, which continues the brand\u2019s strong track record in moisturization. More recent launches include the treatment lotion and the Lifting and Firming mask, which have expanded its success beyond moisturizing products. La Mer continues to focus on the Luxury consumer creating compelling product innovations leveraging the heart of the sea in the surpassed experience in store. Jo Malone has also seen double-digit growth across every channel that it is in, doubling its business in the last three years. It\u2019s success is balanced between heritage sense as well as recent launches such as peony & blush suede in the U.K. its home market where it is the number two women\u2019s fragrance brand and Jo Malone comes with a number one fragrance position in some high end retailers across the globe. We see excellent growth opportunities believing Jo Malone has the potential to become one of the largest and most successful high end fragrance brands in the world. We expect the brand to flourish by strengthening categories beyond sprayed fragrance capitalizing on its lifestyle positioning and leveraging it\u2019s freestanding stores under unique fragrance combining experience. Our Tom Ford brand sets the standard of the luxury for beauty. In fiscal 2014, our sales grew double digits at all regions and profits doubled versus the prior year. Tom Ford continues to tap in to the growing demand for luxury and we expect to continue toward this amazing track record to increase distribution in key luxury revenues strengthening pillar fragrance franchises and expanding its Neroli Portofino collection. We also see a major opportunity to develop Tom Ford\u2019s makeup line in high end luxury retailers around the world. And there are large luxury segments within our brands as well. For example, Mrs Est\u00e9e Lauder was a pioneer in luxury skin care and created Renutra part of her name sake brand. It\u2019s one of the top selling luxury skin care brands by itself in the world and we continue its tradition of harnessing nature\u2019s rarest and most powerful ingredients. Renutra plans to launch a new anti-aging serum in the fall to build upon the luxury consumer\u2019s desire for highly effective and technologically advanced products. We have been nurturing our makeup and luxury brands for several years and now they\u2019re poised for even further growth. One of our company\u2019s greatest strengths is building brands and we\u2019ve strengthened the equity of these small and midsized brands and now even met one of our largest to improve their productivity, profitability and desirability so they\u2019re ready to embark on the exciting stage of their growth. These brands share several important characteristics. They\u2019ve been highly successful in travel retail and still had a great expansion potential. They\u2019re digitally savvy and less dependent of traditional advertising. They expressed their authentic equity through an editorial social media freestanding stores and luxurious counter services. We will continue to partner with department stores to elevate the experience with our brands to keep them fresh while selectively broadening their geographical and categorical reach and potential. We will continue to ensure that our makeup and luxury brands stay relevant to consumers in every region. It is thanks to our affiliates with their deep insights of local taste and effective go to market capabilities that have made our brands and product as successful and desirable in small European towns as they are in Midtown Manhattan. With our strong innovation pipeline and this is an exceptional product quality and creativity at local and global capabilities, we\u2019re confident about the growth plans I've outlined today because they build upon our existing strengths. At the heart of our makeup and luxury are our brands and our brands have always been the strength of our company. The brands I discussed today are at different stages of their development and we\u2019ll nurture them profitably. I want to thank our employees and our regions and affiliates for contributing the success of these brands and our company. We expect our larger brands will continue to grow and some of our mid size brands have the potential to become billion dollar brands over time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas : Thank you, John and good morning everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and full year financial performance and then share with you our expectations for fiscal 2015. Please note that my commentary excludes the year-on-year impact of restructuring and other charges, primarily the Venezuela remeasruement charge we took in the third quarter of this year. Also excluded is the fourth quarter and full year impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that otherwise would have occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to our July rollout of SMI. The final impact of that shift was $178 million in sales and $127 million in operating income equal to approximately $0.21 per share. This amount was larger than the estimate we provided in May primarily due to higher advanced orders from our travel retail customers. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial statements can be found in today\u2019s press release and on our website. I am pleased to report that for the fourth quarter net sales rose 6% to $2.55 billion. Excluding the impact of currency translations sales grew 5%. Net earnings grew sharply and were 81% higher at $175.2 million compared with $96.8 in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $0.45 above the top end of our expectations primarily due to the timing and discipline of expense management. Regarding our regional performance, sales in the Americas increased 4% in local currency with 4% growth in the U.S. and double digit growth in Canada and Latin America. We continue to realize double digit growth in the U.S. through specialty multi-stores, online, our freestanding stores and salons and spas and low single-digit growth in department stores. Latin America, double-digit growth was driven largely by Brazil. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, sales increased 6% in local currency. We achieved double-digit sales gains in most emerging markets including Turkey, the Middle East and South Africa. In the more established markets, continued strong growth in the U.K. and Northern Europe was partially offset by softer results in Spain, Italy and Greece. Our sales in the travel retail channel rose 8% primarily reflecting continued growth in global passenger traffic and the expansion of our brands. Sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 7% in local currency, led by double digit gains in China. Like-door growth in China was flat, which was an improvement from recent quarters. Hong Kong and Singapore contributed solid growth while Korea declined slightly. Our gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 80.4% primarily related to pricing and mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 350 basis points to 70.5%. The primary drivers were lower advertising, merchandizing and sampling of 280 basis points reflecting the planned cadence of marketing increased to earlier in the year as well as impairment charges in the prior year of 70 basis points. Operating income rose 68% to $252.2 million and operating margin increased 360 basis points to 9.9%. Let me now turn to the full fiscal year. We managed to deliver strong full year results while again navigating several macro-challenges as Fabrizio indicated. We achieved these results because of the breadth of our product portfolio, our agility in managing resources to fund the best opportunities and the continued focus on the elements of our multiyear strategy. Net sales rose 6% to $10.8 billion, excluding the effects of currency translation, sales grew 7%. Net earnings grew 11% to $1.16 billion and diluted EPS increased 12% to $2.95. Every region and product category contributed to our sales result again this year with international growth continuing to outpace domestic growth. Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 80.3%. The increase came primarily from positive mix and pricing. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 80 basis points to 64.2%. The decrease was primarily due to leverage in our marketing and advertising costs reflected shifts in our mix of brand sales as John indicated as well as a planned shift of media spending to the first half of the year to support major launch activity. We also continue to benefit from our cost savings initiatives and reinvested a portion of those savings in the business building activities we\u2019ve indicated before. Operating income rose 12% to $1.74 billion and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 16.1%. Net interest expense declined 7% to $50.8 million primarily due to the debt refinancing charge in the prior year and the higher interest income this year. Our effective tax rate for the year was 30.9%. On a reported basis, inventory days to sell rose to 198 compared with 183 days last year primarily to support planned growth, the SMI transition and the expansion of our retail stores. The cash flows generated by operating activities increased 25% to a record $1.54 billion compared to $1.23 billion last year primarily reflecting higher earnings and certain working capital improvements. We invested $510 million in capital projects mainly for counters, retail stores and information systems. We\u2019ve returned approximately 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders consistent with our stockholder actions since fiscal 2012. This included $667 million to repurchase approximately 9.6 million shares of our stock, which was a 72% acceleration in dollars from last year\u2019s share repurchase activity and $302 million in dividends, which reflected an 11% increase in the quarterly dividend rate and a dividend payout ratio of approximately 26%. We continue to review our capital structure annually and at this time, we\u2019re comfortable maintaining our current credit rating, which gives us flexibility by way of borrowing capacity at favorable rates for acquisitions or to manage through an economic downturn. As I mentioned before, over the last three years, we\u2019ve distributed 100% of each year\u2019s accelerating free cash flow to our stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to be opportunistic with regard to future share repurchases while expecting to subtly increase the dividend, which combined with our focus on operating performance and growth, we believe will create the best frame work for us to deliver total stockholder return. Clearly, we have demonstrated that opportunities we have to reinvest back into our business yield for higher stockholder return, given our growth profile. We\u2019ve increased our dividend rate by 191% over the past five years. Our payout ratio, which has always risen from a base of 20% in fiscal 2010 currently stands at approximately 26% of earnings in line with many other growth companies. We will continue to review our dividend on an annual basis keeping it within the larger framework of a sustainable payout ratio, while being mindful of our continued growth opportunities. Looking ahead, over the next three years, we plan to build on our strategy by continuing to focus on superior executions. We expect global prestige beauty to continue growing about approximately 3% to 4% in fiscal 2015 and to potentially return to 4% to 5% annually thereafter. Our goal remains to exceed this growth by at least one percentage point annually by focusing on the areas that represent the greatest opportunities for momentum and sustainable growth. Our fastest growth is expected to be coming from emerging markets reflecting the continued expansion of the middle class and our medium sized brands as they build awareness and loyalty and expand into the more countries and doors. Skin care and makeup will remain our largest categories and we believe we have an exciting innovation pipeline for the next few years across brands, categories, and geographies. And from a channel perspective the fastest growth is expected to come from our direct to consumer businesses, freestanding stores and online as well as from specialty-multi and travel retail. These topline growth drivers plus cost leverage and savings should allow us to deliver at least 50 basis points of average annual operating margin expansions each year to reach a target of 17.5% in fiscal 2017 as Fabrizio indicated. That takes into account our reinvestment and growth drivers and capabilities necessary to enable the growth and translate into our ability to deliver double digit annual EPS growth in each of the next three years. Last month SMI implementation was the last major wave of a long term project that has enabled us to standardize our key business prophecies around the world. This was an enormous undertaking and our teams executed it superbly. SMI gives us greater consistency and execution, enhanced visibility of information for improved management of inventory and expenses, and process scalability to support growth. As the major deployment phase has ended, we\u2019re focusing our attention on realizing the full value that SMI can deliver through better process adoption and proficiency with using the new technology to drive many efficiencies across the organization. Some of the key areas of opportunity we\u2019re addressing include improvement in forecasting capabilities, which should result in reduced inventories, fewer sales returns and less obsolescence, improved management of the total cost of global and local launches and better enabling our AMP effectiveness, additional indirect procurement savings and improved customer service to name a few. In addition to these planned four benefits, we certainly expect to uncover additional areas of opportunities as our global understanding and visibility of SMI prophecies and SAP technology increases. Importantly we have a governing structure in place to support our initiatives and ensure we have continuous cost improvement every year through leveraging the SMI capability. These savings and efficiencies combined with some pricing mix benefits should allow us to deliver the net margin improvement I mentioned as well as reinvest a portion of the savings generated back into critical areas fundamental to our success and sustainably delivering our strategic objectives, areas such product innovation, digital and ecommerce and retail capabilities as well as supply chain agility to name a few. Now let me discuss our outlook for fiscal 2015. The SMI shift discussed earlier adverse affects the first quarter and full fiscal 2015 year and will also create a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. This is something to keep in mind when modeling the quarters and the full year. So to put this in perspective, I\u2019ll provide our financial expectations for fiscal 2015 both including and excluding the impact of the shift. First, our expectations for reported result, for the full year, sales are forecasted to grow 3% to 4% in constant currency with growth in our international regions continuing to outpace North America. Currency translation is estimated to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 2%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of 1.3 for the Euro, 1.63 for the pound and the 104 for the yen. Reported EPS is expected to range between $2.89 and $2.99. As I mentioned previously, the $178 million of accelerated retail orders equal to a $0.21 per share, which benefited our reported numbers of fiscal 2014, would have normally occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. So let me share with you our comparable non-GAAP expected results excluding the impact of this SMI shift. Constant currency sales growth is forecasted to grow approximately 6% to 7% in line with our long range goals. We plan to achieve expense leverage through a combination of cost savings, net of investments, which combined with improved gross profit margin, our expected to drive operating margin improvement of approximately 40 basis points. Our cost savings initiatives are primarily focused on productivity, indirect procurement, AMP effectiveness and returns and obsolescence. Investment areas include innovation, R&D, supply chain planning and travel retail expansion, as well as retail and HR systems. SMI savings post high procure are somewhat offset by the ongoing support, maintenance in additional depreciation related to SMI. Throughout the fiscal year we will continue to be flexible in our investment spending behind the activities that demonstrate the best momentum which could impact the quarterly cadence of our spending. As you know, our guidance excludes the one-time charge related to the devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar last year. And as a reminder, in fiscal 2014, we derived less than 1% of our net sales from Venezuela. Earlier in this calendar year, the Venezuelan government enacted a margin cap law, along with controls on foreign currency exchange, that affect our comparability in fiscal 2015 to the prior year by approximately one percentage point of earnings growth or $0.03 of EPS. The guidance we are providing this year absorbs the impact of this lower margin. Our fiscal 2015 rate is planned at 30% to 32%. Adjusting for the SMI shift, we are forecasting full year EPS in a range of $3.10 to $3.20. This would be comparable to our fiscal 2014 EPS of $2.95 before charges in the accelerated orders. Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movement, the approximately 2% negative currency impact on our top line this fiscal year equates to about $0.09 of EPS. Excluding this foreign currency exchange impact, our EPS is expected to rise by 8% to 12%. In fiscal 2015, we expect to increase cash flow from operations to approximately $1.7 billion. Our capital plan is $560 million and it will continue to support consumer phasing investments in counters, retail stores, and retail and HR systems. We expect a modest improvement in inventory days in fiscal 2015 with more aggressive improvement in future years as we fully leverage the benefits from SMI. So that is our guidance for the full fiscal year. In our first quarter, on a reported basis we expect sales decline approximately 1% to 2% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately one percentage point. We anticipate that EPS will be between $0.51 and $0.55. Adjusting for the SMI shift, first quarter sales are forecasted to increase between 5% and 6% in constant currency and EPS is expected to be between $0.72 and $.76. Our first quarter profitability is expected to be impacted by the timing of expenses related to new launches and promotional activity compared to the prior year. This is an addition to the increase spending for capabilities I just mentioned. So that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays:  Thanks. My first question was just around capital structure. I think many of us, just even based on what you shared in the recent past conference and so on expected. A little bit more of an update really change in terms of capital structure particularly as you have seen greater visibility and the potential for improvements in cash and inventory after SMI is implemented. So could you just maybe elaborate a little bit more there, if you have plans for where inventory levels could go over the next couple of years, and what your priorities will be for any changes in Cap structure once that comes to path? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis :  Sure Lauren. So again, now that we are in the hyper care stage as it relates to SMI and certainly starting to deploy some of the insight that we\u2019re getting from SMI to aggressively reduce the inventory levels that we have. There are quite new initiatives going on this year that should meaningfully impact our inventory levels towards the back half of the year and certainly in the next few years. So I think we have spoken about at least a 20 to 30 day improvement in inventories over the next few years that we could see clear visibility to. That as it relates to at least our structure currently, most of the free cash flow that we generate is returned to shareholders via dividend and share repurchase activities. So certainly as we free up cash from working capital as we demonstrated this year, with some of the areas of working capital improvements that we had, we fully expect to redistribute that back to shareholders assuming that we don\u2019t have other uses for that cash which -- in the acquisition area. So I think certainly we expect over the next few years that our free cash flow generation will increase as our working capital improves. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays: Okay. Thank you. And then I did have one question for John. The Est\u00e9e Lauder with Pure Color Envy that and Modern Muse I feel like there has been a pretty significant shift in the maybe call it the tone of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand advertising. Have you done any consumer testing at this point or a sense if the consumer profile has shifted at all with those two launches over the last I guess it will be six-plus months now younger, more mobile any kind of change there to know that this is maybe having a bit of the impact you\u2019re hoping for? John Demsey : Sure I'll have it over to Lauren welcome back. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays: Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Lauren welcome back, this is Fabrizio. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays: Thank you so much. Fabrizio Freda : In truth, yes, the new inventory round Pure Color Envy and Modern Muse has brought a younger more contemporary customers to the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand. We\u2019ve seen fantastic performance for both Modern Muse and for Pure Color Envy which is the most successful lip color launch that the brand is having over a decade. So we are bringing younger consumers and the good thing about fragrance and makeup is being transactions. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays : Great. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : A couple of questions, the first is how do you really know what sales from SAP pulled forward and what are normal, meaning like, does the retailer tell you like we\u2019re buying this because, you need to got your SAP stuff in order. And then my real question is, on skin care is there a plan to take back market share because, obviously some of the selling data has been great, but some of the market share data which has improved recently has been a little bit soft. So is there an urgency there and should we expect market share gains in '15? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis :  Okay. so, on the SMI orders what we do is work with our retailers to look at the first few weeks after go live of what the expected sales that they have will be on the expected shipments that we would normally have to support those sales. And those are the sales that we pull forward. So it's skew by skew, its week by week in terms of how we plan with our retailers. Obviously this pull forward was greater than all of the others that we\u2019ve had A, because the markets that were involved were larger, and the time frame of the year is larger. So July is a big time period for us as well as certainly for our retailers in terms of receiving shipments. It\u2019s all the timeframe that we have big launches as you heard from retail, as it relate to Clinique and some of our other brands. But it is the first few weeks of the July time period that we worked with our retailers to plan. Fabrizio Freda : To answer the question on skin care, definitely there are very strong plan to grow market share on skin care. I just wanted to clarify that in fiscal year '14 we did grow market share of skin care globally and we plan to continue to do that. If you\u2019re referring to the North America market U.S. market share, trend in skin care, yes, we didn\u2019t grow market share in the U.S specifically and we have plans to go back to growth via, first of all, innovation. Innovation, which is much more wide space in new areas and less cannibalizing than what we experience in the beginning of fiscal year 2014 and strongly improved merchandising store in this area and new services connected to the skin care area. Also, globally the skin care local relevant approach of our innovation is actually giving us some great returns and so we plan to continue growing market share globally in skin care also across fiscal year 2015. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Right, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research : Hi, good morning. One housekeeping question. Can you tell us what the organic sales growth was for the year overall for Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. So we can see the difference between those and the other brands of your growth overall? And, your organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was 5% and you\u2019re saying its 5% to 6% in the first quarter, both of which are lower than what you think are sustainable organic sales growth will be including for fiscal 2015 overall. Why should we expect that acceleration next year? Fabrizio Freda : First of all, our fiscal year '14 overall, our constant sales growth was 7% and we are forecasting 6% to 7% for '15. So, is not acceleration for the year is consistent. In term of the sales by quarter, again they are heavily dependent on the amount of new innovation to happen in the quarter or in other also in the geography where these innovation is launched and finally in the category in which these innovation is launched. So, as I say every time, don\u2019t attribute too much into reading a single quarter, read our fiscal year overall trend which I think is a much more solid element for predicting the direction and the solidity of our business trend. So, we are 7% in 2014, we predict 6% to 7% and this will be driven as I said by market overall at 3% to 4% in our estimate. So consistent overall global market growth, but a strong innovation our brands and the profile of our growth, will continue to be the double-digit energy market, double-digit online, very strong results into our retail and some markets like the U.K. are doing fantastically well that we expect to continue. And growth in China is expected to continue. And so, there is a full consistent approach to growth which is the strength frankly of our strategy. Tracey Thomas Travis : And we don\u2019t comment on individual brand growth. Fabrizio Freda : But I want to clarify on the individual brand growth that Lauder and Clinique are growing. They are growing globally for the fiscal year and that will continue to grow globally if in some markets their growth has been below the market growth meaning losing some share points, but little share points in some markets but this will not distract by the fact that both of these brands are growing and growing globally. Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research : Are they growing globally in line with the prestige market globally? Fabrizio Freda : They are growing globally in line with the prestige market, also likely below depending by quarter and by brand and that's the ones that we want not to comment on to give too many details, public details\u2026 Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research : But for the year overall? Fabrizio Freda : On our growth rate, but they\u2019re growing and they're growing in a way as I said, we plan to grow market share also in these brands globally over the next two years. Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Fabrizio, against your advice I apologize, I have to ask a question about the quarter, but I was hoping in the context of the picked up investment you\u2019re going to see that you\u2019re talking about in Q1, can you just talk about how extensive that\u2019s going to be to the point that it would not knock earnings lower year-on-year? And I guess, if you can marry that with the fact that the topline for the quarter is expected to be below what the full year range is, I am just curious with the dynamic is there? And then just a quick follow up for Tracy, I think you said 20 to 30 days in inventory coming out, but I thought that you had said over time the number would be much more extensive than that. I thought you guys did something like 130 days, 140 days of inventory might be more reasonable? So, any color there would be fantastic. Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis : So in terms of the quarter and again, some of it has to do with what we\u2019re anniversarying. So, we had major launch activity last year and we have solid launch activity this year as well. There are some margin differences, gross profit margin differences between the launch activity we had last year and the launch activity we had this year. So, that is suppressing some of the margin expansion that you would normally expect to see I think in the first quarter. Clearly it\u2019s even down over the course of, over the year and it\u2019s really first quarter phenomena for us from a gross profit standpoint. In addition to that, I talked about some of the investments that we have in the first quarter. We do have SMI hyper care going on. So that is an investment this quarter that we didn\u2019t have last year. We had SMI going on but much of that activity was, some of that activity was capitalized and some of that activity was expensed. It\u2019s all expensed this quarter as we are in hyper care other than obviously the system itself. We do have some consulting expenses for some projects that we have going on this year that are impacting us in the first quarter as well. So, all of those things are impacting us in Q1, which is why we -- and Fabrizio made the comment quarter-to-quarter really the focus should be on the full year as I think we demonstrated quite solidly last year. As it relates to inventory, you are right on the both the counts, so what I said we have near-term visibility to 20 to 30 days and the team, as the actions in place to drive to that and then we have visibility over time and plans over time to achieve greater than that. So, you\u2019re right on both counts. Fabrizio Freda : And I just want to add one your question on reconciling rest of the sales growth, many of the investments Chris as you referred to are not necessarily in advertising at the immediately the sales growth within the quarter. For example, we are investing in the first quarter into the big part of our R&D investment will happen there. In the direct channel going more direct online sites and things will happen there. We have a trial retail investment that will happen there and then we all benefit the rest of the fiscal year and finally we have investments on the consultants that was discussed in creating the savings that then will impact possibly the next of the fiscal year and in other capabilities like in the area of supply chain fundamentals. So, some of this investment will not provide immediate results on sales within the quarter. We\u2019ll provide first of all sustainable growth in the long term and results on profit in the second part of the year. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of BofA Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch : First, why do you only expect operating margins to be up 40 basis points on a like-to-like basis in fiscal 2015, perhaps can your parse out a bit more in terms of the major drivers there. I know you\u2019ve thought obviously on hyper care expenses, but what have you expected that to be offset more or less by the savings associated with SMI, and then Fabrizio I just want a follow up on your comment about growth in the small and mid size brands versus the Clinique's and Lauder\u2019s are you seeing an acceleration in the divergence of the Lauder and Clinique brands relative to the others or is it just a continuation of what you\u2019ve already being seeing for some time? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : I\u2019ll answer first there on the growth profile of our company. I think I said in the last calls, the profile of our growth is that we have created multiple engine of growths by brand, by channel, by region. Some designs go in certain moments at double digit, other at single digit. But they all provide support to the growth. So, from brand standpoint and John commented on some like M-A-C or the luxury brands which are definitely driving double-digit because of their level of development at their profile and their opportunity for expansion. There are other brands that are definitely, Lauder and Clinique are in this camp in that fiscal year that are driving single digit. The same profile is by channel, we have channels like online, travel retail, freestanding stores, which are driving the business at double digit and other channels like our core department stores which are driving at single digit in this moment. And then during the years, this has changed and our ability to flexibly react to these changes and make sure that we invest where the opportunity is in a given moment of time is also the strengths of our model. So we do keep the flexibility to make these changes and these adjustments on purpose in order to be able to leverage growth where growth is. I'll let Tracey answer the other question. Tracey Thomas Travis : In terms of the 40 basis points, the hyper care just affects the Q1 year-over-year comparison. The SMI net is a benefit this year and we have many other costs savings activities that benefits this year. Some of the investments that we have spoken about as it relates to increasing R&D innovation and other investments to support capabilities for future growth are impacting this year. But we feel very confident that if the sales growth materializes this year then we will very much deliver double-digit profit growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Stephen Powers - UBS: Great, thanks. Maybe, Tracey, if I could push on the capital structure point just a bit. I understand that you are returning much of the excess free cash flow that you are generating to shareholders. But looking forward, clearly you're confident in underlying P&L momentum, and you seem well positioned to accelerate free cash flow ahead of income growth, given the working capital opportunities. So with that plus your starting point of a net cash position, why not take on a bit more positive leverage just in order to accelerate returns to shareholders? Or are there other cash uses, priorities, that we should be considering more near-term -- like M&A, for example? Tracey Thomas Travis : So clearly as we have spoken previously M&A is a high priority for us. We certainly have locked the activity going on in terms of looking at acquisition opportunities and we certain want to reserve flexibility for M&A activity so that's certainly a piece of why we would not consider taking on additional debt at this particular time. And as I mentioned in my prepare able remark, given the improvements that we have made and we will continue to make in certain areas of working capital and the improvement that we have in front of us as it relates to inventory, which now that estimates behind us we can certainly expect more steady improvement as it relates to our inventory turnover that should deliver very strong returns to the shareholders. We are mindful that in order to keep and support the wonderful brands that we have it requires investment. It requires investments in advertizing. It requires investment in infrastructure and in capability. So we balance all of that when we look at the capital structure as well as our plans for any fiscal year. Stephen Powers - UBS: Okay. That's great. Thank you. Then maybe John, you talked a lot about the strength of your current brand portfolio. But with that M&A consideration, maybe looking at things through a different lens, where would you say you have the largest opportunities to fill gaps in the portfolio? And I guess how many of those gaps can be filled with existing brands being extended, versus maybe looking outside to realize opportunities through acquisition? Fabrizio Freda : This is Fabrizio. I think I\u2019ll take this one because I don\u2019t think we can start talking openly about acquisition opportunity by brand or by gap because this would be frankly to match information to our competitors so more than to you. But the key point again as we stated is our overall M&A strategy. Our overall M&A strategy is first of all is a strategy looking at brands, which has global potential. As you know we don\u2019t have a strategy of weak M&A partnership but rather is about buying brands that we can develop over the years. M-A-C is the example of the ideal acquisition strategy for a settled company buying a medium sized brand and making it use huge over the years that\u2019s our strategy in M&A. Now in which areas we focus I said it repeatedly obviously skincare acquisition around the world particularly in Asia at an area where we are starting the market continuously and then there are opportunities in all the area, which are high profitable and growing and where our portfolio is today not completely filled in. and the last thing I want to say is not necessarily a gut feeling strategy. It is really our M&A strategies about buying amazing brands with amazing potential that we can leverage thanks to our great R&D and global reach and create global brand Alamak also in the future. That\u2019s what we are looking for. We are scanning the global market continuously for opportunities and we want to keep the flexibility to engage in these activities when the opportunity arises. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : Good morning. I was hoping to get some detail on what is going on in China. Could you tell us what the same-store sales growth did in the fourth quarter in the Tier 1 cities, and why the sales growth in China picked up overall? Sounds like it was above 10% in the fourth quarter; is that right? Also, what is the status of Osiao? Is it out of test and into full distribution yet? Fabrizio Freda : Okay, so China in the fourth quarter net sales were up 20% and for the year it were double digit and about 13% so very solid performance overall in China across the year. The like door the same door sales in the quarter was actually plus 0.1% so flat and this is a big improvement versus the decline of the overall prestige market same-door in China and our pervious performance in the previous quarter was mine 2.3% so an improvement trend. What is driving that in China again I explained that the big cities because of the developmental of the online, because of the saturation of the market are not growing are not growing anymore same-door sales for sure. While the big expansion is in secondary in Tier 3, Tier 4 cities and online basically expanding the reach of the many interested Chinese consumers have been able to sell to them, that\u2019s what we are doing and that\u2019s why we are successful. We continue build the reach. So we get new consumers into our brands, new Chinese consumers into our brand every quarter. The other thing I said already I want to repeat the fact that the same-door sales are flattish should not scare because for example our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand has the highest productivity per door in the world in China. So as table says same-door does not have a significant impact on profitability. The other positive of China that this new consumers that we are reaching expanding in secondary cities are also very good travelers and when they travel they are interest in our brands because they get to know them better and they buy more of our brands in travel retail or in the big capital travel like Paris, New York or whatever. And thus the other big benefit that we are following up in our analysis and how to continue to build the China\u2019s market. So that's what's happening and as I said I have a big trust that China will continue to be growth driver for us in the future in the next three years on the plan that we are discussing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Sanford C. Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein: Hi, guys. I have two questions. The first one is -- so SMI this quarter, the shift is much larger than projected. So I wanted to use that as a jumping point, because we have seen a lot of, over the years, SAP going to companies; and I think we've rarely seen it be as long or drawn-out or unpredictable as the implementation of this SAP or SMI implementation. So I am trying to understand : Why so many challenges? Perhaps more importantly, if we believe your guidance, whether it be operating margin guidance or even at this point the inventory guidance, it is hard to see what benefit you are actually seeing from SMI. So can you help us unravel that a little bit and give us a sense of quantification of what you will be getting from SMI after all this pain? And is that included or incremental to your guidance? Then I have a follow-up. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. I want to take the first part of the question and Tracey will take you through the benefits of SMI that we see in the next year, which by the way are significant, but the first point why we got high order was mainly our travel retail customers. They decided to order more than we originally estimated because it's their decision how much they want to assess the risk of being under lever under-shipped in the months of July and they want to protect their business. because the business is doing well and so they want to protect and avoid the risk of outer stock because of SAP. As you know many companies in the past had issues in executive SAP meaning that they have some periods where they cannot ship, cannot deliver product after their implementation. So that's why our customers sometimes decide to protect themselves because they have this bad experience from the past. Now the good news is that first of all we monitor that and we don\u2019t double count that. Second good news is that we didn\u2019t give so far any issue to them so that we are really executing SAP with excellence and I believe we are one of the best companies in the way we are executing SAP and avoiding the issues that probably you have seen or volatility and consistency that come from the implementation in other cases. So that's as far as the volume orders. Tracey Thomas : Ali. You are right. It has been a long journey. The good news is that this last wave that we just went through is our last major wave. We have a few markets left to go alive on SMI, but we think we can manage those within normal course of business. So the supply chain team, the finance team, the business team that have been focused on SMI implementation are now focused on value realization and really levering the benefits of the system where the organization has been focused on a long drawn out SMI implementation as you indicate. The areas of improvement that I mentioned in my prepared remarks the improvement in forecasting capabilities area real and we are putting action plans together. We have good start to action plans to improve those forecasting capabilities that should help us in the areas of inventory. It will help us in the areas of margin. It will help us in the areas of freight. So as we look throughout the P&L we have to identify where saving opportunities will occur. And as it relates to launches, some of the improvements that we expect to see in terms of some of the resources involved in launches, from some of the better visibility that we get with SAP indirect procurement savings. We have launched Phase II of our indirect procurement savings, which will deliver a meaningful amount of savings over the next few years. As we look at over the next three years the SMI saving there are certainly some embedded within this fiscal year and in fiscal '16 and '17 even greater amount of SMI savings. As it relates to this year and why you are not seeing more of it, one of things as a global company with lots of opportunities we pace the investment of that opportunities and right now it's based on some of the saving imitative that we we're generating from SMI and other initiatives. So where in the past we have had more benefit from a combination of saving activities and margin expansion, gross profit margin expansion, I think I have indicated in the past that more of our margin expansion opportunities will come in the cost saving areas. So cost saving actions have actually become more contributing in terms of our ability to not only expand margin but also to reinvest back into business. So what you are seeing is the net impact of all of that, but Fabrizio mentioned R&D innovation. There are lots of areas this year that we are ensuring our foundation for not only this year\u2019s growth but the next few years of growth that allow us to be able to stay with a good degree of confidence based on our insight right now that we continue to deliver double-digit growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thank you. I would like to go back to China if I might and just ask a couple more questions about that. The Chinese in travel retail, you mentioned you were optimistic because more people knew your brand and were traveling out of China. But did you actually see a pickup in Chinese purchases in travel retail of your brands? And related to that, Korean brands appear to be doing very well in Korea, in China and globally and I am wondering if that's having a negative impact on you at all, or if there is perhaps an acquisition opportunity that you can look at, if there are any because it's been a while since you've actually found something you have been able to land of any scale. Is that on your radar, the Korean brands? Fabrizio Freda : So first of all, travel retail, Chinese will continue for a long term to be one of the most travelers. In the last year, we didn't see -- we saw an increase of overall number of Chinese traveling and their destinations have changed dramatically. The Southeast issues like turmoil in Vietnam or in Thailand or the Malaysia, unfortunate situations and they create for example a decrease in travel of Chinese in South East Asia. The Chinese now travelled much more in Japan and in Korea, some of these also influenced by currencies interest of the Chinese travelers, the Hong Kong situation, the Chinese traveling will be less to Hong Kong. So it\u2019s a very volatile situation, more than volatile, dynamic situation where the overall traveling trend for Chinese continue to be strong, although growing at lower pace than in the last year, but continue to be strong. Where they travel is very dynamic and so the companies that are able to better understand these, analyze it and make sure the trends are dynamically moved accordingly to their corridors are the companies that will do a better job and I think we\u2019re very good at that and we\u2019re following this carefully and as I said we value the flexibility of our model exactly because of this. The second part of your question is Korean brands. Now clearly in Korea, Korean brands have done very well and as we said, we took a couple of years to understand how to more effectively compete. I think we\u2019re some interesting results. Some of our new brands like Jo Malone and Aveda they\u2019re doing fantastically well in Korea, so we\u2019re learning how to compete also with our new brands in this market and in other markets like China, we see Korean brands mainly in mass being very successful. Frankly in prestige they\u2019ve not yet impacted in any way our trends to continue to be very solid as you see and in travel retail, in Korea, mainly in Seoul, Korean brands are significant. There\u2019s been significant frankly in our new -- been significant for the last three or four years. But around the world, it still is growing. You\u2019re right. But it's not to a pace where in any way is limiting our current growth but they are a formidable competitors. They definitely are an additional formal competitor, which meant yes, we\u2019re looking and we\u2019re evaluating opportunities on how to compete or participate to this growth in a more efficient way in the future. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research :  Good morning, everyone. I would like to go back to travel retail and perhaps, Tracey, if you could tell us, for Q4 specifically, what was your retail sales growth and your shipment growth. Because it seems to me that you ship ahead of retail sales, but it still fell below passenger traffic. And if you can tell us what is happening in the travel retail channel -- LVMH commented on very low conversion rates. What gives you confidence that sales in these channels are going to rebound? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Just want to give you the data, our retail sales for fiscal year '14 in travel retail has been plus 8% and our net sales just a little bit higher than that and the traffic was about 5%. So just to keep the record straight, we\u2019ve been growing solidly ahead of traffic in term of retail sales and travel retail. Now Tracey will\u2026 Tracey Thomas Travis : And Javier, so in terms of obviously they went live with SAP. So we certainly advanced shift in Q4 in support of the first few weeks of go-live and they did increase -- our customers did increase their shipment as it relates to that. We\u2019re starting to see passenger traffic pickup. One of the reasons why travel retail increased their orders was July is a very important travel period for travel retail. So it\u2019s a heavy volume period and to make sure that they had the product in order to support that volume period, if we had any issues they wanted to have a greater degree of certainty. So we\u2019re starting to see passenger traffic pickup and as Fabrizio said, we\u2019ve continued to outpace passenger traffic in the last few years in our travel retail business. So we benefit from traffic growth. We\u2019ve also been as John indicated earlier expanding some of our brands, particularly our luxury brands and other brands in the travel retail channel, which has been an accelerator on our travel retail growth and we continue to see opportunities and that is certainly in our plans this year to continue to have travel retail be an outperformer in channel growth and our overall growth. Operator :  We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga of Piper Jaffray. Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray :  I want to thank John upfront for spending so much time on his brands. He's had a fantastic career at Estee Lauder; it's great to hear from him. For retail, I want to ask you a little bit more of a philosophical question around distribution in this digital era. So as consumers are migrating more online for both their search and purchase behavior and activities, obviously essentially landing people directly to your brand sites -- so I am just wondering, hypothetically speaking in the future how is the role between Estee Lauder and the retail and distribution partners, how is it going to evolve in this digital era? Any insights you can share with us? That would be helpful. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, frankly my point of view is that the digital area will strengthen our relationship with our retail partners and we are constantly working side to side with them to support their eCommerce and their digital expansion of activities. So all the customers, which have the retail partners which have the best dot com activities are also the one which delivers the strongest brick-and-mortar sales. There is a clear strong connection between success of the retailer online and success of the same retailer in brick-and-mortar. So we are participating to the development of the business of our retail partners both in brick-and-mortar and online and we\u2019re very supportive including putting our capabilities in cooperating with them in developing this business because this Omni channel approach, that many of the global retailers that we partner with are taking I believe is the future. It is the right future. So it's true that we\u2019ve also some of our brands with strong direct sites, which we sell direct to the customer like it's true that we have some of our strong brands with great freestanding stores where we sell our brick-and-mortar direct to the consumer as well. So we see our direct size like our freestanding store M-A-C for example and they used to penetrate the markets where our retail partners are not or to create flag-shipped brand equity building activities and show creativity and strength or to complement high traffic areas. But they never used in competition with our retail partners. So all the move to direct online and in brick-and-mortar is actually -- is a great move for accessing the consumer around the world and to develop the brand equities and our wholesale business is actually benefiting from these activities in a big way. So my view is very positive and very constructive. Operator :  That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. If you are unable to join for the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 PM Eastern Time today through August 29. To hear a recording of the call, please dial (855) 859-2056, passcode 82074353. That concludes today's Est\u00e9e Lauder Conference Call.

Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 due to the July implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, which would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter. We will note the impact of the shift in orders on our fiscal 2015 first quarter results and full year expectations. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered a solid financial performance despite a difficult global backdrop, highlighting the benefit of our broadly diversified business. Like many companies, we operated against several macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, ranging from the foreign currency headwinds and slower growth in some of our markets to unrest in Hong Kong, the Middle East and Ukraine. We weren't immune to the challenges, but many of our brands, countries and channels were resilient and even vibrant. Our best-performing areas were our luxury and makeup brands, our online, travel retail and freestanding store channel as well as the European region where we gained share. Our sales rose 5% in local currency, meeting our expectations and continuing a pattern on profitable quarterly growth. Earning per share came in above our forecast. Prestige Beauty overall remains healthy, as consumers are constantly drawn to innovative products and the hottest trends. Our creativity and ability to react quickly has enabled us to capitalize on many areas that we are winning. Looking across prestige beauty. Makeup is in the spotlight, generating the stronger growth. Our 3 fantastic makeup-focused brands helped fuel this trend with great success. Each one grew double digits. M-A-C is our largest makeup brands and a true powerhouse and generated another terrific quarter, with strong momentum globally and standout results in the U.K. and Latin America. We continue to build awareness and strategically fill distribution voids by opening freestanding stores and M-A-C created product launches continue to attract consumers. Lipsticks were strong sellers as well our new innovative kits and assortment of pallets. M-A-C next VIVA GLAM spoke model, Miley Cyrus is certain to bring attention to the brand and to aid age-related philanthropic causes when the new lip products will launch in January. Bobbi Brown introduced exciting products that captivated consumers, including a new version of its iconic skin foundation stick and updated its counters with a new marketing campaign, featuring its celebrity spokesperson, Kate Upton. And Smashbox's strength in the specialty-multi channel generated significantly higher sales globally. Makeup also lifted the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand led by its Pure Color Envy franchise, which launched last spring with lipstick and this quarter, expanded to eyeshadow and is selling well globally. Foundations were also strong for Est\u00e9e Lauder, helped by its launch of Perfectionist makeup and strength in double ware. Skin care remains our largest category and we are creating products that appeal to multiple demographics and add incremental sales. The most significant launches came from Clinique. Its Smart Custom-Repair Serum had strong consumers' reception and became the best-selling antiaging prestige skin care serum in the U.K. where Clinique is the #1 prestige beauty brand. Clinique's Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush marks the company first entry into the device category. It is selling particularly well in Asia and travel retail and recently launched in the U.S. We expect this new product to generate good momentum for Clinique in the second half of the fiscal year. Several other brands also have exciting skincare launches coming up in areas with strong consumer interest. Est\u00e9e Lauder new Enlighten line of products target uneven skin tone. And its high-end Re-Nutriv ultimate diamond dual infusion will strengthen its position in premium skin care. La Mer and Origins are exploiting renewed interest in facial masks, with several offering that treat different concerns. La Mer launched the Intensive Revitalizing Mask in many markets. In the U.K., nearly 1/4 of the units sold was to first-time consumers, which demonstrates the brand's success in creating innovative products that attract new users. Our powerful portfolio is filled with high-quality prestige brands. Our mix -- the midsized luxury brands, which cater to more affluent consumers, enjoyed the fastest growth, both in the U.S. and globally. Sales from Tom Ford, La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone rose double digits from both like-door growth and targeted distribution gains as they continued to expanding to reach new consumers. In their early stages, these brands were among our smallest. But after rapid expansion in recent years, they have not only grown in size but have become significant contributors to growth. Channel diversity remains one of our strengths. Our E&M commerce business grew almost 30% globally. The impressive increase came primarily from organic growth. But we added 4 brand sites and refreshed other sites with new technology and navigation. Visits to our brand sites globally rose 22% this quarter and other metrics also shows important gains. Sales from our freestanding store also rose sharply, reflecting our strategy to build our business in this channel globally. Led by our luxury and specialty brands, our net sales in travel retail grew double digits. Our retail sales in the channel, however, rose 4%, slightly below the growth in passenger traffic, largely due to major product launches the previous year from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands and a falloff in Chinese tourists in Hong Kong, where we have a very high share. Travel retail is one of our important engines and we expect to return to retail growth ahead of traffic because of strong initiative on the biggest brands opening more doors and expanding distribution in high-growth mid-sized brands. In travel retail, our net sales exceeded retail sell-through because we needed to supply to new doors and retailers were bullish ahead of Asian Golden Week holiday travel. We expect a rebalancing of trade inventories in the second quarter. Geopolitical issues are making global travel factors more volatile, which are reflected in our travel business. This quarter, the strongest retail growth was in the Americas, while the last 2 years, Asia/Pacific had the biggest surge in sales growth. By being flexible, we directed and will continue to direct our investment to the biggest regional opportunities contributing to sustained growth. Outside of travel retail, our geographic strength was centered in Europe, the Middle East & Africa, where we posted excellent growth despite a continued economic malaise in many European countries. Our U.K. business remained excellent with double-digit growth at retail ahead of net sales, with most brands contributing. Our brands were strong in Western Europe, but grew even faster in emerging markets in the region, led by Russia. Retail sales grew ahead of prestige beauty in many countries, enabling us to gain share. Emerging markets are an important part of our growth story and continue to provide much of our fuel. Excluding China, sales in our emerging market rose more than 30%, with superb results in many countries including the Middle East, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa. This group is as large as China and continues to provide strong momentum, demonstrating the balance across our business and the scope of our geographic strength. China remains our largest single emerging market. And last month, I spend time there to get the first-hand update on consumer sentiment and current market dynamics. The fundamentals driving increased consumption in China remain positive and the country remains one of our major long-term opportunities. Wealth creation and disposable income continue to rise among the growing middle class. They are passionate about beauty products and aspire to prestige beauty brands. Near term, prestige beauty sales continue to grow and we are the leader. But the market has become more complex. Competition is intensifying in prestige, promotions have increased and the gifting of luxury items has decreased. At the same time, Korean trends are gaining in popularity and some Korean brands have carved out the masstige tier, attracting some of the consumers stepping up from us. In total, our retail sales in China rose 5% against a slight net sales decline. We entered 9 new tier cities and launched Origins on Tmall. Online is the fastest-growing channel for beauty in China and our e-commerce sales doubled, although it is a small percentage of our business. Sales of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand declined slightly in the quarter, reflecting the previous year initiative and the high promotional environment I mentioned. Est\u00e9e Lauder is the top prestige brand in China in its distribution, and we are working on many exciting new initiatives to further build its momentum and adjust to the new competitive reality. Nonetheless, all our other brands, from Clinique through to M-A-C, had robust double-digit retail growth this quarter in China, creating a more balanced brand and category mix. The recent introduction of Jo Malone is off to a great start and well ahead of our goals. Makeup is gaining momentum and our makeup brands grew solidly by embracing Korean trends and appealing to consumer with the most relevant products and looks. As the global leader in prestige makeup, we anticipate China will become a more significant factor in our makeup business. During the quarter, fewer Chinese traveled to Hong Kong, where last year, more than half of our domestic sales came from Chinese tourists. This was influenced by a change last fall that restricted group visas. In light of the recent protests, fewer individual tourist visas were issued. Despite fewer Chinese travelers, our Hong Kong sales in the quarter were flat. However, starting in the final days of September, large protests resulted in business closing and kept people away from key shopping districts. The situation has continued and is expected to sharply impact our business in Hong Kong in the second quarter. Balancing the softer-than-anticipated results in Greater China was positive news out of other Asian-Pacific countries, namely Korea, Japan and Australia, where both net and retail sales generated strong growth. We had a strong turnaround in Korea, as our brands tapped into consumer preferences and leveraged local trends. Many of our larger brands had positive growth, including Est\u00e9e Lauder, M-A-C, Bobbi Brown and several of our smaller brands such as Jo Malone, Aveda and La Mer resonated strongly in the market. As a company, we gained share in Japan in our distribution with Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Jo Malone and M-A-C showing excellent gains, while our online business grew double digits. In Australia, our sales grew double digits due to improved market conditions and growth in our brands across many channels. The U.S. remains our biggest market and our brands hold the top 10 prestige skin care SKUs and 8 of the top 10 makeup SKUs. Many of our brands showed healthy growth, including M-A-C, La Mer, Jo Malone and Smashbox, all of which gained share. Although prestige beauty has accelerated overall from the pace a year ago, the majority of the growth is being driven by online as foot traffic in brick-and-mortar stores has slowed. It has -- it was a challenging quarter for our multi-category brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, in the U.S., which posted lower retail sales versus the previous year in brick-and-mortar department stores where they generate most of their business. This was partly because they were up against difficult comparisons with the previous year when they launched reformulations of important iconic products. We believe fewer Chinese travelers also impacted the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand in its home market. Both Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, however, had good growth in their e-commerce businesses in the United States. We expect the upcoming holiday season to be solid, with the consumer paying particular attention to value and attractive online shopping offers. With that in mind, our brands will continue strong marketing investment against their recent product launches and have created compelling assortments of gift sets that offer desirable products with good value. They are also working actively with the retail partners on their online sites to drive sales. We are actively working to radiate [ph] growth in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique in the U.S. in the second half of the fiscal year, with multi-category innovations and we'll continue to support our retailers with compelling advertising, merchandising programs and in-store activities to increase traffic. We expect to generate sales growth of 5% to 6% this fiscal year, with the significant contribution coming from M-A-C and our mid-sized brands. To maintain our steady annual growth, we are driving our portfolio on 2 main fronts. We are strengthening and expanding our existing brands to keep them relevant in all regions, and at the same time, we are actively seeding and nurturing the next generation, with an eye to creating the next big brands of the future. As part of this plan, we recently acquired 2 small brands that have long-term potential to contribute to our continuing growth. Le Labo is a high-end fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand that emphasize craftsmanship and personalization. And RODIN olio lusso is a luxury oil-based skin care collection. Both brands have a unique position and are targeted to the ultra-prestige consumer, which is core to our strategy. With over 60 years of brand building leadership, we are confident we can help these brands grow and prosper like we continue to do successfully with many other acquisitions such as Jo Malone and La Mer. The founders of Le Labo and RODIN will stay with the company and together, we will execute our collective vision. We welcome their ideas and entrepreneurial spirit, which fit perfectly with the heritage of the Est\u00e9e Lauder companies. We demonstrated this quarter that thanks to numerous growth engines, our ability to aggressively drive our best opportunities and continued focus on managing cost efficiencies, we navigated short-term challenges and delivered solid growth and financial results. We are making progress and are determined to deliver the saving through our SMI program that are embedded in our long-term margin targets. Our July rollout of SMI Wave 4 has gone extremely well, and I want to thank all of our employees who have served this project with extreme dedication and terrific results. With our diverse brand portfolio, a balanced worldwide business and increased exposure to fastest growth channels, we believe we will continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth long term. We have a winning formula. More than 2/3 of our businesses is growing solidly and we have discipline in our management of expenses. We will continue investing in marketing programs and capabilities that are necessary to maintain our long-term growth and remain committed achieving our financial goals. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal 2015 first quarter results and then I will share with you our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. To better demonstrate our underlying business performance, my commentary excludes the first quarter and full year impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that shifted sales from the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our July rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift was $178 million in sales and $127 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.21 per share. Also excluded is the year-over-year impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales for the first quarter rose 5% as reported and also in local currency, in line with our expectations. Every geographic region and every product category contributed to constant currency sales growth in the quarter, demonstrating the benefits of our diverse portfolio. Our gross profit margin of 79.6% was 10 basis points below the prior year period, primarily reflecting the net of unfavorable mix offset by favorable pricing. Operating expenses improved 10 basis points to 62.7% of sales. Advertising and marketing investment decreased 140 basis points as planned, as we anniversary heavy spending from last year's major skin care and fragrance launches in the quarter, with the smaller product launches in this year's quarter. This favorability was offset primarily by a combination of higher retail store operating costs and investment spending behind key initiatives. As a result, operating margin remained unchanged at 16.9%, earnings per share increased to $0.80, above the top end of our guidance range, reflecting more disciplined cost management. All elements of working capital improved in the quarter, with inventory days to sell improving by 2 days to 193 days. During the quarter, we generated a $98 million improvement in cash flow from operating activities, primarily through working capital improvements. We invested $79 million in capital projects, primarily to support new retail stores and new counters. We utilized $207 million in cash to repurchase approximately 2.7 million shares of our stock, well more than the amount purchased during last year's first quarter. We also used $78 million through dividends to stockholders, ending the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. A small portion of cash was used in the second quarter as we acquired RODIN and Le Labo. Additionally, this morning, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. Let me now turn to our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal year. At this time, we are maintaining our view that the global prestige beauty will grow between 3% to 4% this fiscal year, but we do expect with the macro issues Fabrizio mentioned impacting Asia and other markets, it will now be toward the low end of that range. Our sales for the full fiscal year adjusted for the accelerated retailer orders are now expected to grow 5% to 6% in constant currency. This primarily reflects the recent retail disruptions in Hong Kong and a reduction in sales from Chinese travelers globally. The U.S. dollar has strengthened since we last provided guidance and currency translation is now expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points versus the 2 percentage points we gave you previously. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of 1.24 for the euro, 1.62 for the pound and 1.10 for the yen. We remain committed to both near-term and long-term margin progression. For fiscal 2015, we now expect constant currency operating margin growth of approximately 30 to 40 basis points. The reduction in expected tourism impacts our higher-margin channels, geographies and product categories. Now that we have successfully completed the last major wave of SMI, we are actively engaged in driving the SMI benefits that we shared with you last quarter. As a reminder, efforts are underway to leverage the new processes and tools we have implemented to enhance our forecasting capability which should result in progressive improvements in the inventory levels needed to support our sales, fewer sales returns and less obsolescence. We are also working on improved management of the total cost of global and local product launches, which further enables our A&P effectiveness and are identifying additional procurement savings and productivity improvements. We have reorganized our internal team to more fully integrate SMI value creation and our efforts behind other cost savings initiatives to maximize the realization of benefits behind the biggest cost opportunity areas. As I have mentioned previously, these multiyear savings programs do enable us to reinvest a portion of that savings that are generated into capability areas such as product innovation and R&D, digital and e-commerce and retail capabilities and other areas critical to our success in sustainably delivering our strategic objectives. The net benefits of these combined efforts are reflected in our forward 3-year margin guidance. These efforts, combined with our brand growth strategies, allow us to continue to support our long-term margin goal of 17.5% by the end of fiscal 2017, despite the short-term macro headwinds we are managing through this year. For this fiscal year, we have adjusted our full year EPS expectation to a range of $3.03 to $3.11. This compares to our fiscal 2014 EPS of $2.95 before charges and the accelerated orders. The 3 percentage points of negative currency translation on our top line this fiscal year equates to about $325 million or $0.13 of EPS. Excluding this currency impact, our EPS is now expected to rise by 7% to 10% versus 8% to 12%, previously provided. Our expectations for reported full year GAAP results are for sales to grow 2% to 3% in constant currency. Earnings per share are expected to be between $2.82 and $2.90. Regarding the second quarter, our sales are expected to grow 3% to 4% in local currency. Translation could contract growth by approximately 4 percentage points. While our marketing investments behind recent product launches as well as our promotional activities around holiday should help drive sales growth, the Hong Kong challenges are expected to have the greatest effect in the October to December quarter. Our retail sales in Hong Kong fell more than 20% during the first weeks of October and declined over 40% in the affected areas of the protest. To put this into context, as Fabrizio mentioned, more than half of our business in Hong Kong is derived from Chinese Mainland visitors. Additionally, the sudden slowdown in both Hong Kong and travel retail is causing some retailers to recalibrate inventory levels. This pressures our net sales in the quarter, but bodes well for reorders in the second half of the year. We anticipate that second quarter EPS will come in between $1.01 and $1.05. Approximately 4% negative currency impact on sales growth in the quarter equates to about $0.05 per share. When managing a broad global business like ours, disruptions in any part of the world can or are likely to happen periodically. Our agility in recalibrating our business while continuing to support our strategic objectives allows us to continue to deliver solid results without sacrificing our future growth potential. Indeed, the growth expectations for prestige beauty continue to be among the most robust and consistent in the consumer sector. Our position in prestige beauty is strong, due in part to the investments we continue to make in our brands and channels globally to enable their continued momentum. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Management. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : A couple questions. The -- just thinking about your travel retail business, and you've been building that business by conversion partly. And I'm just curious if you can give us an update on that strategy. I think it was 10% of all shoppers going through duty-free were actually buying one of your products. And I'm just curious if you can give us an update on that. And then on the acquisitions, should we be thinking about a Smashbox type of growth curves here in terms of how it's going to contribute to your business? If you can just frame how we should think about these acquisitions and its impact on the P&L? Fabrizio Freda : Okay, on travel retail, we are working very actively on conversion. Things like advertising in light boxes in the biggest airports for us, for example, working, marketing activities, airport online activities connected and obviously launches and merchandising on the launches of our new initiatives. We started from about 10% of people we are converting. We believe this is growing and now we are in the range of 12%, 15%. Over time, this may continue. Now obviously, there is no perfect number of this, but those are numbers that we collect airport-by-airport with our experience there, so it's difficult to do an average global number after this. But we are sure that the conversion ability of our activity is increasing and we will continue work on this strategy, which I believe in the medium, long term is a very important piece of the continuous increase of sales in travel retail. In term of our acquisitions, those are very small brands that we have acquired really to grow for the long term. Our acquisition strategy includes the idea of taking some brand that we believe are outstanding and particularly which are managed by outstanding entrepreneurs that we really love to get also in the company working with us on these brands and to grow these brands over the long term in their space. Now we have capabilities. We cover 140 countries. We have great R&D capability. We cover travel retail, we cover online. So we can give to these small brand access to opportunities they didn't have before. And this will drive, we believe, outstanding growth over the years. Is more think of La Mer, when we acquired La Mer, was a $1 million business and today, is the brand that it is. So that's the spirit, but it's not comparable to Smashbox. Smashbox was already a mid-sized brand and obviously has been growing, is doing fantastic, but is doing fantastic from an already bigger base. Tracey Thomas Travis : So the impact on our P&L this year will be de minimis and in the next few years, relatively small as well, although the brands are expected to have strong accelerated top line growth. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And then just one question on skin care. I mean, you talked a lot about the initiatives that you have in place, but this is a business that's been soft for the last few quarters. And just curious, from a competitive standpoint, is there anything that we should be thinking about in a certain region or a certain competitor that might make your path back to growth a little bit more challenging? Fabrizio Freda : So I think that we have been growing a bit less in skin care in the last quarters than we used to. And this is because we have a big business and because some of our initiatives delivered below our original expectation. But I still believe our skin care innovation pipeline is very solid. The opportunity to grow skin care in the long term remains big. The way we are thinking is we are increasing the amount of innovation in skin care. That's the concept. We have -- the growth of new categories in the skin care arena has been very interesting and very promising and we need to tap more into these new categories to grow more aggressively skin care, which we are going to do. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : A couple things I wanted to get some more clarity on. One is to go back to skin care. One of the drivers of innovation, I thought, as you mentioned last conference call, was R&D spend. We haven't seen that tick up, so want to get an update on that and if that's going to help your skin care numbers going forward. And how much of that skin care weakness was related to the Americas, which obviously, it was flat, the U.S. was down. We're starting to hear that some of the retailers are doing better in the mask area and want to know if you think that has an impact on your business. And then 2 other questions, more long term in nature. One is from the market rate, that you still believe in the kind of 3% to 4% range, albeit more towards the 3% range, but you're taking down your top line by about 1 point. Is that just kind of in the rounding, or do you think you're exposed more than the marketplace to some areas of weakness? And then the last part, I apologize, trying to squeeze it in, the last part is this year, you're saying 7% to 10% EPS growth x currencies, x SMI. As you look forward, can you give us a sense of what you think drives you back to double-digit EPS growth? And how much of that is macro versus how much of that is stuff that you're going to do yourself? Tracey Thomas Travis : Well, Ali, so I'll start with the R&D investment. Our R&D investment is -- we are making incremental investments this year in R&D. Some of those investments certainly are geared towards skin care. So that certainly should -- is anticipated to help our innovation plans in the next few years and is critical to our strategic growth plans. But we actually have been increasing our R&D investment the last couple of years and certainly plan to do so again this year. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, on the skin care is the -- yes, there is, in the U.S. obviously, we -- our skin care has not been growing as strongly as it used to and so that's part of the issue that we are going to address. We need to increase the amount of innovation in the U.S. market to compete in a market that in skin care is becoming much the competitive, and that's the plan. There is innovation in multiple different skin care categories, well beyond moisturizers, serums, which are the traditional ones, as an example, masks, oils. So the skin care has become more competitive because innovation is happening at the same time in multiple categories. We are adjusting and actually anticipating with some new, I believe, strong ideas, these kind of trends for the future. The other thing that has been addressed in skin care is also linked to R&D. And a big part of the skin care consumption of the world comes from Asia. The moment Asia/Asia travelers are a bit softer, automatically, this has a negative input on the percentage of skin care sold. Today, there is this dynamic that we have discussed in the remarks that the softness of Asian travelers versus other travelers, for example, of other emerging markets has an impact on skin care. The third effort, there are some new trends in skin care, which are mainly Asian trends that we can address. And this frankly doesn't require necessarily R&D capability, but require the conceptual ability to transfer these existing brilliant products among regions. And that's also something which is happening and we will continue to do more aggressive that will push up our innovation programs in skin care. Last question that you had was on the 7%, 10% EPS growth x currency. And we -- that's a range. We had before an 8%, 12% range. And in that range, obviously, what will influence this range is, first of all, the sales, how the sales will go and importantly, the mix of the sales, because some of our sales are more profitable than others by channel, by category, by brand. So the mix of the sales is what is in this range. The level of the sales and importantly, the level of some of our cost saving programs, how much of this will be, at the end, impacting current fiscal year. As Tracy explained, we are working very hard to ensure that maximization of the saving year after year in line with our SMI goals. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This question really follows up on that question about the long-term growth rate, but looking specifically at the margin dynamic in 2 of your businesses. We've heard reports that your margins in the travel retail business are coming down just because of the extra investment spending you're doing there, just building out the light boxes in the airports and all of that. Can you talk about that specifically, just the margin trends within travel retail and where you see them going? And then secondarily, I know your margins were up strongly in Asia this quarter. And you talked about lower investment spending, I'm sure that's just a timing issue. But given what you talked about in terms of increased competition, the heightened promotional activity and what sounds like maybe a mix shift towards more makeup as opposed to skin care in Asia, should we expect Asia margins to kind of be flat to down? Again, I don't care about the second quarter, but kind of over the next 18 months, 24 months, is Asia going to be an area for margin compression, do you think? Tracey Thomas Travis : Okay. So let me start, Wendy, with the travel retail question. Our travel retail margins are not under pressure. We have been investing in light boxes over the last few years and our travel retail margins have been steadily improving. So that is not an issue for this year. We have invested in opening new points of distribution for some of our luxury brands, our makeup brands as well as Aveda. So a lot of the investment in travel retail this year is for new distribution, which certainly has proven to be productive and profitable for us. So we certainly are bullish on the travel retail business going forward and don't expect margin pressure. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And on the Asia margins, I think in Asia, the investments will continue and we will continue to invest in building the markets. Obviously, we will adjust the investments to the level of opportunities. The moment like it was this quarter where there was certain noise, certain softness, we felt that was not needed to push the investment beyond reasonable because the consumers were not reacting anyway. And also, we are trying not to make Asia over promotional. So we have tried, sometimes we accept lower volumes, like in this case, in China, to avoid it to become over promotional. And so those are choices for the long term. And they, yes, may have an impact quarter-by-quarter. But in the long term, we don't believe there will be margin pressures because of needed investments. Now the evolution of the mix by countries, this is obviously -- could be a big positive. There are countries which are more profitable, and countries which are less profitable, in China, so the mix is an element. The other element is the cost savings. Also in Asia, we have -- part of these cost savings that Tracey already referred to are also happening in Asia, where there is a lot of work going on in this moment on SMI value-creation activities. So the mix of all this, I believe, will allow us to continue over time to develop, in the proper way, our margin in Asia. Tracey Thomas Travis : And the only thing I'll add to that, Wendy, is clearly this year, and you said you weren't focused on the short term, which is good, some of the shortfall that we're seeing relative to our prior expectations in -- because of some of the macro events, given the geography that they're impacting do impact the skin care business, so that is a high-margin business for us, as you know. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And I think we were very clear in the prepared remarks. Hong Kong skin care is among the most profitable businesses in Asia, and frankly, around the world. That's why it's difficult to offset it in a short term. Actually it would be the wrong decision, in our opinion, to try to offset it in the short term, cutting investment, which are, on the contrary, good investment, which will provide long-term solid growth. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : My question is around the guidance for the full year relative to the second quarter. Your comparisons are much harder as you move to the back half of the year, be it sales or margins. And so if your second quarter comes in, in your guidance range, what are the factors that you think can drive sales growth and margin acceleration so much that you can get to the full year number? What's going to happen in the back half despite those tough comps? Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes. So Caroline, actually the second half is a bit easier for us from a comp standpoint. So we -- as we said earlier in our prepared remarks, we had major launches in the first quarter of last year related to Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. And we had softer launches, certainly, this year relative to last year. In the second half of the year, we have lots of good programs planned for both Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique, as well as our other brands. We have the benefit of new door openings that have happened during the course of the back half of last year and the beginning of this year that will help from a growth standpoint. And we are assuming that the Hong Kong situation is really a first half issue and that it will return to growth in the second half. So those are the things that are embedded within our second half earnings, both sales and profit, that lead us to provide the guidance that we did for the year. Fabrizio Freda : There is also -- in the U.S., there is also, in the third quarter, there is a low base of retail because there was one less week in retail. So the indexes would be helped by that situation, by the low base last year. Tracey Thomas Travis : And the polar vortex. Fabrizio Freda : . Yes. And also, I mean, all of you will remember the toughest winter on earth that we had last year in the U.S. and we have expectation that this has created a low base in term of retail opportunities for this very big market for us. And finally, there are many markets that last year were under pressure like Korea where, as we just said, frankly this is very good news, that we are again growing in Korea, like Russia, like Australia, like -- then there was the Venezuela issue last year in the second semester. So our assessment is actually we have an easier base, as Tracey said, in the second 6 months. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : First, just talking again about U.S. retail. So in terms of the Chinese traveler impact, I know there are some stores where you have a dramatic, really significant data suggesting the prevalence of Chinese travelers in that store, in particular. So is there any data or even anecdotally you could provide to say how much traffic was in some of these very Chinese traveler heavy particular retail outlets? That's one. And then two, outside of that issue, just a little bit around the retail environment in general in the U.S., because I know that some of the data across retail mall traffic centers have been weak. So what are you anticipating as you look forward into the calendar fourth quarter for holiday, and just what you think the overall health of the U.S. luxury market is outside of the Chinese traveler issue? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. Let me start from the overall. So the market, that grew about 5%, overall, in the quarter that we just closed, which was better than July-September last year. So the overall market in beauty, prestige beauty, in the U.S. is growing and is continue to grow faster than mass. So the fundamental phenomenon of -- that we had been driving over time and discussed with many of you that the ideal sourcing from mass and growing prestige faster than mass, this is still happening and is happening in a positive trend. The second reality is that, however, the way the growth is happening, the amount of growth which is happening online and in E&M commerce is increasing. We had strong growth online in the U.S. Our retail partners are having outstanding growth in their retail with us. And so the proportion of the growth that goes to retail is increasing. As a consequence, the pressure on brick-and-mortar productivity is also increasing, because there is less growth in the brick-and-mortar path and that's what you refer to the fact that traffic in some malls is not exciting and that's -- the 2 phenomenon are related. And so it's very important, over time, that we are doing this with many of our retail partners to continue to look at the productivity of the brick-and-mortar and to create traffic opportunities and to continue to build traffic also in brick-and-mortar in the right way. We believe holiday will be a great opportunity for that. Tracey Thomas Travis : And then, Lauren, as it relates to your question on Chinese traveling consumers and their impact in the U.S., in the doors that are measured where we know there is a disproportionate amount of tourists, we have seen a disproportionate impact in the first quarter related to softness in volume, so you're correct. Operator : And your next question is from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Tracey, you talked about sort of the significant cash balance that you guys have. And the cash flow was very strong in the quarter and it looks as though working capital could be nicely favorable over the course of the year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of your attitude in terms of looking at the dividend increase, in terms of your ability to really ratchet up the cash return to shareholders as you get what could be, let's say, a 20%, 30% increase in free cash flow this year? Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes. I think that's a great question. So we demonstrated that last year. As our cash flow, our free cash flow increased during the course of the year, we increased our share repurchase activity. So we have, over the last few years, had a good mix of both dividend increase as well as share repurchase increases. And certainly, to the extent that we expect to continue to improve working capital this year, we would increase our share repurchase activity. As I believe I stated on the last call, similar to prior years, we are looking at redeploying our free cash flow into dividends and share repurchase. We announced an increase of the dividend this morning, and certainly this year, our repurchase activity will increase as our free cash flow increases. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : A lot of your competition is non-U.S. based, so they get the currency tailwind while you have to deal with the headwind. So I'm kind of curious how that potentially impacts your marketing and spending plans for the year. Fabrizio Freda : So we plan to continue investing in marketing and activities for the year. That's the reason why we are adjusting our estimates in EPS, is exactly to make sure that short-term issues will not impact what we believe are long-term investments. And so we will -- this fiscal year, we expect our marketing investment to be ahead of the previous year in absolute terms and to remain more or less stable in term of percentages. And the reason why the percentages will remain stable is also because the amount -- the growth on our known advertised brands or on our brands with lower level of advertising like the La Mer, the M-A-C in our portfolio, is obviously stronger than the growth on our heavy advertised brands like Lauder and Clinique. And so there is a mixed reason why the percentage remains stable but the actual level of spending is expected to increase. And we believe this investment will drive growth for the medium and the long term. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just a couple questions. For the second quarter, have you tried to sort of -- can you tell us what the difference is between shipments and consumption in your guidance? And then I have a follow-up. Tracey Thomas Travis : Between shipments and retail? Fabrizio Freda : Retail will be ahead of shipments. Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes, yes. So and we had a little bit of the reverse in the first quarter. And I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect that, that will cure itself in the second quarter, which is part of the reason for the guidance that we provided in the second quarter. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And the 2 markets where the retail will definitely be ahead of shipments, in our assumptions, is travel retail in the U.S. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I have a couple questions. Fabrizio, just a point of clarification on the U.S., you mentioned sort of pressures on your brick-and-mortar customers. Just to be clear, you mean by that, department stores? Or are you also saying that some of the special retailers, the growth in those channels has slowed somewhat? And then my second question really relates to, now that SMI is complete, really, are there perhaps opportunities for you to accelerates some other productivity initiatives that you've been working on to offset some of these weaker macro trends? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. So yes, I was referring to our business in department stores. That's where we have been challenged and we are going to improve our plans and work to go back to stronger growth. But I was referring to our business in brick-and-mortar department stores, not in specialty, which continues to grow very well. Also, the business in free-standing stores continue to work strongly, the business online continue to work strongly, and that's the picture in the U.S. Tracey Thomas Travis : And as it relates to SMI, you're correct. We finished the group 4 implementation in August, so we went live in July. The hyper care, this time, was the shortest that we've had. So again, flawless execution by the team, as Fabrizio mentioned. The team, along with many others in the organization, really throughout the globe, are now focused on SMI value realization. We've combined what had been our former cost savings efforts and initiatives which was a separate group from the SMI group into one group. They're focused on leveraging the capabilities that we have gained in SMI from process and system, the additional visibility to information that we have gained and really leveraging that to drive cost savings opportunities in the biggest areas of opportunity, which I outlined in our prepared remarks. The focus for us is on continuous cost improvement. So it's not a program, it's actually a habit going forward. And as we have spoken about in the last few calls, when we look over the next few years in terms of where margin expansion will occur, we expect less in terms of gross profit margin, more in terms of the expense areas. So this is a strategic enabler for us and it is terrific to be able to now leverage this tool over the next few years. We actually, for this year, given some of the softness that we've seen, have identified incremental cost savings over and above the cost savings that we had embedded into our plan and into the guidance for this year as an example. Fabrizio Freda : And the reason why we've done is to defend the marketing investment. That's the key point. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Megan Cody - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : This is actually Megan Cody calling in on behalf of Steve. Just one question that we had was what -- how much macro non-currency deceleration was baked into your prior guidance versus now? Tracey Thomas Travis : Macro non-currency? Megan Cody - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes. So like you guys obviously upped your FX headwind, but kind of since you brought down on your constant currency sales growth guidance, what kind of non-currency-related headwinds do you have baked in there? Tracey Thomas Travis : So in terms of our updated guidance, about half of it was related to currency and about half of it was related to the macro issues that we outlined for you in the prepared remarks. So it's about half and half. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. That was the question, half currency, half Hong Kong, mainly. On the other half, that is not currency, a big, big percentage was the Hong Kong, Chinese part. Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes, right. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Can you guys just give a little more detail on, on an x-SAP shift basis, why were profits in the Americas down as much as they were, down 29%? And I guess, and I'm sorry if you said this already but, Fabrizio, where in the Americas exactly will shipments lag consumption into next quarter? Tracey Thomas Travis : So the Americas sales, as you saw from our press release, were actually flat. So that is difficult to -- even though, certainly there were costs actions that were taken, it's hard to offset flat earnings. And Latin America was up, the U.S. was slightly down and that's how we netted out in terms of flat sales. So that's the reason why we have a deleverage in the Americas. We did, as Fabrizio mentioned, protect some of our marketing spend and some of the critical initiative investments like R&D that we're making in the organization. And in terms of the -- where you're going to see the shipments lag the retail, really in the U.S. Fabrizio Freda : In travel retail. Tracey Thomas Travis : In travel retail, yes. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I have follow-up questions about the second half of the year. If I use the upper end of your guidance and adjust out the SMI shifts, it looks like you're projecting second half earnings up 15%. So I'm trying to factor in what gets better? You already said that you expect Hong Kong to return to normal. Do you expect -- you said on travel retail that you're losing share now but expect to gain share ahead. Are you -- does your guidance bake in share gains returning in travel retail in the second half? And also, on the Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands in the U.S., does your guidance assume that those brands resume growth in the second half in the U.S. or maybe just lesser declines? Fabrizio Freda : So yes, let's start from the U.S. What is in our -- again, Alice, we will try to remake your calculations to see what you said. That's not exactly the way we see it, but we will see. But anyway, your point is right, anyway. We need to have a much better performance in the second 6 months versus the base. As I said, we have an easier base. The second point I want to make on the overall is that although the majority of the growth of profit will need to come in the second 6 months, the absolute level of profit is the large majority is in the first 6 months. So if you look at the numbers, you will see that 60%, 65% of the absolute profit will be delivered in July-December. And only about a bit less than 40% or the profit will be delivered in the January-/June. So we have much more investment and cost flexibility to deliver the profit in the second 6 months than what we had in the first 6 months. Just as a general statement that explain, I hope, clearly why we have the confidence that we have. The second point is what should go better. I think many things should go better. As Tracey already explained, we assume that we will not have in the second semester the same Hong Kong issues that we have in the first -- in the second quarter. Second, we are assuming that in the U.S., we will deliver a better trend. How this will be composed? Will be composed by continued outstanding business on our M-A-C and on our luxury brands, on our rest of the world portfolio and stabilization or slight improvement versus stabilization on Lauder and Clinique. So not a huge assumption, but a reasonable assumption of our 2 biggest U.S. brands, while the rest of the portfolio, which is doing outstanding, is assumed to continue to do outstanding. Then there is a continuous improvement in the traveling corridors because, again, the base is different in the second 6 months and because there are many activity in travel retail that we are doing that we expect to make, as I said in my prepared remark, to make travel retail to go again above traffic. And that's the key goal and what is in our assumption. Third and last -- or fourth and last, what is in our assumption is the delivery of the cost saving opportunities that Tracey has commented on that obviously we have started. Don't forget that July is when we went live. So we have started many of the savings as soon as we can, but more of them will impact the second 6 months of the year, of the one that could impact the first 6 months of the year. Operator : We have time for one more question, and your last question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Two questions. One, I wanted to revisit the China commentary about the slowdown and then the share gains in the masstige. I'm curious how you quantify the impact from some of those companies that are doing it, particularly given the long-term growth expectations from one of the larger Korean companies over the coming years. So do you know what you need to do to offer competing brands to retake share or to sort of stem what seems to be coming? And then secondly, just go back to Hong Kong. So some of your large prestige beauty competitors didn't call it out. I guess I'm curious like, is there something within your business that's a little bit different than theirs? Do you have more retail doors? Or is there some sort of more online presence, more department store presence for one versus the other, maybe some sort of quantification there would be helpful Fabrizio Freda : Let me start from Hong Kong. Again, as we said in our prepared remarks, the real big impact in Hong Kong started end September, early October. So in the course that we saw the initial softening, in fact, we were in July-September, stable in Hong Kong. But is -- our estimate is the impact that it will have on our business in the entire quarter. Our estimate is based in what we have seen in the month of October during the protest. So this is an estimate, and I cannot comment on why a competitor didn't bring it up. It is an estimate based on an October observation, which, by the way, was not the first quarter. I think we made it very clear in our report. The second thing is yes, we have a very big business in Hong Kong. We have a very high market share of Hong Kong. And because our business is also so strong in Mainland China, half of the Hong Kong business is done by Chinese and so also the market share of the Chinese that come in is very high. So as a concept, we have a very high market share in Hong Kong. And if Hong Kong get a cold, we get a bigger cold than many of our competitors and there are other parts of the world that if that part of the world get a cold, our competitor get a bigger flu. So it's a matter of market share in certain areas. By the way, we are very happy to have a very high market share in Hong Kong because it's a super market for the long term and we actually protect our market share with the appropriate investment in the short term because again, we are there for the long term. Answering your second question is Korea and Korean trends. First of all, let me say that I would like to say that we have been seeing this coming since a long time. You heard me speaking about Korean trends as a big idea in the market since a long time. So we have -- we recognize Korean trends. The fact that Korea is becoming an exporter of pop culture and trends in the Asian region and possibly around the rest of the world over time. The same way we have recognized for years when trends were coming from America and we have brought many brilliant American trends, or Californian trends, like our Smashbox brand does every day, to the rest of the world or French trends or Italian trends or even British trends, with our Jo Malone brand. So we are able to recognize trends when they are, wherever they come. And the way to compete with these Korean trends reality is actually to embrace them and to bring them around the world. Our brands, Clinique namely, has been one of the first brands in prestige bringing the BB creams and CC creams to the U.S., which is actually a Korean trend. And today, Smashbox and Clinique are a very high market share of BB and CC in this market in the U.S. And there are more trends that M-A-C has brought around the world on Korean looks. And by the way, this is one of the key idea behind M-A-C's success in Asia is the embracing of Korean looks of this brand, which is done fantastically well with amazing creativity. So that's the first part of the answer is that our brand are embracing Korean trends. The proof that we are doing this well is that, as I just said, we are winning again in Korea. And the fact that the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is growing in Korea and that some of our brands, makeup brands like M-A-C or other skincare brands, are winning big in Korea again means that we actually, on purpose, we have used our activities to learn how to compete with Korean brands, leveraging local relevant Korean trends in Korea so that we can then compete effectively in the rest of the world. The second part of your question was about Korean brands. Yes, there are some Korean brands, which are particularly successful generally in creating these mass masstige players that are also sourcing from us, particularly in China and in Korea. And yes, this is also a very interesting phenomenon. While the amount of competition in the luxury area for the moment is limited and obviously is big in Korea and limited in China and not yet present in the rest of the world. But I think we are ready to compete also with Korean brands in the future and we are prepared to manage these correctly. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Good, President of the U.K. and Ireland. Chris is going to discuss both the strategy and our current business in the area. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our expectations for the full fiscal year are before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 July implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, which would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our global business delivered strong financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Net sales rose more than 5% in local currency, better than we anticipated, and earnings per share also exceeded our forecast. Many of our brands, channels and countries contributed, and importantly, we expect this momentum will accelerate in the second half of our fiscal year due to the strength of our upcoming launch calendar. Prestige beauty continues to grow, sustained in part by heavy spending by key companies and occurred against the backdrop of increasing volatile macro events, including sharp currency fluctuations, political unrest and slower growth in some countries. We continue to invest in the future by acquiring 4 prestige brands that position us well for our sustained growth and profitability. I will start to discuss these acquisitions later on. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrated our strategy is working, since we were able to deliver solid performance when faced with market challenges and currency volatility. This is also a testament to our talent and the flexibility we have built into our business model to create resilience and agility. We are able to quickly adapt and change our focus when we see consumers and market dynamics shifting. Our consistent success is rooted in our multiple engines of growth, which has been -- which has enabled us to find opportunities across geographies, channels, consumer demographic, brands, innovation and acquisitions. We have strategically broadened our reach, so when the unexpected occurs, we are less exposed and have more positive levers to pull. Our strength in the second quarter was led by many of our prominent growth engines. Our luxury and makeup brands were standouts, which continued a recent pattern. We enjoyed excellent double-digit growth in the U.K. and most emerging markets, and by channel, in our own lines, specialty-multi and freestanding stores. Sales rose in most product categories. Skin care, our largest, was supported by recent launches, including Clinique Smart Custom-Repair Serum, which climbed to the #2 position in prestige serums in the United States. Clinique Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush also performed well and is gaining momentum globally. It's a strong seller in travel retail, and in key Asian markets it has overtaken its main competitor to become the bestseller device. Throughout December, we estimate that nearly half of all North America consumers who purchased the brush also brought at least one of the Clinique 3-Steps products. The brush is part of Clinique's strategically important 3-Step cleansing system and reinforces its authority in this area. In other skin care news, Est\u00e9e Lauder luxury Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Dual Infusion has been well received and soon will be paired with the new lifting cream. We have had good consumer acceptance the Re-Nutriv franchise, strengthening the brand in the high-end segment of skin care. Our makeup momentum continued and we generated strong sales growth, most evident in our 3 makeup-oriented brands.  M\u00b7A\u00b7C sustained its fantastic brand, with growth in all regions and notably in many emerging markets, including China, Brazil, Turkey. Its Holiday kits sold out in North America, and business in its freestanding store worldwide was brisk. Smashbox growth was also stellar, thanks to strong retail in specialty-multi and online, expanded global distribution and popular new palettes. Within makeup, our brands are significant players in the key subcategory of foundations. One of the highest loyalty products, Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation Stick and Est\u00e9e Lauder Perfectionist and Double Wear products were bestsellers. Beyond Perfecting, Clinique's newest liquid foundation, incorporates concealer and is beginning to launch in the stores now. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand makeup business climbed high single digits globally, driven also by its usually popular Pure Color Envy lip franchise. Also in the lip category, we expect the spring launch of Clinique Pop Lip Colour and Primer to generate excitement. In fragrance, sales declined against heavy launch activity in the previous year period. However, our luxury scents from Jo Malone and Tom Ford continue to rise sharp double digits, and we had a nice lift from our successful Michael Kors Collection.  In hair care, Bumble and bumble generated strong U.S. sales and has 2 exciting hair care products launching this fiscal year that we expect to boost its salon business. As you see, there is a great deal of product excitement across the portfolio that we believe will contribute to accelerate in sales in the second half. We also continued to drive sales from several high-growth channels. Our e- and m-commerce business rose more than 30% in the holiday quarter with double-digit increases on brand and retailer sites, and even larger gains on third-party sites. Also impressive is that nearly 1/3 of the sales came through mobile devices. Importantly, all metrics, traffic, conversion and orders increased over last year. The lion's share of our company's e-commerce business comes from the U.S. and the U.K., and our second quarter sales in each country surpassed the market's overall online growth. The largest market for e-commerce in the world is China, and we are making good progress there as well. We have now 6 brands online in China and their combined online sales increased nearly 200%. We have tremendous opportunities to expand our online footprint by brand and country around the world. Our midsized brands are growing in importance to the company overall, and this is also true in travel retail. Aveda, Jo Malone, La Mer, Tom Ford accounted for much of the 4% increase in retail sales in the travel channel. Our net sales in travel retail declined approximately 4% because retailers rebalanced inventories. Additionally, the Chinese New Year holiday is later this year, moving the shipment [ph] to the third quarter. Sharp currency moves and political unrest in part of the world has a curtailed travel and has affected groups that had large purchases of beauty products, including Russians, Brazilians and Chinese. A bright spot was Japan, where travelers took advantage of a weak yen and we had strong retail growth. Another positive factor is our continued expansion in the channel. We opened more airport door for certain brands, which are generating good growth. From a geographic standpoint, we tailor our product and resources to where we see the best growth prospects. We continue to believe China is one of the most exciting opportunities and will remain a key growth driver over the next decade. China's prestige beauty growth remains at high single digits, and we see wide space opportunity to enter additional cities, doors and channels and launch more brands. Our net sales in China rose 4% in the quarter. We were competitive promotionally, and our retail sales climbed 15% with virtually all brands rising double digits. Est\u00e9e Lauder, the leading prestige beauty brand in the market, had a terrific performance, especially in December, when retail sales rose sharply and it widely outperforms the industry. We expect its positive retail trends to continue for the rest of the fiscal year. Chinese consumers are passionate about beauty products and branching out beyond skin care. M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Bobbi Brown, Tom Ford and Jo Malone had fantastic results, pointing to higher makeup and fragrance consumption in that market. M\u00b7A\u00b7C emphasized Korean beauty trends that are popular throughout Asia, sending its sales up sharply. Emerging markets beyond China had been helping to drive our consistent growth as our compass predicted. The group, which includes Brazil or India, maintained its healthy momentum at 25%. Our business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were strong. Net sales growth in constant currency in Western Europe rose mid-single digit. And we estimate we gained share in Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Benelux and Nordic region. Emerging markets there grew more than 20%, driven by Russia, the Middle East and Turkey. The U.K. has done a phenomenal job embracing the company's strategy with outstanding execution, strategic innovation and local relevance. There are many lessons we had learned in the U.K. that are applicable to other markets. We should foster future gains around the world. Chris will elaborate shortly. Our net sales in Hong Kong declined slightly as protests and tensions impacted retail traffic. But our results were better than we had anticipated. Although spending by tourist is expected to remain low, we anticipate a return to growth in the second half as political unrest abates. Our sales grew modestly in Korea, although local brands continued to gain share. We are encouraged that the number of our brands, including Aveda, Origins, La Femme [ph] -- or Jo Malone are accelerating in some heritage brands, assuring signs of recovery. In addition, we successfully launched Tom Ford Beauty in Korea with very strong demand. Retail sales of prestige beauty improved in the U.S.A. A trend led by many of our brands, the holiday period was promotional for all prestige beauty, culminating in a strong retail showing for the month of December. The consumer sought value and responded well to our holiday programs that were popular across brands and channels. We expect sales to accelerate in the U.S. in the second half, reflecting a strong launch calendar and marketing activities. We are working to extend our scope by reaching new consumers demographics. And one of our most exciting initiatives comes from the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, which signed 19-year-old Kendall Jenner as a spokesmodel. Kendall is star in social media and has a huge built-in audience with over 18 million followers on Instagram. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand remains focused on its core consumers as evidenced by innovation into luxury and anti-age business. However, at the same time, it is taking steps to broaden its appeal and be disruptive in a way that will draw the attention of a new generation. Our namesake brand has other exciting announcement and launches planned and it tries to attract more influencers and millennials. Now I'd like to update you on the newness brand in our portfolio. Each one we recently acquired has a unique position in the fast-growing area of prestige beauty. RODIN olio lusso in oils, Le Labo in high-end fragrances and sensory body products as we discussed last quarter. More recently, we added GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand focused on fast-acting facial masks with a robust presence in specialty-multi channels. And Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, which offers a collection of luxury fragrances crafted by some of the world's most talented perfumers. Over the years, we have acquired many small brands that today are formidable global competitors in the prestige beauty space. Our creative and operational strengths position us well to develop this next collection of brands into more sizable brands for the future. We warmly welcome the brands and their entrepreneurial founders into the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies family. We look forward to accelerating the momentum of each of the brands by leveraging its strengths, and together, we will develop their potential. These brands are being overseen by 2 talented executives, who bring complementary skills and intimate knowledge to our company. Caroline Geerlings, who most recently head the Tom Ford Beauty, is focused on commercializing the brands and their operations. Daria Myers, who has extensive brand and R&D experience oversees innovation, product development and creative initiatives. Both executives report to Group President, John Demsey. Our long-term strategy emphasizes our many pillars of strengths, including a strong bench of talented leaders, diverse brand portfolio, balanced geographic presence, and most importantly, multiple engines of growth highlighted in our compass. We are committed to strengthening our robust growth levers, finding new ones and continue our journey to keep delivering sustainable profitable growth. With a solid first half behind us and exciting programs ahead, we are confident we can execute against the global challenges and risks we may face, and deliver another year of above-industry constant currency growth. I want to thank all our talented employees who contributed to our excellent performance throughout their collaborative spirit and dedication and ability to steer through many volatile environments. Now I will turn the call over to Chris, to talk about our fantastic U.K. business, which on a local level mirrors the terrific global collaboration and execution I just discussed. Chris? Chris Good : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I am delighted to be here. I have been with Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies for 15 years in a variety of leadership roles in Asia and Europe, and for the past 3 years as President of the U.K. and Ireland. The U.K. was the first market to be opened by the company outside North America in 1960, and indeed, it remains our second largest market after the U.S., representing more than 8% of total company sales and an even greater share of profits. Fabrizio spoke of the company's multiple areas of growth and the U.K. is one of our largest engines. Our company is #1 in prestige beauty in the U.K. and #2 in total beauty, which includes mass. The U.K. business is large, complex and has a very different distributional profile from Continental Europe. Many would view the U.K. business as mature. Average growth for total beauty has hovered between 3% and 5% for the last few years, with prestige beauty growing at approximately 5% on average. However, we view our U.K. business as an emerging market. What we mean by this is that we pursue high-growth opportunities across geographies, channels, categories and consumer segments. This approach has resulted in 3 years of growth trending well above the market. Our net sales in constant currency grew 11% last year and we are currently up 13% for the first half of fiscal '15. Strong results in an economy with GDP growth of only 2.6%. The U.K. is one of the world's most diverse nations and a top tourist destination. We go to great lengths to offer the most ethnically appropriate mix of business at every counter. We ensure our staff in merchandising is well-suited to the consumers of each location. Our approach is also successful by product category. Prestige skin care is growing modestly across the U.K., but if you look at specific subcategories within skin care, there is good growth to be had if you have the right product and the right targeting. For example, masks are a high-growth subcategory where we are a leader. Origins has the #1 rank in prestige masks in the U.K. Cr\u00e8me de la Mer has jumped up to #3, following the launch of its Intensive Revitalizing Mask and Lifting and Firming Mask, with its masks sales quadrupling in value. Our brands combined show a growth of plus 28% for the first half in masks, more than double the prestige growth. In fragrance, our best performance this year had been the luxury brands Jo Malone and Tom Ford, which both grew at over 20% against prestige fragrance as a whole at 3%. This bodes well for the new acquisitions of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and Le Labo, where we are poised to take advantage of the U.K. consumers' strong appetite for luxury fragrance. A further area that illustrates our granular approach is our distribution. We have continued to expand our freestanding stores into new areas, including major transportation hubs. M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Jo Malone stores opened at St Pancras International train station, and both are now trading ahead of plan. Further opportunities exist for distribution in areas that might not be the most obvious choice, but quickly prove their worth. The new Jo Malone freestanding store in the popular tourist golfing destination of St Andrews in Scotland is an example. We have also had success with new formats, such as pop-up stores, to test and learn in new locations. Example is a Jo Malone in Brown Thomas in Dublin and Clinique in London's Covent Garden. Our well-balanced portfolio brand is helping drive growth. We've had solid single-digit growth from our heritage brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. Clinique is the #1 brand in the U.K. and continues to resonate with consumers. The brands new launches, Smart Serum and the Sonic System, propelled facial skin care growth of 10% retail during the first 6 months. The heritage brands are fortified by strong double-digit sales growth of M\u00b7A\u00b7C as well as the next tier of brands such as Jo Malone and Bobbi Brown. And this, the next tier, including Tom Ford, Smashbox and Bumble and bumble are all demonstrating well above industry growth rates. This balanced portfolio of brands at different phases of their evolution allows us to continue to grow at above average rates overall. For this reason, we are very excited about our latest acquisitions, which have tremendous potential. The U.K. has a successful history of growing new acquisitions. When we bought Jo Malone 15 years ago, it had just 2 locations in the U.K. Today, it has 53 stores and counters and is the fastest-growing fragrance brand in the top 5. Throughout our business, we deliver High-Touch at everything we do. We have 7,500 dedicated sales representatives at retail and our freestanding stores, bringing High-Touch services to the consumer. I believe that in this era where a consumer can get whatever she wants, whenever she wants it, the brands that can provide unparalleled service are best positioned to grow. The U.K. has a higher percentage of mobile shoppers than any other European country and we have made great strides. All our brands in the U.K. have mobile sites. According to a recent survey by industry think tank, L2, we have the top 5 mobile sites for beauty. Our reach-out growth for the second quarter was led by strong results from Jo Malone, M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Smashbox and Tom Ford, each of which saw sales rise 20% or more. The U.K. recorded its strongest ever Cyber Monday, with online sales up 46%. At Jo Malone, great demand for personalization such as the new online engraving service for cologne, candles and bath oils, boosted sales. While e-gift cards, click and collect and same-day delivery service in London strengthened the brands' omnichannel experience. We had strong results across our channels, with several growing digits. During the holiday season, online was a marked success with our own sites growing at 32% and retailer sites, 36%. The developing click-and-collect capabilities of many retailers are a key factor in their growth rates. In our own channels, we have also started to offer click-and-collect services for Jo Malone and Bobbi Brown, which helped drive for success and demonstrated our High-Touch approach to the consumer. Specialty-multi channel had healthy growth in the quarter, up more than 10%, led by Boots. As part of our strategy to expand brands in specialty-multi retailers as appropriate, Smashbox and Bumble and bumble brands expanded their presence in Boots. And our freestanding store channel was a huge success, growing at more than 30%. Department stores remained a key channel for us in both brick-and-mortar and online. We had solid growth overall and double digit sales gains in a number of our largest department store partners. Going forward, we remain optimistic about the macroeconomic situation in the U.K. and confident in the continued growth in prestige beauty. Thanks to our tremendous team in the U.K. and our proven ability to execute with excellence, we remain committed to pursuing the best opportunities to grow our business ahead of the industry and continue to be an important growth engine for the company overall. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. First, let me briefly review our fiscal 2015 second quarter results, and then I will share with you our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. Reported net sales for the second quarter grew 1% compared to the prior year and rose 5% in constant currency, exceeding the top end of our expectations. December sales accelerated beyond what we expected, driven by the strength of our holiday programs, as well as the results in Hong Kong being better than what we had anticipated, despite the disruption from the political protest. Our gross profit margin of 81.2% was 50 basis points above the prior year, primarily reflecting favorable manufacturing variances and foreign exchange. Operating expenses rose 140 basis points to 60.4% of sales. The largest driver of the increase was higher general and administrative cost of 150 basis points, primarily reflecting strategic investment and capabilities, such as R&D and information technology as well as our acquisition activities. Retail store expenses rose 40 basis points, reflecting the addition of almost 150 freestanding retail stores over the past year. Partially offsetting these increases was 60 basis points of favorability and advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses, due primarily to the mix impact from the strong growth of our lower advertisement brands as well as the cadence of major launch activities for our heritage brands. As a result, operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 20.8%. Earnings per share came in at $1.13, approximately $0.08 above the top end of our guidance range, up 3% from the prior year, due primarily to the impact of the better-than-expected holiday results and improved tax rates and the decision we took to shift some of our marketing investments to the second half of the fiscal year to support planned strong launch activity. EPS would've been $0.07 higher on a constant currency basis for the quarter, resulting in strong EPS growth of 10%. All elements of working capital continued to improve during the quarter, compared to the prior year. Inventory days to sell decreased by 15 days to 171, which was driven by a combination of both currency translation as well as improvements in service level. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we generated approximately $1 billion of cash from operating activities, a healthy increase of 27%, or $211 million, versus the prior year period, which is primarily due to the improvements we achieved in working capital. We reinvested $187 million in capital projects to support the business as we continued to primarily invest in customer-facing areas, such as counters and new retail stores to support our brand growth plans. And regarding return of capital stockholders, we also took the opportunity to accelerate our stock repurchase activity, deploying $479 million of cash to repurchase approximately 6.4 million shares of stock. This level was more than twice the amount we repurchased during the first half of last year. And as a result of the accelerated share repurchase activity that we began last year and are continuing this year, we have reduced our diluted shares outstanding by approximately 9 million shares from the prior year period, which has also contributed to our earnings per share growth. In addition to our share repurchase activity, we have also distributed $169 million in dividends to stockholders in the first half of this fiscal year, which was a 14% increase to the prior year's first half. Over the past 5 years, we have steadily increased the total amount of annual cash distributed to stockholders with steady increases in both our dividend rate and stock repurchase level in addition to delivering solid earnings growth. During the second quarter, we also completed the acquisitions of RODIN olio lusso and Le Labo, which we funded outside of our free cash flow with a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper. We are proud that our financial performance generates ample free cash flow to reinvest back into our business to fund growth, while at the same time, allowing us to continually increase our distribution of cash to our stockholders. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $500 million in short and long-term investments. As you are aware from our earlier remarks, we have again utilized our strong liquidity in the third quarter to acquire 2 additional brands, Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle -- Fabrizio says that much better -- and GLAMGLOW, and to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares and support our dividend program. We are well positioned to fund our new acquisitions with a combination of cash on hand and leverage as appropriate. Let me now turn to our outlook for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year. To provide additional clarity on our underlying business performance, my commentary for the full year continues to exclude the impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that shifted sales from the first quarter of fiscal 2015 into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our July rollout of SMI. As a reminder, the impact of that shift was $178 million in sales and $127 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.21 per share. Reported and adjusted results are also reflected in the press release you received this morning. As we complete the first half of this fiscal year, we do continue to expect global prestige beauty growth of 3% to 4% this year. However, we remain cautious with respect to the macro environment, given the high degree of political and economic uncertainty. So now let me walk you through our guidance for the year and try to clarify for you the expectations for our underlying business performance, the impact of currency headwinds we're experiencing and the initial impact of our acquisitions. In our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are reconfirming the range of our constant currency sales and EPS guidance. That means that our sales growth guidance for the fiscal 2015 full year remains at 5% to 6% in constant currency. The 4 acquisitions we've completed to date are relatively small today and are expected to contribute a combined incremental 40 basis points to sales growth this year, still within our full year guidance sales range. As you are all aware, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen since we provided guidance last quarter, and currency translation is now expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 4 percentage points, which equates to approximately $480 million in sales. Our estimate assumes current stock exchange rates for the remainder of the year of 1 13 for the euro, 1 51 for the pound and 1 18 for the yen. On a reported basis our sales growth guidance, including the negative currency impact, is 1% to 2%. Regarding earnings per share, we are also reconfirming our previous guidance for the full fiscal year in constant currency, and that growth expectation remains at 7% to 10%. This excludes the impact of negative currency translation on our earnings, which was a 4% negative sales impact equates to approximately $0.23. Therefore, our revised expectation for reported EPS, including the negative currency impact, is a range of $2.93 to $3.01, so an extra $0.10 from what we had expected last quarter. This compares to our fiscal 2014 EPS of $2.95 before charges and the accelerated orders. The impact of our acquisition is expected to dilute operating margin by approximately 40 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.06. We expect to manage the EPS impact of these acquisitions within our previous guidance range. Our sales in the third quarter are expected to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency or flat to last year on a reported basis due to the impact of the strong dollar. Contributing to the sales acceleration on a constant currency basis in the third quarter are : multiple new skin care and makeup launches from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, as Fabrizio mentioned, coupled with strong marketing support; 70 basis points of incremental growth from acquisitions; a recovery in Hong Kong; our return to more normalized growth in travel retail; and easier retail comparison in North America against the prior year's severe weather and late Easter; and an easier comparison in Venezuela now that we will anniversary the transition to SICAD II. As I mentioned earlier, the cadence of our launch activity is greater in the second half of the year, and we plan to increase marketing support for these launches at a level greater than sales growth in the quarter. Additionally, we expect approximately $0.02 dilution from acquisitions. Therefore, we anticipate the third quarter EPS will come in between $0.45 and $0.50. The approximately 6% to 7% negative currency impact on sales growth in the quarter equates to approximately $0.07 per share. The momentum we have experienced in our business in the first half of the year in markets like the U.K., which Chris shared with you, our emerging markets in EMEA and a powerful and resilient brand portfolio, which we have recently expanded, coupled with the strength and dedication of our global teams gives us the confidence that our strategy is working and that we will continue to manage well through these volatile times and achieve our long-term goals. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : First, just a shorter-term question. I think it's impressive that you're expecting improved growth in Q3 relative to Q2 on a like-for-like basis. And you walked through a couple of the key drivers just now, but which ones are trending better relative to your going-in expectations? Fabrizio Freda : Our business is accelerating. First thing, our Clinique and Lauder brand are accelerating. And in the third and fourth quarters, we are going to have some important launches with very solid advertising spending and support in some key regions of the world. So that's the key factor, one of the key factor for acceleration. The second is the continued growth of our midsize brands, that has continued to accelerate, and this also is acceleration in distribution around the world entering other markets. And then, the amazing performance of M\u00b7A\u00b7C, so that's on the brand side. And then, as we -- as Tracey just explained, we have an expectation of a recovery in Hong Kong. We have returned to normalized growth in travel retail that, as we explained, has been growing 4% in the second quarter, but the net was minus 4% because of adjustment of retailer stocks that we are expecting to be finished. So the combination of these factors, combined with a relatively easier base period for what Tracey explained like, for example, the very severe weather conditions in the United States, make us believe that we are going to accelerate our growth trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I have so many questions. I guess, 2 things, one was just on the acquisition math. I understand the 40 basis points drag, but was just curious if you're including transaction costs in that. And then the second thing was I know it's very early and it's just been announced, but Fabrizio, your perspective on how Macy's acquiring Bluemercury could impact your business? Are there brands that you currently distribute in Bluemercury that have less distribution in the U.S.? That sort of thing would be great. Tracey Travis : So Lauren, on the 40 basis points, yes, it includes transaction costs. It includes the performance of the acquisitions for the time that we've owned them, and it also includes our current preliminary estimate for purchase accounting, so it includes all of those things. Fabrizio Freda : And on Bluemercury, yes, I think your observation is correct. We have some brands, which are in Bluemercury, which have a lower distribution in the U.S., and they're doing very well within Bluemercury. So the plan that Macy's announced yesterday of expanding Bluemercury and to continue building their business the way they announced yesterday will be very favorable to our brands and to the distribution strategy of some of our high-end brands in the United States. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Guys, couple of things. One is -- I just wanted a little bit more clarification. On the one hand we hear about bullishness and acceleration, which is great. And on the other hand, I'm trying to understand how that translates to EPS because you're taking down basically by $0.10, as you said, the back half of the year -- I don't know your guidance -- but that's on top of a $0.08, $0.09 beat on the quarter. So it's kind of a bigger takedown on EPS than one would have expected from currency. So I want to understand kind of the bridge there a little bit more. And in that context, secondly, if you can talk a little bit more about your expectations in the rebound in Hong Kong and in China more broadly? When we were there visiting recently, we found that there was certainly a social unrest aspect to it. There's also a lot of discussion around the Chinese consumer trading down and that might be more secular. So I love your point of view about that, if possible, too, please. Tracey Travis : So on the first question in terms of our EPS guidance. We spoke about the fact that we did make a decision within the last quarter to shift some of our marketing funds into the third quarter, primarily, and some into the fourth quarter to support our second half launches, particularly for our heritage brands, given the some of the strength in those programs, so that's the piece of it. And then the other piece is from an EPS standpoint, within the range covering the dilution effect of the acquisitions. So those are the 2 pieces that are impacting that. Fabrizio Freda : And I just want to underline that there is a conscious decision to support our new innovation on Lauder and Clinique in a significant way because one of our priorities is to accelerate the growth trend of our Clinique and Lauder brands. And if we are able to do that, obviously, this will further improve our really strong brands as an overall company. Now to answer your second question is the -- so what is our expectation? Hong Kong, we expect to go back to growth, but we agree, and our expectation is not that we'll go back to the kind of growth that was there a couple of years ago. It is the fact that there is less traffic there than before in the stores of Chinese tourists. And it's the fact that these Chinese tourists are -- not trading down probably is not the right word, but the profile of the Chinese tourist, which is in this moment in Hong Kong, is less high end than they used to be. So because of this, we are prudently assuming that Hong Kong will go back to growth, but we are not assuming back to the kind of growth that was a few years ago. In terms of the Chinese having overall attitude to trade down, I don't think so. I think Chinese are just -- the high-end Chinese, which continue to spend well, are just changing their destinations. And it's true that Hong Kong so less of this kind of profile, but it's also true that places like Japan are seeing more than at places like London or Paris are seeing more solid travel of high-end Chinese in Europe is actually on an increasing trend. So Chinese consumer remains good travelers. They remain heavy spenders when they travel, remain very passionate, interested in beauty. And they remain interested in a very high-end prestige beauty products, but the destinations are switching and that's why what we were saying before, our agility and our ability to manage these traveling corridors in the best way and to evolve our traveling management, depending on how they travel, is a big strength. And I think you will see the results of this in the next months. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Constance Maneaty : So a couple of things. On the acquisitions, is the dilution limited to purchase accounting and will it last a quarter or 2? Or will it also stretch into next year? Then I have a question on China. Tracey Travis : Okay. So the purchase accounting is -- or the dilution is related to 3 things : One, are the deal acquisition costs, so those are onetime costs. They will not continue forward, obviously. The second is the -- just the operating performance of the combined acquisitions, which is small. And then the third piece is purchase accounting and right now we have an estimate for purchase accounting for a couple of the acquisitions we have not closed the purchase accounting yet, and you will certainly see all of that reflected in our 10-Q when we issue it later today. And that will continue forward, the purchase accounting impact. So -- but obviously, we have great expectations for the 4 brands. Chris talked about how excited he is to have them in his market and what he thinks the U.K. can do from an acceleration standpoint with the brands. So we would expect that dilution to mitigate over, certainly, into the next few years. Constance Maneaty : Okay. And then on China, I think you said sales rose 4%, but what did same-store sales do? Fabrizio Freda : You mean the same-door? Sorry, what is the question? Constance Maneaty : Yes, same-store sales growth in China. What did that do? Fabrizio Freda : Plus 4%. So the numbers in China this second quarter were plus 15% retail growth, plus 4% same-door retail growth and plus 4% net sales. Tracey Travis : A trend change from the first quarter. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, big acceleration for the previous quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, with the acceleration across all brands with a great performance of the biggest brand in prestige beauty in China, Est\u00e9e Lauder, and in acceleration all our midsize brands as well at the same time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment. Wendy Nicholson : On Asia, can you tell us what local currency sales in Asia would have been, excluding... Fabrizio Freda : We lost your first part of the sentence. Could you repeat? Wendy Nicholson : Sure. Sorry about that. Just following up on Asia. Number one, can you tell us what local currency sales growth in Asia would've been if you excluded the pressure from Hong Kong? And just to put that in the context of kind of your long-term revenue growth target of 6% to 8%, Asia has been trending -- I know it's very bumpy quarter-to-quarter, but it's been trending actually slower than your other regions. And I'm wondering your confidence, just long-term with the challenges in Korea, and you call out Taiwan and Singapore, all being weak. Does Asia go back to growing at the higher end of the other regions? Or are we in sort of permanent slowdown mode in Asia? And then my other question is, just going back to sort of your enthusiasm about Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder specifically. It's awesome that those brands are reaccelerating, but doesn't that put some margin pressure on you because that's where you advertise more heavily? So if can you talk about your confidence about your margin goals, given the fact that those brands are accelerating, that would be helpful, too. Tracey Travis : So let me start with Asia, Wendy. And thank you for those questions. In terms of APAC, excluding Hong Kong, APAC for the second quarter would have grown low single digits. Fabrizio Freda : Okay, so on Asia. It's the fact that in this moment, as we explained, Asia is not at the top growth of our -- it's for the reason you summarized, meaning Hong Kong is slow, China has slowed down on average, although we have an excellent quarter too. Korea is flattening and Japan is being in this recession environment. So it's a fact. Interestingly, one of our best-performing countries in Asia, and it's normally it is Australia and New Zealand. So yes, it's a fact that today Asia is in a moment of softness. Now, my point of view, our compass and our strategic work for the future will -- it counts on the fact that this will change. This -- Asia will be and know that will be volatile, will be up and down. This is a down moment. But Asia is a long-term opportunity and a very strong region in terms of projecting long-term growth. And the reason for that is obviously the huge increase of the middle-class, the growth of the prestige channel overall in these markets. The fact that we have deployed to Asia only a small percentage of our portfolio for the moment, the distribution opportunity which are in Asia. So when you look at the opportunity for growth and assumed a stabilization of political or economical turmoil, Asia is definitely continue to be a long-term opportunity. And as I said in my prepared remarks, China, particularly, continued to be a very important long-term opportunity for the company, and Chinese consumers, wherever they travel, particularly. Last, I don't want to meet the travel retail -- Asians are formidable travelers and they're very heavy spenders and travelers. So we really are going to drive the travel retail in China and Asia the best we can and we believe we continue to be a success story in the long term. Now your second question on Lauder and Clinique. Yes, we are speaking about acceleration, but to be clear, Lauder and Clinique today are growing less than the average of the company. And so our enthusiasm is just for the beginning of this acceleration. Frankly, more to come. And that's why we want to invest in making this happen because that will be the other important engine that we want to activate at this matching of stand. But as I said before, I'm very pleased to see that we are delivering an exciting growth ahead of the others of the industry, even if for the moment, the engines of Lauder and Clinique are not full speed. And so our intention is to bring these 2 engines full speed. Now when we will do this, I don't -- this will not be dilutive to our profit. Actually, Lauder and Clinique, combined, are profitable brands. It's a fact that we want to invest into these in advertising, but not to be confused with the other brands that are less advertised than Lauder and Clinique have cost in other areas of their P&L. So the overall profitability of Lauder and Clinique, the moment the 2 brands grow at the right level is definitely accretive to the profitability of the company. So it will be a very good thing. And that's why in our prepared remarks, we are saying that we continue to be comfortable with our long-term margin acceleration objectives. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : I actually did want to just pursue that margin conversation a little bit, because as you see these opportunities behind launches, how do we think about what your goals are coming off of what will be a very low-margin year because of SMI? I mean -- because of, yes, the transitions. Do you see maybe fiscal '16 being an unusually strong margin year? How much are you going to let flow to the earnings level versus invest behind these ideas? Fabrizio Freda : I'll let Tracey add what she wants to, but I want just to frame the point. I mean, we are trying to manage this company for the long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. And you see out there the amount of volatility and continuous changing environment and continuous competitive environment that we are facing. I believe that what we've built, meaning our agility and flexibility to respond to these external and internal challenges that we face in this long-term evolution, is a strength. And so in order to manage these strengths the best, we have given you our long-term objectives. And within that, we will be managing for optimization, depending on internal and external situations. So the mix of, as we said, mix of our brands, growth, leverage, ability, productivity improvement, combined with cost savings that come from SMI, that comes from many other opportunities that we are constantly working on. And the growth acceleration in the region and as -- and sorry, I should mention that China, the acceleration, already high profit channels that we're managing like travel retail, online, et cetera, this combination, we believe, will definitely deliver the long-term goals. How we will do it by quarter or by 6 months is the flexibility we are trying to preserve, to be able to leverage our key strengths, which is the agility to win in a very volatile world. Tracey? Tracey Travis : I think you said it well. The only thing I would add is we spoke a quarter or 2 ago about the program that we have established for the next few years on cost savings, and we have quite a structure around that. The team is delivering results in multiple areas, in direct procurement, returns, there's focus on obsolescence. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of the benefits that you're seeing from inventory and working capital is a result of on the efforts of the teams working together on really improving supply demand match and starting to bring, with increased service level, starting to bring inventory levels down. So more of that will be coming over the next few years and we certainly see a bigger year from an impact standpoint in fiscal '16. That is supporting, as Fabrizio mentioned, some of the investments that we're making in these other areas for long-term growth. So we are very pleased with the model we have, the combination of cost savings and investments for long-term growth. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Steib : Fabrizio, wanted to follow up on your comments regarding the performance in travel retail channel, if I may. It's been such a strong growth driver over the years. I think this quarter, you mentioned it was growing at about mid-single digits, a bit of a slowdown, but you expect it to return to more normal growth patterns going forward. I wonder what that confidence is based on. Is this based on innovation? Or are you expecting to gain share going forward? Fabrizio Freda : So we are gaining share in travel retail. In fact, the data on travel retail of retail, which are available to now at the first 9 months of the calendar '14. And in these 9 months, we continue to grow ahead of the market. So we continue to grow market share in travel retail. We plan to continue to grow market share in travel retail. The key drivers of that are the expansion of our brand portfolio, the continuous expansion of airport and opportunities and the growth in the existing high-traffic airports, which is driven mainly by increased conversion, meaning today, between 10% and 15% of the travelers buy anything. And so just 1 or 2 points increase in this conversion is a great growth opportunity. So the combination of these will provide growth. The amount of traffic in airports, which is the other factor we monitor, as you know, is growing. So this slowdown versus the traffic in this last period is not attributable, in my opinion, to any long-term trend. It's to a very specific situation and it's mix of travelers. Basically, it's not only we had been growing slightly below traffic, but entire industry has been growing. So we are still ahead of the industry. The industry is below traffic. The reason for that, the moment the traffic, which is -- the mix is changing and the increase of travelers are Americans and Europeans, and the decrease of travelers are Brazilian, Russian and Chinese, you understand that unfortunately, the level of growth in the selling, meaning in the conversion changes, so it's a temporary mix of travelers impact that makes that growth of the travel retail sales be slightly below the growth of traffic. As soon as the balance, the mix of travelers would again evolve, this will change again and I believe the conversion factor will push again, sales growth well ahead of traffic. Now we have a competitive strength in this area because we are the market leader of a both skin care and makeup combined. And we are, on the contrary, not the market leader in the fragrance part of the business. So when we have populations, which are very interested in makeup and skin care being the traveling -- sorry, the growing part of the traffic, we have an advantage. And that's why in our compass clearly show that we should be favored by the travel mix in the long term. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz : I have a couple of housekeeping questions and then a broader sort of question. The first is on FX impact. Is that transaction and translation? Or just translation? And then maybe, like sort of how you view your pricing versus if there's any pre-buy ahead of maybe some pricing and some mix to offset some of the currency hit? And then on the acquisition side, so the math is $40 million of sales, but it seems like based on your guidance for the EPS dilutions, it's a $33 million loss. So I'm just trying to figure out how that happened? And then the longer-term strategic question is : First, Greater China, if you included Hong Kong, Macau, travel retail and the mainland, what that would be as a percentage of sales? And then the implications. It sounds like wholesale prices in China might be going down because I guess there's some stuff going on with e-commerce where they waived the duty on products there. So do you think that shifts consumptions back to mainland and maybe away from some of the other faster-growing channels like travel retail? That would be really appreciated. I'm sorry for the long-winded question. Tracey Travis : No, that's fine, Bill. So let me start. In terms of the foreign exchange impact that we spoke about, both for the quarter and the year, we were speaking about translation impact. However, embedded, obviously, in our reported results is the impact of transaction foreign exchange. So I did mention that on cost to goods, we actually had a benefit in for -- transaction foreign exchange. And that is related to some of the favorable hedges that we have in place, which over time, will mitigate. But it is primarily the reported numbers that I gave you were translation numbers. As it relates to the acquisitions, again, there are 3 parts to that dilution effect for this year. A portion of it is onetime and that is the deal-related cost for 4 acquisitions. A portion of it is purchase accounting, and again, that is preliminary purchase accounting and we will certainly true that up in the next -- within the next quarter or so. And then a portion is the operating performance, a smaller portion is the operating performance of the acquisition, which should be accretive, certainly, at least the operating portion of the acquisitions accretive in the next year or so. The purchase accounting, because of the structure of the deal, is dilutive and will be dilutive, but not nearly as dilutive as this year. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. And on Hong Kong, China and this -- I would exclude the traveling, but Hong Kong, China is about 10% of our business. And the travelers is -- we don't look at it in this way because we look at travel retail via corridors. And wherever there are Chinese shoppers, there are also Korean, Japanese, and so it's very difficult to define any place Greater China. So -- but Hong Kong, China is about 10% and then obviously, that is a very interesting path of travel retail, which is attributable to traveling Chinese consumers. And we believe this, as I said, this remains a very big opportunity of growth for the long term and we have an extremely solid portfolio. We are the market leader in this segment. We have an amazing portfolio of brands, but we have not yet deployed to these group of people all our strengths. For example, we are not yet deployed also in new acquisitions. So the only changes or regulations in China, frankly, there are frequent evolution and changes. But I don't believe that in -- again, there will be an impact on travel retail and other winning channels like online. I personally believe that the online channels within China will continue to grow, just because the consumer habits and the consumer preference or the way they're shopping will continue to go in that direction and we are ready to gain market share all this time in that area. And travel retail, again, is the result of the passion of Chinese for traveling and for buying during their travel. And so even if the price differential had to go down, I still believe there will be a very interesting growth factor on traveling Chinese. Tracey Travis : And then I would just add, Fabrizio called out the results that we saw in the last quarter as China is accelerating in terms of performance. So I think in terms of what is going on now with e-commerce and the ports, we are not seeing an impact yet from any of that activity. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your last question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : A couple of questions, one on margins and one on top line. So I was a getting excited about your gross margin this quarter. I think it's the highest quarterly gross margin we have on history, at least for the last decade or so we have modeled. But Tracey, you took a little bit of it out -- the excitement out when you said there's hedge gains in there. So can you walk us through that gross margin, what's driving and how much of that benefit is transitory? And then secondly on top line, I love the enthusiasm behind your heritage brands, on Est\u00e9e and Clinique. It's hard to buy into some of that enthusiasm based on what we've been seeing in the U.S. or seeing and hearing about in terms of market share trends, the sluggish performance of which I think you once again called out in the press release this morning. So can you zoom in a little bit more on the U.S. and talk about the initiative you have to revitalize these 2 core brands in the U.S? Tracey Travis : So we're glad we squeezed you in as well. In terms of the gross profit margin, about 20 basis points of the 50 basis points that I spoke about was related to transaction -- foreign exchange transaction gains. And then the balance was related to manufacturing variances and a little bit of mix. So as you know, mix, category mix and geographic mix, has a big impact on our gross profit margins as does, obviously, the impact from pricing as well. So we certainly expect that we will continue to see benefits, but they will vary quarter-by-quarter, depending on our region mix and depending on our channel mix. But that's really -- that was the impact in the quarter specifically related to the transaction gain. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. And on the acceleration on the brands, given what you say you're seeing in the U.S., and only on Lauder and Clinique brands. First of all, our enthusiasm is for the beginning of an acceleration process. So I want to, again, be very clear, it's only the beginning of an improvement. And second part of our enthusiasm is for our belief in the programs, which are in front of us in the next 12, 18 months on these 2 brands. So we are enthusiastic about seeing early improvements and we are enthusiastic about the programs of the next 12, 18 months, and we understand, if you are not yet fully buying into it, and we need to prove it to you. The second thing we are enthusiastic is in the learning we are taking when we put these 2 brands in the condition to win, where we can show the strengths, which is in the heritage brands. Clinique and Lauder are among the best brands of the industry since a long time. And in fact, one of the things that was in the U.K. presentation, we show you what these brands can do when they are in the right distribution support initiative mode. So I'll ask also Chris to explain in a few moments what are the learning in the U.S. that we will actually transfer to other region, including the -- sorry, the learning in the U.K. that we will transfer to our regions, including the U.S., which is the other part of our belief in the future acceleration. Chris? Chris Good : Thank you, Fabrizio. Yes. Well, first and foremost, it's really about growing the consumer base. And in that sense, we've been working very hard on sourcing for mass, and we've seen great results in that area. And also specifically targeting many of the new consumer groups, like the multi-ethnic consumer and the growing emerging consumer in that area. Also broadening the breadth of product usage of our existing customers, so getting them to buy across the brands and across the portfolio. Playing the portfolio very strongly indeed because we have in the U.K. the 4 portfolio of brands, almost the 4 portfolio. Reaching consumers in the way that they want to shop, so really building upon and developing the omnichannel experience. And finally, and very importantly, executing with excellence the terrific innovation that the brands deliver for us. Fabrizio Freda : And in -- with these conditions implemented with the current innovation plan, Lauder and Clinique are growing mid-single digit in the U.K. as we speak, so even before the acceleration programs. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join for the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern time today through February 19. To hear a recording of the call, please dial (855) 859-2056, passcode 67722547. That concludes today's Est\u00e9e Lauder conference call.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2015 Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dennis McHenry [ph], President of ELC Online. Dennis [ph] will discuss our current online business as well as future opportunities. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our expectations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year are before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 due to the July implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, which would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our company delivered an excellent performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 with broad based gains across most brands, channels and regions. Our net sales rose a strong 8% in constant currency, exceeding the top end of our expectation by more than 1%. Sales levels and cost management drove our earnings per share, which climbed a robust 49% in constant currency, also surpassing our expectations. Importantly, we achieved these strong results despite some ongoing market challenges. One of the more difficult environment was Hong Kong where the expected recovery did not materialize due to continuing political protests and fewer travelers from Mainland China. Additional change in travel patterns caused by currency swings negatively impacted travel retail trends in a number of countries : Brazil, Russia, Turkey and Hong Kong in particular. Economic growth in the European region was largely improved. Through our focus initiatives, we outperformed the markets in the region and delivered robust gains. Thanks to the multiple growth engines we have developed and our proven ability to execute through many challenges, we expect the pace of our constant currency sales growth to continue in the fourth quarter. Our strengths will continue to be driven by both new launches as well as acceleration of compelling products and services that are already resonating worldwide. As fiscal year '15 draws to a close, recognizing the progress we have made, we are increasing our constant currency sales growth forecast to 6% to 7% for the full year. On the bottom line, we are raising the floor of our constant currency EPS guidance range, which increases our midpoint target. Also, our EPS guidance includes dilution from acquisition-related costs. We are using our better-than-expected profit this quarter in part for incremental investment in the fourth quarter. These investments will drive Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique's turnaround plan in the U.S. and support business-building capabilities. We also expect investment spending to continue to drive gains in some of our best-performing areas, including the U.K., Europe, China in our luxury brands. Additionally, M-A-C is accelerating freestanding store opening. The improving trends we saw in the third quarter give us the confidence to spend more in the final few months on initiatives that we expect to carry our momentum into fiscal year '16. Global prestige beauty is one of the most vibrant areas in the consumer product space. It has provided consistent annual growth, currently, mid-single digits. Some areas are growing significantly better than the others, so we are overemphasizing those. For example, some of the fastest-growing product areas are contouring treatments and kits, facial oils and masks, eye and lip makeup and high-end fragrances. Additionally, when consumers shop, they are increasingly attracted to e- and m-commerce, sites and freestanding stores. Geographically, we see significant opportunity in most emerging markets. Recently, Europe has begun to improve. And in the U.S., the makeup category is thriving. We are strategically positioned to win in each of these large, higher-growth areas by brand, product category, geography and channel, which led to our strong growth in the quarter, well ahead of the industry average. We believe we have just started tapping the potential in many of these areas, and we are finding ample room to drive our business. Our successful effort in developing a broader profile with multiple engines of growth and fashioning tomorrow's beauty trends were evident in our results. Even at the time when 2 of our biggest brands did not grow at acceptable levels in our largest market, the rest of our business more than compensated, fueling robust sales growth for the company. Our broad base portfolio is a clear strategic advantage. Brands such as M-A-C , Jo Malone London, Smashbox, Bobbi Brown or Tom Ford continue to be powerful engines of growth, generating double-digit sales gains. In fact, nearly half of our brands achieved at least 10% growth or more. In the U.S., the majority of our brands achieved a very strong performance. Many of our products are perennial bestsellers. We had growth across most channels with healthy retail sales in specialty multi, e-commerce and freestanding stores. Nonetheless, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique sales growth in the U.S. department stores lagged behind prestige beauty growth in the market. As you know, we have been working to reignite [ph] stronger growth in these brands, and we have new exciting programs being deployed now and over the next 12 to 18 months. Clinique is taking a holistic approach. Its major launches earlier this fiscal year were successful higher-priced skincare products. And now the brand is also emphasizing its sizable makeup business in the U.S. and seeing encouraging results. For consumers, makeup provides instant gratification and fresh new looks. For Clinique, it offers more exciting opportunity for entry-priced products, which attracts millennial and fits with the brand's heritage positioning. Clinique's spring makeup launches are in the important subcategories of foundation and lipstick. Launched in February, Beyond Perfecting foundation and concealer is helping to drive the entire makeup category for Clinique, which grew, again, in the U.S. in the quarter. Clinique is #1 in foundation in its home market. The brand's other exciting makeup launch, Clinique Pop Lip Colour and Primer, features an accessible price point and a case that displays the color inside. Clinique has bet its newest product will further accelerate its lipstick sales, which are projected to be up double digit in the U.S. this fiscal year. In both skincare and makeup, Clinique is launching products that play to its strengths and reinforces leadership in key subcategories. One important area for the brand is moisturizers where it holds the leading position in prestige beauty in North America. To further strengthen its authority, Clinique is launching this fall its first cream in its best-selling Dramatically Different Moisturizing line by adding a formula geared to consumer with dry skin. The new cream should generate incremental sales in its powerful core franchise. We believe the brand is beginning to attract more millennials through this new makeup and skincare products, and at the same time, it is engaging consumers with fresh advertising, communication, in-store merchandising and new services. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is modernizing its image and reaching out to a wider demographic while continuing to serve its core consumer with significant new products. It has had successful this year with several makeup products and expect this trend to continue with Kendall Jenner, the brand's millennial spokesmodel. In the fall, Kendall will appear in digital, print and TV advertising for an exciting new fragrance called MODERN MUSE LE ROUGE, which expands the inspirational concept behind the Modern Muse franchise. She will also promote upcoming makeup products, which we'll be discussing during our next call. Makeup and fragrance are good recruiting category for younger consumer. The most exciting development at Est\u00e9e Lauder in its -- is its next major launch. A new franchise of transformative product that creates visible definition for a beautiful, more contoured-looking face, which is an important new beauty trend. Named New Dimension, the collection includes a concentrated serum, a liquid tape precision treatment and contour kits for face and eyes. The actress Eva Mendes will be the face of this new skin care product in digital, TV and print advertising. New Dimension is targeted to global consumers of multiple ages and ethnicities. The line launches in North America in July followed by international markets in September and additional products will roll out later in the year. We expect New Dimension to create a new subcategory for Est\u00e9e Lauder brand for core consumers. Let me now discuss our total international business. We continue to successfully execute our emerging market growth strategy, which is progressing well. In total, local currency sales from all emerging markets, aside from China, climbed 29% with exceptional results in Brazil, Turkey and South Africa. In some markets, such as Russia, devaluated currencies reduced outbound travel, creating more local demand and sending sales up sharply. M-A-C is our largest brand in many emerging markets, including Brazil, Turkey or The Philippines. And a strong gains in these countries contributed to its stellar global growth. M-A-C is now available in more than 100 countries and territories, having entered 4 new markets only this quarter. China continues to be an area of strength for us. Our constant currency net sales climbed 14%, and most of our brands were up double digits. Although skin care remains the dominant category, makeup has seen rapid acceleration, allowing us to leverage our position as the worldwide leader in prestige makeup. Our total retail sales in China rose high single digit for the quarter, and we estimate we gained share overall. Sales increases were broad-based across our brands with several up double digits, including Clinique. Sales also rose in nearly all channels, including department stores, freestanding stores and Sephora. Today, Chinese consumers can buy our products in brick-and-mortar stores in 94 cities, 3 more than last quarter. The most rapid growth, however, was online where our business more than doubled. Our travel retail business improved despite several challenges. Retail sales climbed 7%, slightly higher than passenger traffic growth, which remained robust. The strongest retail gains were in Asia/Pacific led by Japan, which benefited from tourists attracted by the weak yen as well as Thailand or Australia. We believe we gained share in travel retail in calendar 2014 driven by accelerated growth in certain limited distribution brands and improving business in Europe, the Middle East & Africa. We continue to add distribution points and invest in the channel to help fuel our future growth. Online channel continued to show exceptional progress this quarter and is a key element of our long-term growth strategy. Our brands will benefit from the best-in-class capability we have established in this rapidly growing area from both retailer expansion and our continued brand size development. Dennis [ph] will discuss these exciting opportunities for e- and m-commerce. As we continue to demonstrate, we have significant growth drivers through our business and are particularly excited about the long-term potential of the 4 brands we recently acquired. We are integrating them into our operations and developing strategic plans for their future that started tapping into our capabilities in infrastructure to leverage their creativity and growth potential. During the quarter, we continue to improve our productivity, manage our expenses and delayed some planned investment spending until the fourth quarter to fuel new initiatives. Tracey will provide more detail. We are pleased with our results to date in fiscal 2015. We are confident we will achieve our full year targets even in the face of continued headwinds and remain optimistic about our long-term strategic direction. We are currently in the process of updating our compass, our 10-year view of the prestige beauty landscape that will provide insights to fuel our multiple engines of growth and propel our business forward. Our goal is to continue to generate superior top line growth, above the industry average and leverage that growth into increased profitability in order to enhance stockholder value. Now I will turn the call over to Dennis McHenry [ph] who has led the company highly successful and profitable Online division for the last 12 years. Under his leadership, e-commerce has grown from its infancy to a thriving business that will constitute approximately 8% of our company sales this year and an even greater portion, approximately 12%, in our most developed markets. Dennis [ph]? Unknown Executive : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. We have been a leader in online prestige beauty and consistently delivered outstanding growth year-after-year. Our compounded annual growth rate over the past 5 years was 25% with an accretive margin to the company. Our global technology platform, combined with the regional and local market execution, has allowed us to serve consumers at the local level with global business scale. The online beauty channel continues to grow, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Consumer preferences are shifting, and more and more people are comfortable shopping online and via mobile for beauty products. We are committed to bringing our High-Touch services online to meet those changing consumer needs. We were the first global prestige beauty company to go online with the Clinique brand in the U.S. in 1996. Today, we have more than 130 direct-to-consumer e- and m-commerce sites in 30 countries. Together with our marketing sites, we attract over 325 million online visitors globally each year. Our direct-to-consumer sites generate approximately 60% of our global online sales with retailer sites generate the remaining 40%. Both are contributing growth of over 25% a year. This year, we are seeing strong growth from retailer sites such as Nordstrom and Macy's in the United States, John Lewis Partners in the U.K. and Douglas in Europe. We greatly value our partnership with all of our retailers around the world. And together, we share best practices and explore ways to win in the growing online business and the new world of omni-channel. In aggregate, our online sales are expected to grow nearly 30% this year, an acceleration over our previous 5 years, with double-digit growth across all regions. North America accounts for approximately 65% of our sales. The U.S. is our most established market and often leads in experimentation of conversion-driving enhancements before they are rolled out to international sites. From the very beginning, we've been focused on bringing our signature High-Touch service from in-store to online. It is important to us that our consumers can engage with our beauty advisers and makeup artists along their digital shopping journey. Many of our brand sites feature live video chat with beauty advisers, integrated content in commerce, enhanced product browsing, photo uploads, skincare diagnostics, shoppable videos, auto replenishment and more. These enhancements not only support our mission to deliver our best High-Touch service to our consumers, they also successfully drive engagement and conversion to sales. Internationally, the U.K. is our second largest market, contributing approximately 15% of our global online sales, with particularly strong momentum from M-A-C, Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone and Clinique brand sites as well as a number of our important retail partners. Asia/Pacific, Europe and the Middle East & Africa and Latin America, which contribute the balance of our online sales, are collectively growing over 50% year-over-year. While many markets in these regions are relatively new entries for us and are currently small, they are experiencing high growth, and we are excited about their long-term potential. Emerging markets continue to be a key building block for our international growth. China is our third largest online market. We are on track to more than double our online sales in China this year. In addition to our 6 brand sites, we have 4 shop-in-shop sites on Tmall. Est\u00e9e Lauder is the #1 perceived beauty brand on Tmall, and we are excited that La Mer became our fourth brand on the platform a few weeks ago. All 4 of our brands on Tmall are greatly exceeding our expectations, and we plan to launch additional brands there in the near future. Virtually all of our brands are growing double digits online globally. We work closely with them to support product launches and ensure online is used as an engine to drive buzz, product information and sales. Beauty is one of the most active categories online with countless searches for products and how-to videos. Beyond our brand sites, we strive to remain active, relevant and innovative in social media in order to drive engagement. A terrific example is our I Love Makeup channel on YouTube, which features our company's products, makeup tutorials and video storytelling. It is the most subscribed beauty channel on YouTube of any brand with 30 million views. We are experiencing strong mobile growth with some markets generating more than half of their online sales from mobile phones and tablets. Across all regions, sales growth from mobile devices has greatly exceeded sales growth from PCs. To capitalize on the shift -- the consumer shift to mobile, we have expedited the launch of m-commerce sites around the world and have developed strong capabilities to win in the mobile space. Omni-channel is a strategic initiative for the company to enhance consumer shopping experience by allowing them to seamlessly move across channels. We're in the early stages of developing our omni-channel concepts. This quarter, we plan to launch omni-channel pilots with M-A-C and Origins' freestanding stores in the U.S. with more to follow in the U.K. and internationally then next fiscal year. We remain excited about the future of our online business. We have developed a strong business model for e- and m-commerce with winning capabilities and teams. For example, we're able to take our learnings from M-A-C and existing markets and use them to maximize our launch in new markets such as M-A-C in Brazil. We will continue to launch new markets, expand our brand distribution in existing online markets and win with our retail partners. As we continue to fuel growth in online and drive omni-channel initiatives, we believe we will seize significant opportunities ahead of us. In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues in the company and our retail partners worldwide for their continued partnership. I will now pass the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis : Thank you, Dennis [ph], and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2015 third quarter results and then share our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. My commentary excludes the impact of the Venezuela remeasurement charges that we recorded in both this quarter as well as the year ago quarter. Net sales for the third quarter grew 1% over the prior year and rose more than 8% in constant currency, above the top end of our expectations. Sales did accelerate sequentially from last quarter, as we expected, driven primarily by improved results in the U.S., Latin America, China and most of Europe and the Middle East. Our recent acquisitions contributed 50 basis points to sales growth this quarter. Our businesses in Hong Kong and travel retail continued to be softer than expected as Fabrizio noted earlier. Our gross profit margin of 80.5% was 10 basis points above the prior year period, primarily reflecting currency favorability of 20 basis points. Operating expenses improved 60 basis points to 64.9% of sales. The largest drivers of the decrease were 70 basis points of favorable selling and shipping expenses and 40 basis points of advertising, merchandising and sampling expense leverage, as we continue to experience faster growth from brands with less traditional advertising, and those brands have become a greater proportion of our total sales mix. Partially offsetting these improvements were increases in certain G&A expenses such as retail store operations and inventory -- information technology as well as acquisition-related fees. During the quarter, given a mixed retail environment in certain markets, including in part due to the severe winter weather conditions in the U.S., we were also more prudent during the quarter in some areas of our planned second half of the year spending, which contributed to the lower operating expense margin and which will also contribute to an acceleration in spending in Q4. As a result, operating margin rose 70 basis points to 15.6% in the quarter. Earnings per share came in at $0.72, approximately $0.22 above the top end of our guidance range, due primarily to better-than-expected sales and to the timing of certain investment spending in general and administrative costs. EPS would have been $0.10 higher on a constant currency basis for the quarter. All elements of working capital continued to improve during the quarter compared to the prior year. This was largely driven by continued progress in inventory days to sell, which decreased by 28 days to 164. The primary drivers of the improvement in inventory were a combination of favorable currency translation, supply chain process improvements and a favorable comparison to the preliminary SMI-related inventory build in the prior year. For the 9 months of this fiscal year, we generated approximately $1.4 billion of cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 18% or $216 million versus the prior year period, most of which is driven by working capital improvements. We invested $280 million in capital projects, largely in customer-facing areas such as counters and new retail stores to support our brands' growth plan. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisitions of GLAMGLOW and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, bringing the total paid-for-acquisition cost this fiscal year to $237 million, which we funded with a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper, leaving our free cash flow to be distributed back to stockholders. And regarding return of capital to stockholders, for the 9 months ended March 31, we deployed $626 million of cash to repurchase approximately 8 million shares of stock, reducing our diluted shares outstanding by approximately 7 million shares from the prior year period. We also distributed $260 million in dividends to stockholders, which was a 15% increase over the prior year period. We continue to expect to distribute approximately 100% of our free cash flow and share repurchases and dividends by the end of this fiscal year as another vehicle to enhance stockholder value. Let me now turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. My commentary for the full year continues to exclude the impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that shifted sales from the first quarter of fiscal 2015 into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our July rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift was 187 -- $178 million in sales and $127 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.21 per share, and it affects comparisons of both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. With 2 months to go to the end of our fiscal year and the momentum we built in the third quarter, we are raising our sales estimate and now expect sales growth for the full year of approximately 6% to 7% in constant currency. This includes 30 basis points from our recent acquisitions. The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen since we provided guidance last quarter, and currency translation is now expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 5 percentage points equal to $550 million in sales. Our estimate for the remainder of the year assumes 1.08 for the euro, 1.50 for the pound and 1.20 for the yen. Our sales growth guidance includes -- including the negative currency impact, is approximately 1% to 2%. We are narrowing our full year EPS range to $2.92 to $2.97. This compares to our fiscal 2014 EPS of $2.95 before charges and the accelerated orders. The 5% negative currency impact on sales equates to approximately $0.27 of earnings per share, $0.04 more than our last update. In constant currency, we are raising the low end of our range and maintaining the high end of our previous change. On this basis, EPS is expected to rise between 8% to 10% for the year. Our EPS guidance continues to include approximately $0.06 of dilution from acquisitions. Our sales in the fourth quarter are expected to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency or flat-to-down 1% on a reported basis. The strong constant currency sales growth in the fourth quarter is expected to come from new product launches from Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder in both skin care and makeup, as Fabrizio mentioned earlier; incremental growth from our previously announced acquisitions; continued acceleration of growth in North America; continued strong momentum from M-A-C and our other makeup brands; and an easier comparison in Japan against the past VAT increase of sales period in the prior year. We are very pleased with the overall course of our business thus far as we have managed through a tremendous amount of global market volatility by continuing to execute well against our strategy and by leveraging the strengths in our portfolio, creating accelerated momentum in the second half of the year versus the first half. We expect mid- to high-single-digit constant currency sales growth in the fourth quarter, and we are committed to reinvesting behind our strategic priorities. We plan to meaningfully increase investment in our fourth quarter behind both our current and upcoming product launches as well as to support accelerated door-opening activity, in particular for M-A-C. We also expect to continue our investments in building capability in areas such as information technology, R&D, digital marketing and human resources. Lastly, the fourth quarter will reflect $0.03 of acquisition-related activities. We anticipate fourth quarter EPS will come in between $0.27 and $0.32. The approximately 8% negative currency impact on sales growth in the quarter equates to approximately $0.10 per share. In closing, we are pleased with our team's ability to navigate major macro headwinds and deliver strong operating results, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver great results for this year as well as position ourselves for another strong year of growth in the next fiscal year. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess I was hoping you could start by just providing a little bit more clarification around that full year guidance. Because I understand the incremental FX headwinds, but in light of the large beat this quarter and the progress you seem to have made offsetting M&A dilution, the full year outlook basically implies you plan to reinvest the entirety back in the business in Q4. I know that was in part of timing decision, but as you alluded to -- because you alluded to it. But I guess, could you just talk more about where the investment will be targeted, and what type of return we should see? Because it's a little surprising not to see more of it flow -- more of a beat flow through it given the underlying top line strength. And then I guess while you're on the topic of guidance, I know the second part may have to wait until August for a full update. But FX seems to have taken a pretty big chunk out of your planned margin progression, again, based on this full year outlook. So I'm wondering how -- or wondering what kind of risk that poses to your longer-term target of 17.5% EBIT margins by fiscal '17 as you look forward. Tracey Thomas Travis : All right, Steve, great questions. So one of the things that we have done historically, and I think many of you recognize that, is -- in the fourth quarter, if we are having a good year and generating incremental savings, not only from our cost savings initiatives but also from the momentum of the business, we take the opportunity to invest behind some of the strong growth drivers that we have to not only end the year strong but also position ourselves for the upcoming fiscal year. So that is what we plan to do this year. So the fourth quarter investment is a combination of planned investment that we had targeted for -- in the second quarter that, if the third quarter was strong, we would reinvest back into the fourth quarter in those brands that are showing momentum. So that's a piece of it. And the other is, as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were a bit prudent in the third quarter, recognizing that we had some weather challenges in North America. And we were expecting an acceleration in sales. So we wanted to make sure that, that momentum occurred before we spent as heavily behind some of the marketing programs for the new product launches that we had in the third quarter. And obviously, the third quarter results that we just announced, support that. So the fourth quarter contains continuous support around the turnaround plans for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. We do have new product launches again in the third quarter, and we -- in the fourth quarter, and we'll be supporting both the launches we did in the third quarter as well as in the fourth quarter with that investment. We have additional investment supporting the momentum at M-A-C, Tom Ford and Jo Malone, again, in line with the tremendous growth that we've seen out of those brands this year. We did have a bit of a delay in some of the M-A-C store openings that we had planned in the third quarter, and we'll now have a fair amount of M-A-C store openings opening in the fourth quarter. So that's also putting some additional investment pressure on the fourth quarter. And then we'll continue to invest in some of the corporate capabilities that we have outlined for you all year. We have a ramp-up in spending in R&D, information technology, HR and in digital. So those are generally the areas. Regarding our outlook over the next couple of years, you're correct. We will, in August, update what the impact of foreign exchange has been on our long-term outlook. And Fabrizio, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. We will update that and you asked to get a sense of the situation. We have today, 0.4 point of margin. We should be fed [ph] by the acquisitions. I just want to clarify, this is going to be about 18 months in -- so it's not a long-term impact because the -- at the end, these acquisitions will be, over time, margin accretive, and the cost of the acquisition will be reabsorbed in 18 months. So the impact on currency that you are in, today is about 0.5 point, if currency -- if we had to go back to the currencies. And we are working internally to look at way in which to operate this with more savings or other activity that will probably -- we plan to work around this current currency situation. But anyway, the currency in the long term could also change again, so we don't know. And so we will come with a point of view in August on what is the right balance for the future. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Love to just discuss the online opportunity in China. It's still obviously -- it's #3, but it's still pretty small. And yet, in other categories, it's really massive. I'm just wondering what your view is on how big it could be over a 5- to 10-year period relative to the bricks-and-mortar business, if you could talk a little bit about that. And separately, in online, just to talk about how you plan to activate the New Dimensions. Is that -- did I get that right? Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes. Fabrizio Freda : So to answer the first question, I will like Dennis [ph] to say a few words. But today, we have 8% of our global business online. I hope you were impressed as much we are by the progress that's been done online and by the potential in the long term. In the countries, which are more developed like U.S., we have about 12% of our business, we believe that in China, China is -- could be 20% of our business in the long term being online the way the country is progressing, the way the other categories are progressing in this area. We're at the beginning of the journey in China where we are very well advanced in the U.S. I don't know, Dennis [ph], if you want to add anything. Unknown Executive : Yes. I think, first of all, we're pleased with the growth in China. We're going to more than double our business this year. We expect in the next few years that our business will be about 20-plus percent, as Fabrizio mentioned. It is a business that's quite new for us online in the market. And in the current quarter, it basically performed as well as the U.K. in terms of the size of the business. So it's become, essentially in this past quarter, equal to our #2 business and growing at triple digits. So we're very pleased. Fabrizio Freda : And on New Dimension, we are very excited about this new launch of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand. We believe that the contouring category is a new trend, so there are many, many consumers around the world which are enthusiastic about entering this category and experimenting what the experience can be. The product is excellent, does a fantastic job, so we have a great formula, and we have great plans. And I hope, as I explained in my prepared remarks, that we plan to start from the United States in July and then roll out internationally as of September, which is also clarifying the way we think of giving our best shot to accelerate the U.S. market. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It sounds like, on new products, that there's a decent size surge relative to recent years. So how do you think about the contribution from new products going forward, not only in Q4 but fiscal '16 as well? And then following on that, as you focus more efforts behind millennials, does that, in any way, impact how you think about contribution of price mix to the top line? Fabrizio Freda : So I'll take this one. So our -- the percentage of innovation as part of our sales -- every year percent of new product is increasing. We have done great progress in the last years, and we have increased this significantly slightly ahead of the market. And obviously, the more the acceleration of the industry is in makeup, the more, obviously, this is innovation intensive. Because makeup in term of number of product launch is more intensive than any other category. And so we are very well prepared. We will continue to be ahead of the industry average in terms of the ability to innovate, exercise creativity and launch new products. The -- however, how we are doing it, as I think I explained in my remarks, we are doing it analyzing the markets, analyzing what's big and what's growing the fastest. And third, anticipating and inventing new breakthrough areas. So the combination of focused innovation on what's big, what's growing and inventing the new is basically our program. And in total, this will constitute a continuing increase of innovation year-after-year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : You guys have been pretty upfront in terms of some of the pricing differentials related to China and travel retail over the past couple of years and how that's impacted your European business in particular. Can you talk a little bit about what you've seen in some of the other luxury categories in terms of some of the price changes out there? And is that something that you see entering the prestige beauty category going forward? Fabrizio Freda : I just noticed I didn't answer the previous question on pricing, which was the mix with the millennials. So I'll start from that -- is the fact -- the entry price point products are obviously more successful with the millennial at a high-end luxury. But this doesn't mean that the entry price point products are less profitable for us. So actually, the mix of entry price profit -- entry price product in prestige for us is a favorable mix. And so we don't see any pressure from this trend. On the contrary, it's a good trend. Now going back to the question on pricing versus our category. Now we have of your articulated pricing process and pricing strategy globally. We as a group or team internally measure price and price evolution, impact of currency changes and, obviously, what competition does around the world constantly. This has happened already since few years. And so we don't see any need of changing our strategy nor our processes. We just will continue to execute the process of amortization, the process of responding to currency changes, the process of responding to competitive needs and obviously, most importantly, to consumer desires. And we have -- and we'll continue in that direction like we have seen in the last year. So we don't see a big change, in other words. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I guess, Fabrizio, I wanted to go back to advertising in this particular quarter, right? So I guess coming into the quarter, you'd planned to increase ad support in the business, and the idea was that sales would accelerate on that increased support and better launches. So you got the sales lift, up 8% organic, which is good, but you got 40 basis points of ad leverage, which is, I think, very different than what everyone was looking for. So I guess I was hoping just for some insight into this, I mean, can you quantify how much was actually -- how much advertising was actually deferred into Q4? And was the brand mix so different, right, meaning the brands that require advertising grow faster. Was that mix so different from what you'd expected that you were able to get that growth on 40 basis points of advertising leverage? I'm just trying to look for -- a little more understanding on this will be helpful. Fabrizio Freda : Sure. And let me say first of all, yes, we are postponing some advertising to the fourth quarter, as Tracey explained. That's why -- let me refer to the total year because your comment anyway is correct. We have, in percentage, advertised leverage on the total year. Even if by quarter, this is assessed by [ph] swing where we invest more on the initiative, we choose to support more. But for the total year, this is absolutely a correct statement. Our absolute level of advertising is basically flat. But in percentage of sales, we are leveraging it. So why this is happening? First of all, within the advertising, there is a swing toward digital that has an impact, and in many countries today, is still a positive impact. Second, there is a fact that our traditional brand, which are typically more advertised, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, as you know are not the ones which are driving the growth the fastest. On the contrary, the fastest-growing brands such as M-A-C or Jo Malone or La Mer or Bobbi Brown are not advertised the traditional way. They're advertised more in digital, but most importantly, a lot of what we consider their marketing is in their freestanding stores and is in areas which -- where the cost is somewhere else, it's not on the advertising line. And so in some of these brands, we are not necessarily leveraging the support to the brand, just changing line where you will find it, as Tracey explained. I don't know if, Tracey, you want to add anything on that. Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes. No, we obviously -- with our expansion of direct to consumer, we are seeing shifts in our expense lines, so we're seeing faster growth of store operating expenses, occupancy expenses, and to Fabrizio's point, we are seeing shifts from advertising and promotion as those brands are growing slower than the brands that certainly are expanding from a direct-to-consumer standpoint. As far as your question on our expectations in the third quarter and what shifted to the fourth quarter, we had about $30 million of advertising that shifted -- advertising and promotion that shifted from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And again, that allows us to advertise both the launches that we had in the third quarter as well as the ones we are going to do in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : First of all, just following up on that advertising question. As you go into 2016 -- and I appreciate you don't want to give us any guidance, but as you go to 2016 and you put more effort behind the flagship, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder brands, do you think that the overall advertising ratio will go up? And then second question, just following up on the DDML cream. I know when you launched DDML+, it was a little bit of a disappointment in that it wasn't incremental revenue growth. It was actually just cannibalizing the core business. So what makes you think that the cream is going to be incremental to that franchise? Tracey Thomas Travis : Okay. Thanks, Wendy. I'll take the first part, and Fabrizio will take the second part. So again, we're not going to give guidance, obviously, for fiscal '16. But certainly, as we indicated, we do plan to support Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique as they continue to respond to both the new product launches and differential advertising and mixture of traditional advertising in TV, in print as well as increasing levels of digital advertising that we would expect to spend more in fiscal '16 on both of those brands. However, given the mix of shifts that we're seeing with the faster growth of other brands, that does not necessarily mean that when you look at our advertising and promotion line, you will see deleverage. Quite the opposite. I think you'll continue to see us leverage marketing, advertising and promotion with the growth that we are seeing in the makeup artist brands and some of our direct-to-consumer channels. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And Wendy, on the cream is -- first of all, Clinique has an outstanding DDML lotion business, which is loved by consumers and is preferred in many parts of the world. But for example, the cream form is very preferred in Europe. And we have seen, for example, on the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, that some years ago, developed a cream called Supreme for Europe in a cream form. This being one of the key drivers in that region of the Lauder brand, and now also Clinique will have a cream-preferred form that will have, first of all, a completely different regional relevance. In the U.S., the cream is very preferred with people with drier skin. In fact, today, in our profile of Clinique, we have an opportunity to have much higher market share for DDML in the area of people with dry skin. So there is a white space, an extra business, noncannibalizing, which is a big next [ph] extra opportunity with this initiative, in our opinion, in every country of the world. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just a question for Dennis [ph]. Can you give us a sense of how the profitability of the Online business compares with the remainder of your business? And then Fabrizio, you obviously posted strong organic sales growth this quarter. You're expecting another strong quarter in Q4. As you look out to fiscal 2016, can you discuss if you expect some of the key drivers behind that back half strength will continue? And on the other hand, in Hong Kong, can you discuss your expectations there and what you're expecting going forward? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. I will start answering this while Dennis [ph] prepare his answer on the profitability of Online and Online in general. So the current trends that are behind our strong growth, frankly, we expect to continue. And I tried to describe them in my opening statement, which is basically is the multiple engine of growth. The fact that if you look at our business by channel, by region, by brand, we have more than 1/3 of our business which is growing double digit, which basically means that the rest of our business can grow just in line with market, and we would achieve the kind of progress you are seeing today for the long term in a sustainable way. That's our model. And the way we obtain our model is focusing whatever is big and growing, more than the average and having the agility and the speed to reallocate resources wherever needed. What you see in our way of operating, I believe, is a special focus on agility and resource reallocation in a fast way to react to market dynamics. That's the strengths. So the multiple engines of growth, the differentiation of our diversification -- sorry, of our portfolios and the agility of resource reallocation depending on trends is the fundamental area compared to the advantage that we have built, and I do believe that will continue to favorably impact our business trends also in fiscal year '16 and in the future. Hong Kong that you asked, Hong Kong, frankly, we -- as I said, again, in the opening remark, we do not see the recovery that we had hoped. Hong Kong -- the Chinese travelers into Hong Kong is still weak, and the protest is creating some low level of retail particularly at the high end. So we don't see an immediate recovery of Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, we are working, first of all, to capture better to the local because that's obviously more sustainable and more for the long term. And we are, as we can get the attention again, resource allocation toward more entry price of the state [ph] versus the very high end has been typically the way the market has developed for us. And this will require some time, so I still believe Hong Kong, in the long term, will remain a very vibrant and outstanding market. But I think it will take some time to reallocate resources to the reality we are seeing in this moment. Dennis [ph]? Unknown Executive : Yes. As to the margin contribution of the online business, we don't break that out publicly. It's different, frankly, by market and by region. I will tell you that it is in the group of the highest contributors of margin to the company. So we're up in the realm of the groups that contribute the most margin to the operating margin of the company. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to understand what kind of growth rate is anticipated for the fourth quarter for brands Clinique and Est\u00e9e. And just sort of broadly longer term, what's a reasonable growth rate for those brands over the next, call it, year or 2 relative to what you've been seeing for those brands and sort of how do you holistically think about growth longer term for those brands? Fabrizio Freda : So the -- in this moment, we expect these 2 brands to be in the fiscal year on a slight decline this fiscal year, and we are working to where next year is light positive and then over time, accelerate more. But that's basically to answer your question. That's why I keep saying it will take about 12, 18 months to see a turnaround and then an acceleration. But for the moment, you need to expect the least. That's our forecast, from a slight decline to a slight positive. Then, however, we'll have a very positive input on the overall company acceleration, particularly if the rest of the business remain as solid and vibrant as it is today. Operator : Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I have a question for Dennis [ph] around decisions to work with retailers -- retailer sites. So I think before I've heard you guys talk about the decision to launch a given brand in a given brick-and-mortar retailer like you do -- Macy's on 34th Street for a given brand versus the nearby Sephora. What's the thought process for the .com business with your retailers, and I'm thinking, in particular, about expanding your presence with Ulta.com. Unknown Executive : Yes. So the first thing we do is we look in each country, in each market at fit for each particular brand. We would prefer to support authorized retailers in our brick-and-mortar relationships as each one of our -- as they're important to each one of our brands. We do look at other opportunities in each market. For instance, the Tmall opportunity in China is a unique business model. It allows us to run our own freestanding stores, if you will, shop-in-shop online. And we do look around the globe at other fits for our brands. But our preference is to start and to build our business with our authorized retailers and help them grow their online business and our brand business with them. Operator : Our next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Fabrizio, I was hoping you can address 2 things on the whole strategy with millennials given that they're always looking for new news, and it's probably making you accelerate some of your innovation or at least the pace of innovation. How do you manage this complexity, number one, but also the integrity of both Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder brands in particular as you step up the new news? Any help with that would be most appreciated. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. Tracey Thomas Travis : So let me start, Nik, and then Fabrizio will take it from there. One of the things -- and we'll start with Est\u00e9e Lauder. And certainly, many of our brands are focused and quite successful with millennials. What we have done in part of the turnaround strategy with Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique is to focus, in addition to focusing on our core consumers, also focusing on attracting this new millennial consumer, which is more digitally savvy and certainly interacts with brands initially in terms of how they consume information in a different way. Hence, the focus of those 2 brands more on digital. From a communication standpoint, some of the spokesmodel choices that we've made as it relates to Est\u00e9e Lauder to really reach out to a more digitally savvy millennial consumer in particular and some of the new product launches for Clinique that not only we believe appeal more to a millennial as well to our core consumer franchise, but also are more entry-level price point focused for the millennial consumer. We do balance that, and I'll take Clinique for instance. We started the year off with 2 very strong higher-end products for skincare, which was the Sonic device as well as Smart Serum. And certainly, that was focused on the core franchise and focused on the broader consumer base and, they're coming back with a strategy to focus on millennials. We do have a fairly regular when you talk about complexity, and certainly, we have a lot of bands now and a lot of SKUs. And we do go through a line edit every year to do a SKU reduction and SKU rationalization. And that is part -- one of the many cost-saving initiatives that we are executing against and ramping up now that we have SMI and have more visibility to that information than we've ever had in the past. Fabrizio? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And so just to say, obviously, the complexity will actually improve with all the plans that Tracey just explained, so even if we deal with more innovation and more specific targets and more local relevance -- by the way, you didn't mention but it is another driver of complexity. But the way we are operating and the concept with SMI that we will definitely be ready to manage this complexity, and the complexity will improve. Now so going back to the millennial is that I just -- it's good news. The millennials love our products. And when we talk directly to them and talk to them the way they want to be talked to, they really love our products. And the social media impacts of some, for example, of the millennial spokesmodels that now we have just impressive and amazing, and this is driving our communication with millennials. One proof of that, Dennis [ph] just spoke about our vibrant online business. This online business is driven mainly by the millennials, and this is one of the fastest-growing parts of our business. And the other thing I want to say, we do this also internally to prepare the company to be able to speak to millennial. We are making sure that Est\u00e9e Lauder company will be a great place where the millennial want to work in. And we, senior management, are working with millennials regularly, and we have programs to make sure that we listen to them more regularly to understand also, not only what they want as a consumer but also as a professional and how we can work together and modernize the thinking of the company even internally. So it's a big process. We are really embracing the need to modernize, and we are embracing the millennial generation as a generation that can help us modernizing as professionals and as consumers. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So a couple of things. One is, I just wanted to see if you have an inventory level target across SAP because it's quite great there giving all that cash back to shareholders. I wanted to see kind of how far it can go. And the number two is if you could tell us a little bit more about the relative slowness on skincare plus 4%, and how that ties to or is exclusively driven by the heritage brands especially in the U S. And what you think you can do about it especially in the context of expanding into new channels with those brands. So Ulta, more in Sephora, more SKUs, more brands, perhaps more third-party commerce sites, et cetera. Is that one of the solutions to resolve perhaps a skincare problem? Tracey Thomas Travis : Okay. So Ali, I'll take the inventory question. We are aggressively working with our organization to manage inventory turnover and to improve inventory turnover, and you're seeing the beginning results of that now. So we spoke about it last year that post-SMI, we'd have the opportunity to really leverage the tool and start to drive some of the supply chain opportunities from an organizational standpoint, everything from improved forecasting to improved flow of inventory and movement of inventory throughout our supply chain and to our consumers, so -- our customers and our consumers. So that's happening. We have talked in the past about a target of 1 40. We have not given a time frame as it relates to that. We are aggressively working towards achieving that goal and being able to commute -- or to communicate a more specific time frame for you as it relates to that goal. So you can expect an inventory update from us on the August call along with our 3-year outlook. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And on skincare, in my opinion, the best way -- first of all, skincare remains the biggest and one of the fastest growing together with makeup now categories around the world. So Ali, you are referring to skincare U.S., which definitely needs to accelerate. But skincare is driving around the world. In Asia, it continued to be, by far, the biggest category and growing. So skincare U.S. came a maximum [ph] benefit mainly from some amazing breakthrough innovation that will drive and continue push the consumer interest. And that's our main focus. And then, yes, the skincare can also benefit from -- thanks to this innovation, getting more traffic and more interest in department store about the skincare and creating more animation in store and more activity. And then the skincare continues to grow online in a very successful way, which shows, again, the potential of it when it's well targeted. And finally, you mentioned the specialty channel, which has been, for the moment, more focused on makeup and has been -- the specialty China has been one of the key drivers behind the makeup acceleration. As far as the specialty channel and the methodology of breakthrough in-store activation used by the specialty channel will translate into skincare. I think this will further accelerate prestige skincare also in the U.S. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Just a real quick question for you, Dennis [ph]. As you talk about your online business is almost $1 billion here in the next 12 months or so, can you talk about the data capture and some of the information that you're using, whether it'd be directly for the online business or just strategically across the organization, the information that you're capturing online? Unknown Executive : Yes. So it's a great question. Actually, online, as you're alluding to, we can capture so much consumer insights, and we are starting to really use those in all areas of the business, not only in our marketing for the total business in every channel, but also in product development, in R&D. And we're really getting so much feedback from our consumers, and we're using all of those data insights, which frankly differ by market and by brand around the world, but we're able to collect those globally because we have one global technology platform. And we're sharing them throughout the company to make better decisions and better strategies and better products. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded and webcast.  For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D\u2019Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D\u2019Andrea: Good morning. On today\u2019s call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you\u2019ll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges, including the re-measurement charge related to Venezuela. In addition, we will generally discuss the results before the impact of accelerated retailer orders that took place in the fourth quarter of last year due to the July 2014 implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative. We will also explain the impact of the shift in sales on our fiscal 2016 first quarter and full year comparisons. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m proud of our strong financial performance in fiscal 2015 which validated the soundness of our business strategy. We achieved very strong results which were fueled by our multiple engines abroad in all regions, despite significant currency headwinds and other unusually strong challenges and volatility. We delivered these results by having developed a more balanced and diversified business over the large years, across brands, geographies and channels. These important characteristics have become the key pillar that will help us continue to deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. This balance and diversity are important factors that have made our performance more reliable this year, even in the face of external situation that arose and were out of our control. Our fourth quarter constant currency sales growth was strong, up 7%, ahead of the industry trends due to the broad global appeal of our prestige brands, and their highly coveted beauty products. That performance capped an excellent fiscal year with constant currency sales growth of more than 6%, and earnings per share growth of 12%. We are celebrating many other achievements as well. One of our most important assets is our prestige brand portfolio, which we continue to strengthen and evolve. Our brands successfully posted fast growing markets and channels, created desirable products and attracted new consumers. Makeup is the fastest-growing category in beauty in this moment as it appears consumers are seeking for gratification of instant results. As the global leader in prestige makeup, we are capitalizing on this trend, in our brands that are focused on makeup group sales. M\u2022A\u2022C outstanding performance was driven by its constant creativity and wider distribution. Smashbox, which is strong in the specialty multi-channel generated exceptional double-digit growth, driven by a successful array of product launches. Bobbi Brown expanded its makeup lesson in counters globally, which served to highlight its unique products and philosophy and supported its growth. Many of our mid-sized small brands generated strong gains, especially those in the luxury tier. Jo Malone and Tom Ford fueled exceptional growth by adding a terrific range of products to their successful lines of existing fragrances, while La Mer and Origins showed solid growth in skin care. Within these categories, our brands innovation was a key contributor to our success. Sales for new products accounted for nearly 20% of our business. We launched products that resonated strongly with consumers across the board, including in fast-growing subcategories such as masks and white spaces areas for us like contouring. Emerging markets remain a major growth engines and had become 14% of our business. Excluding China, sales in emerging markets grew 26% with the strongest performance in Brazil, Russia and Turkey. Our China business grew 6% with every one of our 14 brands there posting gains. We now had a presence in nearly 100 cities, having added 18 new cities during the year. We continue to expand our digital presence in China, further penetrating the largest market for e-commerce in the world. Our e-commerce sales there more than doubled. And we expanded a number of brands, sites on Tmall to Ford by launching Origins and La Mer. Bobbi Brown plans to join Tmall next month. Our best performing regions was Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales growth greatly outpaced prestige beauty growth, allowing us to gain share in all markets and in most brands. Our UK business grew double digit for the second straight year. The EMEA region\u2019s success came from implementing key corporate strategies such expanding emerging markets, smaller brands and direct to consumer channels to broaden our reach among a wide array of consumers. Globally, our direct-to-consumer channels are increasing, resonating with shoppers and contributed to our strong performance. Maintaining strong momentum, e-commerce grew nearly 30% and was vibrant around the world, reflecting higher traffic and conversion. During the year, we opened 130 freestanding stores across several brands with the majority of these openings for M\u2022A\u2022C. We now operate over 1,000 freestanding stores, which provide a more complete brand immersion and their sales also rose double digits. And we have another 360 freestanding stores operated through distributors. We successfully completed the last major wave of our Strategic Modernization Initiative one year ago, which allowed us to more fully focus on realizing value from the additional capabilities. The program delivered the working capital improvements we achieved this year, particularly in inventory and payables. Looking at our bottom line, a lower tax rate and share count reduction for our stock repurchase program also helped drive our EPS performance. These were the major elements that led to our results in fiscal year 2015. We also looked toward our future growth and expanded our portfolio by acquiring four brands, a complete and certain fast-growing subcategories of beauty we identified. We have begun to nurture and integrate them into our business. I believe they have terrific potential for the long-term growth. We achieved our performance while navigating a number of micro challenges that included considerable currency fluctuations which cause the shift in travelers\u2019 buying patterns, a lingering downturn in Hong Kong that curtailed travel by high-spending Chinese visitors continue its lower economy growth in China, and a sharp drop-off in travelers to Macau. The travel retail channel was negatively impacted by these factors, as well as the MERS outbreak in Korea. There were also fewer high-spending consumer travelling particularly, Chinese, Brazilians and Russians. This global issue had a more significant impact on two of our largest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, which represents over 40% of sales. They were also affected by softness in certain department stores in the U.S. and China caused by lower spending. The balance of our portfolio collectively grew double-digits allowing us to generate excellent constant currency growth in both sales and earnings per share. We expect continuous strong growth trends in fiscal year 2016. But the growth engines will continue to evolve. We have updated our 10-year compass to position our brands in the most promising and fastest-growing areas for the near and long-term. By being agile, we will allocate our resources to where we expect the best returns on our investments. Global prestige beauty is dynamic and highly competitive. It is undergoing unprecedented changes involving how and where consumers shop, and where they learn about the kinds of products and experiences they desire. Our strategy is working precisely because we anticipated many of the opportunities stemming from this environment and invested in the fastest-growing areas to capitalize on this new shopping patterns and habits. This is an exciting time to be a major player in global prestige beauty. The industry is expected to grow again by 4% to 5%, driven by favorable demographics, a growing middle class that aspires to prestige beauty products, and a constant stream of increasing launches. As an industry leader with an unparalleled portfolio of authentic aspirational brands well suited to consumers around the world, we are uniquely positioned to capture a larger share of consumer beauty choices. We believe that emerging market consumers will continue to be one of the best growth drivers, both in local market and as they travel along key corridors. As a result, we are accelerating our expansion in key countries such as Turkey where we are building on our growth and adding seven new freestanding retail store for M\u2022A\u2022C, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Jo Malone in the first quarter alone. In China, we also plan to continue strengthening our brand portfolio as well as accelerated our makeup and fragrance businesses. We expect to enter about a dozen new cities this fiscal year, expand distribution across all our channels and lever us our organization infrastructures and capabilities. Our heritage markets are an essential contributor to our growth plans. Our UK business is expected to remain robust, fueled by continuous trends in our portfolio including gains from our largest brands, as well as the expansion of new brands in the market. We expect solid increases from department stores which have been a strong channel and we will accelerate our digital initiative and selectively increase our penetration in smaller cities with freestanding stores. We are also opening stores in high traffic location that aren\u2019t typical retail venues such as our interactive pop-up shop in the Piccadilly Circus tube station. In the U.S., we are evolving the consumer experience and service model through exciting in-store merchandising in higher traffic location. They will distort and enhance our brand messages to resonate with consumers and drive the greater conversion. We are working with our department store partners to bring more traffic in their stores to the beauty floor. When we attract consumers to our counters, we expect to convert more of them into buyers by featuring our newest products and personalized High-Touch services. Additionally, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is launching special collection of makeup and skin care developed for the North America Sephora stores, and their millennial consumers. Called the Est\u00e9e Edit by Est\u00e9e Lauder, the collection is designed for this consumer and channel and will be supported by digital marketing and social media. The Est\u00e9e Edit, along with Est\u00e9e Lauder best-selling skin care products will launch in March over 250 Sephora stores in the U.S. and Canada, and on sephora.com. Regarding our channels globally, our online sales are projected to continue growing strong double digits. We also plan to accelerate our freestanding store opening around the world both directly operated and through distributors. We expect to add more than 250 store this year, mostly in foreign markets for M A C, Jo Malone and Bobbi Brown. As we expand our retail store footprint, we are building capabilities to improve our operation and omni-channel initiative as well as our efficiency and productivity. To continue our growth in specialty multi-retailers, we are selectively expanding our distribution by adding the brands with the best fit in the retailers that are winning around the world. In the U.S., Bluemercury is expected to open more stores and location inside select Macy\u2019s. Our luxury brands are well-represented in Bluemercury, and we expect to benefit from the chain expansion. Another way we are increasing our presence in specialty-multi is by acquiring new brands that are strong in the channel such as GLAMGLOW. Newness has always been paramount in beauty, and in today\u2019s crowded beauty aisle, it is even more critical. We believe this environment favors our respected brands that place a premium on creativity and quality. Our innovation pipeline is strong, and we are emphasizing new sub-category, speed to market and products with widespread consumer appeal. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique had exciting plans underway to generate improved results this year, and that involves balancing their innovation across categories and demographics. Est\u00e9e Lauder recent launches of its New Dimension franchise of contouring products is an initiative in a white space area for the brand. The collection rolled out in North America in late July and will be followed by all other markets in September. This fall, in Est\u00e9e Lauder top-selling Double Wear foundation franchise will be introducing an innovative new compact called Double Wear Makeup To Go. And to build on its successful Modern Muse fragrance franchise, the brand is introducing Modern Muse Le Rouge. The launch will be supported by TV, digital and print campaign featuring the brand\u2019s newest model, Kendall Jenner. And we plan to leverage her substantial social media forum. Clinique has launched a new global campaign named Face Forward to introduce Clinique icon in best-selling 3-Steps product to millennials. The campaign focuses on young women influencers who are dynamic, accomplished and on the cusp of greatness. These influencers inspire young women and they can face everything in life, and with Clinique, they can face forward. Clinique has several initiatives underway to reinforce its authority in the entry price point of prestige beauty and its position in makeup, which go hand-in-hand and should help fuel its total business. Early results are encouraging. In the last two quarters of fiscal 2015, the brand\u2019s makeup sales increased. Clinique is focusing on several of its winning makeup franchises and extended them this year with new products. This includes 3-Step, Beyond Perfecting, Chubby Sticks and Clinique Pop Lip Colour and Primer. Clinique is also striving to establish its strength in skin care with key launches, including new moisturizer under the successful Smart franchise. We believe the combination of exciting makeup and skin care launches compelling market and target to millennial consumers and focused distribution expansion will work to turn around this large important brand. M\u2022A\u2022C again expects to post double-digit growth by sticking to what the brand is and what it does best, a fashion trendsetter that creates fun, unexpected and edgy collaborations and products with a highly talented group of makeup artists in its stores and counters. Our mid-size brands had a strong trajectory ahead. We have an enviable track record of developing small brands into sizable ones. In the last five years, Jo Malone had tripled in size and La Mer sales more than doubled, becoming our fourth largest brands. These success stories inspired our recent acquisition and the potential we see in them. In our four newest brands, we are connecting the creativity with our extensive industry knowledge as we develop new products, expand distribution and strengthen their digital platforms and communications. Digital marketing and social media clearly continue to grow in importance. Across our brands globally, we are devoting capability building resources to strengthen our talent in the digital space, creating our ability to further grow via new technology that enhance our storytelling and maximize consumer engagement. Our brands are also leveraging key influencers online and developing real-time content to create ongoing communication with consumers. The implementation of our SAP platform is enabling greater visibility into various aspect of our business, such as indirect procurement, advertising and promotion and corporate services. This allows us to analyze our expenses to determine efficiencies and effectiveness and take actions where appropriate. Benefits derived from this area built into our profitability forecast, while continuing to allow for a portion of the savings to be reinvested in additional growth capabilities. This should give you a good sense of the many plans we have underway to maintain our momentum in fiscal year 2016. We are well positioned in a vibrant industry that continues to expand even in volatile times. We remain confident about our ability to deliver strong and reliable results. Thanks to our well-diversified business and successful strategy. We expect to continue to outpace global prestige beauty growth by at least 1% point annually due to the far-reaching consumer appeal of our brands around the world, and the exceptional quality of our products. Thanks to our multiple engines of strong growth in numerous countries and channels, coupled with the excellent momentum in many of our brands, our goal this year is to again deliver superior sales growth, double-digit EPS gains and greater stockholder value. Our company made tremendous strides in fiscal 2015. Most importantly, we demonstrated by being both well diversified and agile, we can quickly alter our game plan when needed to react to changing market conditions and still achieve our goals. For this, all our employees deserve credit, and I thank them for their dedication and hard work. Together, we have produced another year of excellent results and look forward to a bright future ahead. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and full year financial results, and then share with you our expectations for fiscal 2016. Please note that my commentary excludes the year-over-year impact of restructuring and other charges primarily the Venezuela re-measurement charges. Also excluded is the impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that otherwise would have occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to our July 2014 rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift was $178 million in sales and $127 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.21 per share. This shift created difficult comparisons for the first quarter, the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2015, and will also create comparability issues for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2016. Now, for the fourth quarter, net sales came in at $2.52 billion, which was 7% growth in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed 50 basis points of this sales growth. Net earnings were $153 million compared with $175.2 million in the prior-year quarter reflecting increased door openings, investments in information technology and in R&D and product development. Diluted EPS of $0.40 came in above the top end of our expectations primarily due to continued disciplined expense management. Reflected in the EPS for the quarter was approximately $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions, and currency translation was unfavorable by $0.07. Looking at our business by region for the quarter, net sales in the Americas increased 12% in constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in Latin America which came primarily from the continued great growth of M\u2022A\u2022C in Brazil and also in Mexico. We also had a high single digit increase in North America, which reflected good sales growth in both the U.S. and Canada, and was led by the online and specialty multi channels as well as improved sales to department stores. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, net sales increased 3% in constant currency. Many markets in the region benefited from increased tourism, largely due to the weaker euro. We achieved double-digit sales gains in the UK, the Balkans, Benelux and many emerging markets including Turkey, Russia, and South Africa. The larger markets of France, Germany and Italy collectively grew low single digits, while we saw softer results in Spain. Our sales in the travel retail channel declined 4% despite strong retail sales, primarily reflecting the impact of the MERS outbreak on inbound travel to Korea, continued weakness in travel to Hong Kong and Macau, and the related customer destocking and currency-driven softness in other travel retail locations such as Hawaii and Brazil. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 4% in constant currency, led by double-digit gains in China, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. Japan contributed solid growth as we anniversary the impact of the VAT increase last year and benefited from higher tourism due to the weaker yen, while Korea grew low-single digits. Hong Kong remained weak, reflecting the decline in tourism and Taiwan sales declined on weak \u2013 a continued weak retail trends. Net sales by product category rose double digits in most categories for the quarter. Skin care was the exception with sales declining 2% in constant currency. Increases from La Mer and Origins and incremental sales from GLAMGLOW reflected in part the continued growing popularity of sub categories like masks. However, these gains were more than offset by the declines in skin care at Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique across serums and moisturizers. Sales in the makeup category rose 10% in constant currency, led by the continued strength of M\u2022A\u2022C, Smashbox and Bobbi Brown. The expansion and growth of Tom Ford Beauty also contributed to the category. Both Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique posted modest growth in makeup in the quarter as they benefited from some recent new product launches and marketing activities in the category. Sales of fragrance products jumped 26% in constant currency. Continued strength in high-end fragrances from Jo Malone and Tom Ford combined with incremental sales from our recent acquisitions were the main drivers. The category benefited also from initial shipments of the new Michael Kors Gold Collection which launched in July. In hair care, sales rose 10% in constant currency. Aveda launched thickening tonic and new products in its Be Curly line. The brand increased distribution across channels in the UK and Asia and delivered strong salon sales in Western Europe. Bumble and bumble is also seeing continued strength in the specialty-multi and online channel. Our gross margin increased 30 basis points to 80.7% primarily related to favorable currency in some channel mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 110 basis points to 71.6%. The primary driver was higher selling and store operations cost of 100 basis points to largely to new store openings in the quarter related to our retail store expansion strategy. As a result, operating income declined 9% to $228.3 million, and operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 9.1%. Turning to the full year, as Fabrizio indicated, we delivered strong full year results while navigating a number of challenges most notably the significant strengthening of the dollar, and its multiple impacts on both translation and consumer travel. Net sales rose 2% to $11 billion. Excluding the effects of currency translations, sales grew more than 6% even without the acquisitions, which contributed 30 basis points. Net earnings grew 2% to $1.18 billion, and diluted EPS increased 3% to $3.05, which includes $0.05 of dilution from the acquisitions. Unfavorable currency translation impacted EPS by $0.24. In constant currency, diluted EPS rose 12% for the year. Once again, our sales growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. Gross margin increased 20 basis points to 80.5%. The increase came primarily from favorable pricing, currency and channel mix, partially offset by the higher cost of some new product introductions. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 40 basis points to 64.6%. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher retail store operations cost reflecting the increase in the number of company-operated freestanding retail stores, acquisition costs, as well as investments in information technology. These increases were partially offset by approximately $100 million from our cost savings initiatives and leverage in our overall marketing and advertising cost, reflecting the rapid growth of brands with less traditional marketing spend as well as the shift of media investment from traditional to digital. Operating income rose slightly to $1.74 billion and operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our operating margin was unfavorably impacted by 30 basis points from acquisitions and 40 basis points from unfavorable currency. Excluding these factors, our operating margin would have expanded by 50 basis points. Net interest expense improved 10% to $45.7 million, primarily due to higher interest and investment income this year. Our effective tax rate for the year was 30.3%, a 60 basis point improvement from fiscal 2014, driven primarily by a reduction in the effective tax rate related to our foreign operations. All major elements of working capital improved in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. This was largely driven by the continued progress in our supply chain service initiatives which helped improve inventory days to sell by eight days at 190 days to sell at year-end. The decreased days were also driven by favorable currency translation, which was partially offset by higher inventory to meet demand for our sales objectives for the fall season and increase in the number of freestanding retail stores and the addition of new inventory from our acquisitions. For the fiscal year, on a reported basis, we generated approximately $1.9 billion of cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 27% or $408 million versus the prior-year period. We invested $473 million in capital projects, principally in counters, new retail stores and information technology. We used $241 million for acquisitions and given that the bulk of our remaining cash was overseas. In June, we took advantage of the favorable rate environment, and issued $300 million of 30-year senior notes at 4.375%. We returned more than 90% of our reported free cash flow to stockholders during fiscal 2015 through dividends and share repurchase activity. We repurchased approximately 12.4 million shares of stock for $983 million, reduced our diluted shares outstanding by more than 7 million shares from the prior year period, we also used $350 million to pay dividends to stockholders, which reflected a 20% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, and a payout ratio of nearly 30%. The combination of our increasing dividend and strong stock performance this fiscal year delivered total stockholder return of 18.1%, significantly higher than the average of our peer group, and more than double the 7.4% return of the S&P 500 over the same period. Looking ahead, our strategic view of opportunities remains unchanged even as we evolve our tactics based on the learnings of the past year. Our goal remains to exceed global prestige beauty sales growth by at least one percentage point annually, and we expect to achieve that goal with top line growth of 6% to 8% annually in constant currency. As Fabrizio said, we achieved above-industry results through the strength of our brand portfolio, investing behind the fastest consumer growth areas and distinctive new innovation. Geographically, we continue to expect rapid expansion in emerging markets, reflecting the increasing disposable income of a growing middle class. In developed markets, we plan to optimize our brand portfolio and selectively increase penetration in smaller cities. Looking at our distribution channels, we continue to see great momentum in E&M commerce, travel retail, freestanding retail stores, and the specialty multi-retailers. We expect omni-channel initiatives to evolve the way consumers experience brands across all channels and drive higher sales as a result. And importantly, our superb brand portfolio allows us to deploy the right brands with the right products for each channel, geography or demographic opportunity we see. We are working to stabilize and grow our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands, continue the rapid growth of our makeup and luxury brands, and expand our newest brands. We remain open to further acquisition opportunities and continue to target an average of 1% point of sales growth from acquisitions over the three-year time horizon. Flexibility, agility and the strength of our execution are crucial for our company to compete in a rapidly evolving dynamic industry. This means that in any year as we have done, we must be able to allocate resources to tools and capabilities to evolving and dynamic geographic, brand, product or channel opportunities. At the same time, our goal is to produce double-digit EPS growth in constant currency each year. Sales growth is an important driver of our long-term growth and value creation, and it is expected to account for more than half of our expected EPS growth over the next three years. We will continue to annually progress margin expansion and combined with share repurchase and effective tax rate reduction, we will deliver our EPS goals. When we set our three-year margin goal last year, the currency assumptions were much different than they are today. As I mentioned earlier, adverse currency movements curtailed our fiscal 2015 operating margin by 40 basis points and will also have an impact in fiscal 2016. Additionally, the four new brands we acquired are expected to be slightly dilutive for the next few years. Over the next three years, we will further leverage our investments in SMI to accelerate cost savings while investing in capabilities needed to increase our competitiveness. We see three major areas contributing to operating margin expansion. About one-quarter of the improvements are expected in gross margin from a combination of pricing, channel mix, and SMI-enabled cost of goods reductions. About two-thirds of the improvement are expected to come from our SMI-enabled cost savings initiatives including indirect procurement, A&P effectiveness, and other programs targeted to improve the efficiency of our operations, and the remainder is expected to come from productivity. These benefits will be partially offset by investment to turn around our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands, further expand and support our retail stores, further develop our digital and omni-channel tools, and build capabilities and talent across all of these areas. With these factors taken into account, we now expect further cumulative operating margin expansion of approximately 90 basis points to 130 basis points in constant currency through fiscal 2018. The annual improvement may vary by year based on both the momentum of the business and the opportunity for investment to drive profitable growth. Working capital improvement is another goal enabled by SMI. Today, we have greater visibility into our inventory globally and the SMI program, along with other tools, assists us in improving turnover through better forecasting and demand planning, which should also help to reduce out of stocks. At the same time, we are often getting the fastest growth from countries that are more distant from our production facilities and therefore require longer lead times for transit. Still, we have already begun to see the net benefits begin to accrue from our SMI efforts, and we are targeting inventory days to sell improvement to approximately 155 days by the end of fiscal 2018. While inventory is the largest area of opportunity, we expect improved performance across all of our working capital drivers. If we achieve our goals over the three-year time horizon, we expect to free up approximately $300 million to $400 million in additional cash from our accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory level, which will greatly accelerate our growth and cash flow from operations. Now, let me discuss our outlook for the fiscal 2016 full year and first quarter. The sales shift related to last year\u2019s SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year in both the first quarter and full fiscal year. I\u2019ll discuss our expectations, adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rates both before and after the shift impact are available in today\u2019s earnings release for your reference. For the full year, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. All regions are expected to contribute to that growth, led by EMEA; and all product categories are forecasted to grow, led by fragrance and makeup. Pricing is expected to contribute between 1.5% and 2%, continued distribution expansion for most of our brands is expected to contribute between 2% and 3% of growth. Last year\u2019s acquisitions will add an incremental 50 basis points, and the remainder is from sales growth and existing distribution as well as new innovation. Currency translation is estimated to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 3% to 4%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of $1.07 for the euro, $1.51 for the pound and $1.26 for the yen. We are leveraging SMI to create value for the organization through greater efficiencies and cost savings. We have a strong governance process in place to support our value creation team efforts and ensure continuous cost improvements. In fiscal 2016, we will generate expense leverage through our value creation initiatives which are expected to garner over $200 million in savings primarily from indirect procurement, A&P optimization and cost of goods efficiencies. And we continue to look at opportunities that will produce progressive cost savings. To support and sustain our long-term growth, we will reinvest a portion of the savings behind the turnaround of our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands, further expansion of retail stores, R&D and innovation, information technology and talent. We will continue to be nimble with our resource allocation which impacts the quarterly cadence of our spending. For fiscal 2016, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 29% to 30%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.10 and $3.17 including $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. Compared to our fiscal 2015 EPS of $3.05, before charges and the accelerated orders, EPS is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. The projected three percentage to four percentage points of adverse currency translation on sales in fiscal 2016 equates to about $0.18 of EPS. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. In fiscal 2016, on a reported basis, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of sales, which will primarily support consumer-facing investments in counters, retail stores, and online site development as well as systems, facilities and manufacturing. We will review our capital structure annually \u2013 we review our capital structure annually with the board, and we do not expect any major changes in our philosophy for this fiscal year. We prefer to maintain strong credit ratings, which gives us flexibility to access cash at favorable rates. We have distributed an average of 100% of annual free cash flow to our stockholders over the last four years through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio, and as of June 30, we had approximately 28 million shares remaining on our buyback authorization. Looking at our first quarter, we expect sales to rise approximately 6% to 7% in constant currency. Translation can hinder growth by approximately six percentage points to seven percentage points. We will support a strong start to the new fiscal year by making choiceful investments in our first quarter to achieve this. We expect incremental investment behind new product launches, notably Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s New Dimension, store expansion, and our new brands. We also will make further investments in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique turnarounds and in information technology. The initial impact of the MERS outbreak in Korea during last fiscal year\u2019s fourth quarter is continuing into our first quarter and pressuring our profitable travel retail business. Also weighing on profits this quarter is continued weakness in some other areas including Hong Kong and Macau, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation [ph] vesting and acquisition-related expenses. At this time, we anticipate that EPS will be between $0.66 and $0.69. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.09 of EPS. In closing, let me reiterate that we are pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2015 and with the opportunities we just shared with you and with the business that is increasingly more balanced and reliable than ever, we intend to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth. So that concludes our prepared remarks and at this time, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So on the long-term margin targets, clearly FX and acquisitions are pressure points, but I was hoping you could comment a bit on your ability to generate some incremental productivity internally to at least bridge some of that gap from these external issues. And given your efficiency in margin gap versus peers, why there's not more of a sense of urgency in attacking the productivity to deal with some of those external issues. Thanks. Tracey Travis : So, when you look at the margin guidance, the cumulative margin guidance that we gave over the next couple of years, if you take into consideration both the foreign exchange impact from last year as well as what we called out for this year in terms of impact and the initial dilution from our acquisitions, which should mitigate in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe, but 2015 and 2016 we\u2019re seeing dilution. We are actually relatively close to where we had guided to at the end of last year on that 17.5%. So, we do think that given both the currency impact that we\u2019ve had and the acquisitions that we chose to do, we are in line with our prior guidance. Since that guidance, a few other things have happened. Clearly, the strength or the strong foreign exchange impact has impacted some of our channels like travel retail. The MERS impact is having us start off this year with a bit of a softer impact and we feel it\u2019s very important for us to invest in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. So the balance that we have, which is why we\u2019ve actually increased our cost savings plans in order to do some of the funding that we need to support those programs and that\u2019s important for us in terms of long-term growth. Fabrizio Freda : I would like also to add one thing to this question, to this answer is that as you\u2019ve mentioned sense of urgency, there is an enormous sense of urgency in the company to continue to grow margin and we are fully committed to it. The \u2013 already in the 17.5% that we communicated at that time, there was a lot of cost savings included. Second, we have increased them, and as Tracey has explained, we will continue to look into that and maybe find even more opportunities but there is commitment to that. The point is, however, that also investment needs and investment opportunity also had been increasing. And our decision is to make sure that we keep focused on the long-term growth and sustainable growth of the company. And so we are leveraging cost savings but also continue focusing on the investment needs and opportunities to keep the company growing the best possible way. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tracey, a question for you. When we were sitting at this point last year and you had guided to 2015, I think you had guided to 5% and 6% top line growth constant currency and EPS growth of 7% to 10%. If we compare that to your growth going forward for 2016, 6% to 8% top line and 8% to 10% bottom line, can you just help us characterize the differences in that top line guidance and the relative flow-through to EPS looking ahead versus hindsight looking to the prior year? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Yeah. I mean, the growth levers that we have in fiscal 2016 are much like they were in fiscal 2015. So, one of the things that we saw in fiscal 2015 that we just spoke about was the tremendous strength of the makeup category. So, we certainly expect continued strong growth out of all of our makeup brands. One of the other things that we saw was more softness in skin care. And that certainly affected Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and we are expecting better performance in skin care in fiscal 2016 than we saw in fiscal 2015 and therefore better performance for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. In terms of the flow-through to profit, with all of the mix impact that we have from channel mix and category mix, we don\u2019t expect a tremendous amount of gross profit margin expansion, but some. So, that \u2013 the leverage that we will get will be in the expense area. And as I indicated, certainly over the next three years, we expect a one-third split between margin expansion and gross profit margin and two-thirds coming from expense leverage. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys, I just wanted one clarification and a real question. The clarification remains around the cost cutting plan, which even if you take out the currencies and take out the impact from acquisition, it just doesn't seem like SAP is allowing you to accelerate much at all whether it be from margin or whether it be from inventory. So if you just take another shot at helping us out on that that would be helpful.  The other question is to try to get a better understanding on the channel diversity strategy which has certainly helped and I guess I have questions around three areas. One is the travel retail impact from the Chinese luxury tax change. Two is how we should think about your ROIC and margin given the ramp-up significantly now to 1,000 of freestanding stores? And then three is how have you guys analyzed the brand risk of Est\u00e9e Lauder into Sephora? Thanks for all those. Tracey Travis : Well, that\u2019s a multi-part question. So, let me start with the SMI savings. Ali, we believe this year based on what we\u2019ve communicated, we had very good results from SMI. As you know, we went live in July of this year. It does take some time for the team to get familiar with really optimizing SMI and our biggest markets went live in July. So, the fact that we were able to generate $100 million of cost savings and we are doubling that next year, we believe is very good progress. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that there is more savings out there to gain over the next few years. So, our internal plan call for increasing levels of savings every year related to SMI-enabled programs. As it relates to working capital, going from what was 200 days to sell to 155 days to sell is in the timeframe that we\u2019re indicating is pretty great progress. And so, we certainly, as we always do, will try to exceed those levels of improvement. But being able to free up $300 million to $400 million of cash over this timeframe is obviously very good for us, very good for our shareholders, and allows us the opportunity to either invest in more ROIC-driven projects or return more to shareholders. So, that\u2019s a good thing. So, I think we believe that we\u2019ve got a very strong program and we certainly, to Fabrizio\u2019s point, are committed to continuing to look for even greater savings. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. And in answer to your other 3-in-1 questions is on, TR we believe there is enough price differential in the TR channel to continue growing the part of TR business which is driven by price differentials. I want also to underline that a lot of the TR business is driven by conversion and marketing and error reports and other activities, particularly true for makeup where the absolute price differential is much inferior to fragrances, skin care and is growing actually in this moment faster than skin care. So the impact on TR of the tax difference in China we believe would be moderate and anyway there are other growth drivers in TR, which have the potential to more than offset that.  The second is the freestanding store \u2013 the impact of freestanding store expansion on margin and ROIC, we believe [ph] you should look at the total business, meaning that some of our freestanding stores are very, very productive, particularly the one on market Jo Malone for the time being. In this case, the impact actually is positive. But also you need to think that the overall margin of online is higher, travel retail is higher. Some of the more productive freestanding store is higher; part of the specialty multi around the world is higher. So the combination of all these factors makes actually the channel mix favorable rather than unfavorable if we continue to drive our strategy the way we are. The last question on Est\u00e9e Lauder in Sephora, we believe this is an important step forward for the brand. I personally don't believe there is a risk, actually this is very good news for the ability to modernize, rejuvenate the brand in front of the millennial consumer. That is a specific goal of this action. Sephora in the U.S. has an excellent penetration on millennial consumers and the ability of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand to tailor its activity to this consumer will have also a positive halo effect on the entire brand nationally in our opinion. So all good, we are pretty excited about this move. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit about the staying power of the impact of brand strength because it looks like your outlook implies that you're expecting local currency sales growth to accelerate as the year progresses, even though the benefit from acquisition lapse and the pace of investment spend also decelerates, clearly have a much bigger delta and investment spend at the beginning of the year and less so as the year progresses. So can you talk about the staying power of the impact of brand spend and if your expectations have changed relative to what you've seen in the past and if so what are the key drivers behind that? Tracey Travis : So, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is quite a shift in terms of how we spend relative to brands. So, we\u2019ve talked a lot, Olivia, about the fact that the brands that are growing right now are the non-traditional advertised brands. They\u2019re the brands that have an in-store presence. They have a strong digital presence. And then from a category standpoint, as we said, makeup but also fragrance is growing in this moment.  What we are seeing even in our more traditional advertising brands is the impact of TV moderating, still important but moderating, and the impact of digital growing. So, we have looked at balancing our investment spend across television, print, digital and in-store for those particular brands. There are also different channels that are growing. So we, too, have looked at balancing the channel mix for our brands. So, I think the strength of brands is still quite strong. We\u2019re seeing, given the online strength of digital marketing, a lot of smaller brands gaining in strength because of the channel, that channel of communication with consumers gaining in strength. Fabrizio Freda : And on the staying power question, I'd like to add that this fourth quarter we've been growing 7% which is faster than the industry, faster than most of our competitors. And this has happened despite some important challenges for us. We spoke to it but I want to underline that Hong Kong and Macau or Korea are very important areas for us, areas where we have high market shares, where we have profitable businesses, where particularly our skin care brand and skin care category is enormously focused and then we were able to deliver ahead of market 7% strong growth despite these headwinds on top of the currency one. And then this shows actually, in my opinion, staying power and stability of our growth model even in the presence of unexpected challenges which are out of our control, like MERS as an example in the month of June which had a big impact and also in the beginning of July. So there is a lot of staying power and to Tracey's point, the rebalancing of the media spending actually is in my opinion going to increase the staying power rather than diminishing it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. The first is, have you considered maybe just pulling the margin targets entirely? Because it seems like there's so many growth initiatives. And I think for investors top line growth and EPS growth is probably more important than a margin ratio, especially given the magnitude of some of the money you could spend to build out stores in some of the other channels, et cetera.  And then my second question is on Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder has the world changed? Because it seems like every five years or six years the brands go through a big growth challenge as you spend a lot of money, you get them fixed again and they start to struggle thereafter. So is that 40% of sales for those two brands like a number you want to stick to? Because as they slow, it seems like the natural margin mix of the business improves pretty dramatically and I do not know the answer but it seems like just given what's happening in the prestige cosmetics world broadly speaking everything is lifting up and to the right and it's hard to take those two brands there. I'm sorry for the long-winded question. Tracey Travis : So let me take the first part of that, Bill. As it relates to the margin guidance, the reason we\u2019ve transitioned to cumulative margin guidance is for the very reasons that you mentioned. The fact that in any given year, if we have the opportunity to invest in more freestanding stores or invest behind our acquisitions that are going to actually continue to drive above-industry sales growth and above-industry EPS growth, then that is the right strategy and decision for us, and it\u2019s the right strategy and decision for investors. So, having said that, to transition from giving annual margin guidance to EPS guidance is a bit of a transition. So, we\u2019re happy to be transparent with respect to what we\u2019re thinking and the fact that we absolutely understand we have margin opportunity and we are progressing forward on that with our cost savings initiatives and other initiatives. Yet at the same time, there are some investments we\u2019re making that are going to be more margin challenging and others that will be quite margin accretive. We may have a year where we have an 80-basis-point margin expansion and we may have one that we have 20 basis points. But what we are saying is we will have double-digit EPS growth, so your comment is well taken. Fabrizio Freda : And also on this one, I want to add that in this volatile world which is in front of us it is where agility is a key driver of success. We wanted also to ensure we had multiple drivers for our ultimate goal of double-digit EPS growth. And so the multiple driver is certainly growth is important, margin will continue to be important, but we have other taxes, we have the share repurchase and share count. So we have different drivers that can deliver more constantly even in a volatile world. So we are stronger and we believe our point of view is becoming actually stronger and more reliable every year. On your question on Lauder and Clinique, Lauder and Clinique are very important brands for us and they are excellent brands with a great equity around the world. We can share the equity results of these brands, there are brands that huge appreciation and penetration among many different consumers around the world. So, those are important assets of the company and we want to continue to build on these assets. However, they are very big brands and so they have big brands with broad distribution and a very broad distribution. So, I believe the most important thing for these brands that they are more exposed to the new volatilities of the world than the smaller brands which have limited distribution and very specific consumer groups that like them. For example, in this moment, what we have seen in the last year meaning the crisis in Hong Kong, the crisis in Macau, now the flu in Korea and the slowdown of the growth of China, all these factors had a tremendous impact on Lauder and Clinique. And particularly on the skin care business on Lauder and Clinique which is very visible. And frankly these factors which are external have a bigger impact than what one innovation can do in the course of six months. So, these brands are \u2013 have been more difficult to turn around than the small brands because they are so broad in distribution and so big. But anyway we remain determined to drive them and to leverage the great assets that their equity represents for the company. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : Hi, there. Good morning. I'm just wondering on pricing given the devaluation we have seen some companies take more pricing, you're sticking to the 1.5% to 2% as a global number and I'm wondering if you see any upside to that. And then how many stores \u2013 standalone stores could you envision on a four-year to five-year basis if [indiscernible] company operated to date that would be very helpful. Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay. So, in terms of pricing, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, Caroline, we have and you know we have a pretty sophisticated pricing process. In any given year, we look at all of our markets. We look at our traveling corridors and we adjust pricing either up, mostly up. But in some cases, we actually adjust it down if \u2013 for currency reasons, et cetera. So, this past fiscal year, we actually did take pricing up in some markets like Venezuela, Russia and other markets as well. And we did adjust some prices down as we indicated also.  So, the 1.5% to 2% represents a combination of price adjustments both up and down, most up obviously given the net for the fiscal year. But we absolutely do look at currency competition and many other market factors when we establish pricing for all of our markets. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. And on freestanding stores, we will continue to drive freestanding store on some of our brands. Not all of our brands are designed to have a winning and successful freestanding store model as part of the total model. But in general, we are continuing to expand. And particularly, we are continuing to expand where there is not sufficient high-quality distribution in specialty or department store or other models. And the important thing is that the other [ph] evolution will be on the channel, meaning the ability to connect the stores with the online. And so, wherever there is not good alternative distribution freestanding store well-connected to online are proving to be an enormous opportunity to make the brand successful even in absence of high-end prestige distribution available. A typical example of this has been Brazil where without the freestanding store and the online business of M A C, M A C today could not be the market leader there in absence of the typical counter distribution that in Brazil is not available. So, freestanding store, we continue to increase, again, we are not in a condition to give you a specific number but it continues to increase and will make our ability to reach the new consumer of the world much stronger than it was in the past. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers : Thanks. I just want to go back to the margin guidance and just make sure I have my facts straight. So you used to be at 17.5% for fiscal 2017 and now it sounds like off an adjusted fiscal 2015 base of what I think is 15.9%... Tracey Travis : Right. Steve Powers :  \u2026 it sounds like you're guiding to basically 17.2% at the high-end one year later. So annually, you've gone from a 50-basis-point run rate to 30 basis points to 40 basis points. So, I guess just going back to the earlier discussions, how much of that gap is really just the differing FX environments versus something more structural? It sounds like you're investing more in advertising, in new channels. It sounds like brands like Clinique and Est\u00e9e are not quite where you want them to be. So, I'm just trying to figure out the gap there. That's my just clarifying question.  And then, Tracey, the working capital improvements that you target, how much of those will accrue to the U.S. versus overseas markets? Because I just want to gauge how much of that cash will be accessible without tax implications versus just building on the balance sheet? Thanks. Tracey Travis : Okay. So as it relates to the margin, you are correct that the starting point is 15.9%, and as we spoke in our prepared remarks, currency between 2015 and 2016 accounts for about 70 basis points. Acquisitions accounts for about 30 basis points. So that kind of bridges some of the difference between what \u2013 where we were at previously and where we\u2019re at today. It\u2019s primarily currency and the acquisitions, which were not foreseen when we obviously gave the three-year guidance previously at 17.5%. And so that\u2019s that explanation. As it relates to working capital and where cash is generated, we called out and as you\u2019ve seen from our results, we\u2019ve got strong growth overseas which we expect that that will continue. Our working capital improvements will be across the board. So, some of them certainly will be in the U.S. We have our largest manufacturing operation here in the U.S. and some of them will be overseas as well. So, it will be a combination of both. I can\u2019t give you a precise split at this point in time. You certainly have seen that our tax rate has come down this year and is expected to come down next year also. And so I think the combination of all of the strategies that we have in place will be quite favorable from a company standpoint and from a shareholder standpoint. Operator : Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Tracey Travis : Good morning. Lauren Lieberman : I just want to \u2013 good morning. I just wanted to understand a bit again about year because I've heard and I think in the press release it was a little confusing, Fabrizio in his quote and on the call has talked about a goal of double-digit local currency earnings growth and then for fiscal 2016 on that basis you're looking to do 8% to 10%. So is the reason it's not solidly double digit, is it the softness in Asia and that it disproportionately impacts Clinique and Lauder\u2019s skin care which is higher margin? Or is it that there is also a stepped-up reinvestment this year with the goal of accelerating growth in some way? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. First of all, I'd like to say the 10% is at the top of the range and in that sense when we put something at the top of our range means that we will do our best efforts to reach it. And, however, the reason why this is not in the middle of the range this is exactly the reasons you just underlined, meaning that there is both high profit pressure in certain externally just like Hong Kong, Macau, the situation in Korea, the slowdown in China and all these factors and the fact that these external pressure happen to impact particularly the skin care part of our business and which is highly profitable and very concentrated on Lauder and Clinique. So it is exactly the combination of these factors that we don't control what will happen out there. And so we want to be prudent in that sense and we needed to be able also to invest the appropriate amount of money to navigate this situation in fiscal year 2016. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan : Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. A question on Clinique Est\u00e9e, so what was the sales performance in 2015 and if not specific just broad strokes? And then what are the expectations for the brand in 2016 and maybe if you could just talk about that progression a little longer term?  And then differently just switching to emerging markets, so 14% of sales today maybe talk a bit about where you can be over the next three years to five years on a percentage of business basis, again, just broader strokes. How do you benchmark your exposure versus peers and then what is the cost on the operating margin outlook to achieve that continued expansion and specifically sort of what categories lead the growth in that channel? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So, in fiscal 2015, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique were down low-single digits in constant currency. And so, we expect them to be up in fiscal 2016 low-single digits. So, that\u2019s the difference between fiscal 2015 and 2016. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. The second question was about emerging markets, so emerging markets today are 14% and we will continue to grow them in the next years. I prefer not to give you a specific number but you need to just \u2013 you can make up your numbers when you say that we are growing 6% to 8% every year in emerging markets ex-China are in this moment growing 20% plus. And China is projected to grow between 6% and 10% depending year-by-year. Those are the numbers which are emerging. So, it will be a growing percentage of our total business. Now, what we need to invest in there as we explained China today is already more or less in line with the average of the company. And some of these emerging markets are ahead of the balance of the company. Others are in the beginning of the investment period. So overall, the investment is relatively reasonable to grow in emerging markets gradually the way we are doing it. So, this is not going to be a huge part of pressure on margin. It's rather the investment in other areas which are an important pressure on margin. Operator : Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Just a couple of housekeeping things. Number one, can you give us the like door growth for your sales in China, not the retail takeaway but your sales into China. Number two, Tracey, you called out lowering the tax rate as a long-term driver of earnings growth but just looking at the progress that's already been made over the last decade, you're already below 30%. What's the five-year target for the tax rate, if you will, and I know it's subject to various geographic things and whatnot?  But then my last question and sort of broader question is on the travel retail business because this is, whatever, it's been a tough 2015 for travel retail. Each of the quarters you've talked about it being either down in reported terms or low single-digit growth. And I have to go back to 2009 when obviously the macro was wildly worse than it is right now. So, I'm just wondering how many \u2013 you've been attributing the weakness in your travel retail to currency issues and less traffic and a little bit of MERS and a little bit of that but it just feels like the growth in the travel retail business may have structurally changed. So, I'm wondering is it that there are fewer airports that are opening, is there more competition in that channel because your growth of strong double digits in that channel seems to have evaporated? Thanks. Tracey Travis : Okay. Let me start, Wendy, with your question on the tax rate. As we guided this year and you\u2019re right the tax rate has come down over the last few years. We guided 29% to 30% at this point. I think the low end of that guidance would be what we are prepared and again, to your point, with lots of contributing factors to think about for the longer term at the 29%. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. And let me start on the travel retail question and then I will cover China. First of all, just to put the number straight, our travel retail business grows 6% at retail this year, which is a very solid growth which is slightly ahead of the traffic, so is a very strong number. So, I'm not sure I agree that there's been an overall [ph] travel. It's true that it's not been double digit like it used to be in the past and the reason for that is that this was a very tough situation where you get Hong Kong, Macau travel and then you get the Korean MERS activity in June and July and other factors like the important change of certain emerging market consumers that are very heavy spenders like Russian, Brazilians and in lower part Chinese. And all these driven by currencies as well on top of by economic crisis in some of these countries like Brazil or Russia. The combination of these factors all happening at the same time including the flu in Korea, yes, have been putting pressure on travel retail. And also keep in mind that we have made the historical choice that paid out very well to focus particularly on the Asian travel retail expansion that was the driver of skin care around the world. And this part where we have historically created a very big market share has been the one hit the most in the current external situation. We believe this is going to change. Every year there will be a different situation and we continue to believe that travel retail in the long-term will be a very strong driver of the business. And I don't think at all that our strength has evaporated. Actually, I think we've never been stronger in travel retail than today in terms of balance of brands, balance of airports and ability to grow in the future. Second, I just want to underline, for example, in the quarter \u2013 in the last quarter, we had travel retail net sales were minus 4%, travel retail \u2013 retail that we have only until May by the way, was plus 9%. So we have been growing 9% retail. Now, June where we don't have the retail number probably was a different number impacted by the MERS in Korea, still very solid retail trend in travel retail even in the last quarter. China, our net sales in constant currency in China was 6% in the year. Our retail in China was 8% growth during the year and the like door in China was minus 1% for the year. Tracey Travis : Which was improved from the prior year\u2019s like door growth. Fabrizio Freda : Which was an improvement, yes, because last year, fiscal year 2014 the like door was minus 2%, so there was a little improvement. Operator : Your next question is from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just would like a clarification with regards to the Americas growth, the 12% adjusted. So if you can break it down by North America, how much was acquisitions, how much was retail sales? And then I was surprised to see that you flagged Venezuela as a contributor because there have been [ph] scarcity to \u2013 for currency for necessities and I don't think that your categories qualify for that. That's a clarification. My question is whether you are experiencing margin degradation in department stores in the U.S. and whether you expect with the launches in Sephora that that margin degradation is going to worsen? If that happens, is it possible that you would shut down the less profitable doors in department stores in the U.S.? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay, Javier. Let me start with the Americas growth and the components of that growth. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, Latin America which is certainly small relative to North America but it did grow strong double-digits and that was driven by Brazil and Mexico largely, but also Venezuela. Obviously, there\u2019s the inflationary environment in Venezuela, so that is one of the markets where we did take pricing and that has nothing to do with cash repatriation or anything like that. As it relates to the U.S. and Canada, we had high-single digit, mid- to high-single-digit growth. So, again, a strong quarter for the overall Americas and those were the components. On the acquisitions, this year, again, they were acquired at different points during the year, mostly in the latter part of the year. So, we had about roughly $30 million in sales from the acquisitions this year. So, a relatively small amount, most of that in the Americas, some of it though overseas as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and some of the other brands also have sales overseas. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. On the margin in department store, now, we are having a big stable margin situation in department stores in the U.S. And as far as the Est\u00e9e Lauder expansion in Sephora, we believe this will benefit the overall equity of Est\u00e9e Lauder and in turn this will benefit the growth in every single channel. We don't believe this will be a negative for department stores at all. Operator : Your next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning, everyone. You talked a lot about millennials and different strategies to capture millennials. Where do you see the greatest opportunities? And will the level of product innovation, should we continue to see more newness catering to millennials? And lastly, on the advertising budget, how are you thinking about advertising dollars shifting to digital from traditional in the context of the entire budget? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Well, I will answer the first questions. So the focus on millennial is a very important focus. Obviously, we have brands in our portfolio which are already very strong on millennials like M A C and are market leaders in many of these areas with many of the makeup categories with millennials in North America and around the world. Kors, Smashbox or many others or some of the new acquired brands like GLAMGLOW. So, in our portfolio, we have brands which are even more focused on millennials and we have an innovation plan for them for each one of these brands. The two brands that we are trying to accelerate in terms of penetration with millennials are Lauder and Clinique. Clinique is historically very strong with millennial at the entry price of prestige. And as you heard in our prepared remarks, Clinique is doing a lot of new effort to revamp this ability to attract and engage millennials, particularly in the area of social media and specific product launches at the entry price point of prestige and particularly at the entry price point of makeup where the brand has opportunity with millennials. As far as Lauder is concerned, you heard that there are several activities that we are doing, for example, with new models like Kendall Jenner, which have a lot of attractiveness with millennials. And this is happening even on fragrances with Modern Rouge launch. And then there is obviously the newly announced Sephora launch, which is actually designed an entire collection on makeup and skin care designed for the millennial on top of the social media that will go along with these activities. So, we are very focused on millennial in the next years. And we are seeing initial very encouraging results. And we have a strong starting point from some of our brands like M A C. Tracey Travis : And then the second part of your question in terms of the growth between digital and traditional advertising, I\u2019ll just point out that more of our brands, again, we have a broad portfolio of brands. And more of our brands do digital marketing than traditional marketing. So, our digital spend is already higher than traditional marketing because of that. But having said that, if you were to think about it in terms of mix shift, about 30 basis points are shifting into digital out of traditional marketing. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : Thanks. Guys, I guess for Americas, I know not all of this is necessarily operational but I guess, number one, can you talk a little bit more about the profit decline in the Americas, that 78% number was kind of big on an adjusted basis? And then skin down to on an adjusted basis, look, I understand the Est\u00e9e and Clinique serums and moisturizers are down but just curious if there was anything unusual in the quarter on skin or is this the way to think about a run rate in any way? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : I\u2019ll start from the skin. As I explained, Asia is \u2013 70% of the market in Asia is about skin care and our market share in skin care in Asia is very, very high. The moment the external factors happens mainly concentrated in this area like Hong Kong, Macau, the flu in Korea, this has an over proportional impact on skin care and specifically on serum and moisturizers, as Tracey explained in our prepared remarks. So, that's the unusual thing of the quarter that happened on skin care and that's the key factor in the short-term. And then there is a longer-term factor which is the fact that to grow skin care, we need to activate a stronger growth on Lauder and Clinique as we have been talking across this call and we have solid plans for that for the long-term.  Now, I\u2019ll turn to Tracey for the other parts. Tracey Travis : So, in terms of the decline in the Americas profitability, as you indicated, there are more than just the region performance in the Americas profitability. These numbers, first of all, in our press release, are not adjusted for constant currency, so they are adjusted though for the re-measurement for Venezuela and for the SMI shift. So, they\u2019re not \u2013 the decline is not from an adjusted standpoint \u2013 a constant currency adjusted standpoint not as great as what\u2019s reflected in the press release. But the acquisitions and the purchase accounting related to those acquisitions flows through the Americas. Some of our enterprise IT expenditures flows through the Americas and then the stock comp that we called out flows through the Americas as well. So, on an ongoing basis, no, we would not expect that the Americas profitability would be down. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of quick ones. First, on travel retail this is, I guess, the third consecutive quarter where you've seen a pretty wide divergence between sell-in and sell-through. And I know there is a lot of destocking that has to go on but how much more is there before we see those two numbers start to converge at hopefully a higher number from here? And then secondly, on China, I think, you mentioned it was up 6% last year overall sales for you guys and I think, Fabrizio, you said 6% to 10% is probably a good run rate number. Is that what we should expect for fiscal 2016 given what's gone on with the change in tariffs and the devaluation of the yuan, for example? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : So, I will start from China. Yes, that 6% to 8% to 10% is the range we aim at. And I don't know if you should expect it because there is a lot of unknown in front of us in China in this moment. But that's definitely what we are trying to achieve in our plans, tailored to achieve the 6% to 10% range. And so on travel retail is the point is that there is still \u2013 when there are issues like a flu epidemic in a place [ph] like Korea which is one of the biggest markets, you have to expect that the retailers that don't know when this will finish will readjust their stock levels in a very decisive and immediate way. And so some of this stock just travel retail is an area where stock adjustment when they happen, happen fast and when they are driven by external factors they can be unexpected and very, very strong. So I would \u2013 to answer your question, I would like to separate the unexpected situation like we had the one in Korea from the ongoing. I believe that in terms of the ongoing travel retail model for the future, we should see a convergence of net and retail and that should become more or less aligned. But obviously this excludes specific unique factors like the epidemic of MERS in Korea that could further impact the difference between sell-in and sell-out. For example, this may happen again in months like July where the MERS continued. End of Q& A Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our first quarter and full-year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior-year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal 2016 year is off to a good start. In the first quarter, we delivered excellent financial results, generating strong adjusted constant currency sales growth of 8% and earnings per share growth of 16%. Our winning strategy and business model are at the core of our success. Our strength came from our broad portfolio of prestige beauty brands which is diversified by category, geography, and channel with multiple growth engines across all these areas. We can accelerate the ones working well and reallocate resources as market dynamics change. These factors continue to make us more resilient and position us for long-term, sustainable results. We are pleased to operate in the global prestige beauty industry which is growing fast even during volatile times. Within the industry, makeup is today the fastest-growing category, and we are a global leader in prestige makeup. Once again, our luxury and makeup brands were the best performers, fueled by the intrinsic brand equity, strong launches, and solid base of business. Worth noting are Jo Malone London, Tom Ford and La Mer in the luxury tier. M\u2022A\u2022C and Smashbox were standouts in makeup, a category where consumers are increasingly spending more of their beauty dollars. We are especially pleased with our results in light of the softer retail climate in China and Hong Kong, the MERS impact in Korea, a sharp decline of Russian and Brazilian travelers, and significant and higher than anticipated currency headwinds. From a geographic standpoint, we delivered a stellar performance in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Growth in the region was helped by an influx of travelers attracted by the weak euro. Our midsized brands, notably Tom Ford and Smashbox, had the fastest growth, benefiting from strong retail trends, well-received launches, and new doors. Our growth at retail was robust, and we gained share in prestige beauty in several established markets, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy. We also had double-digit growth at retail in nearly all EMEA emerging markets. The online and specialty multi-channels were vibrant in the regions. Sales in Boots and Douglas were particularly strong. Freestanding store are a key component of our expansion in the region and we added 9 new location for M\u2022A\u2022C and three for Bobbi Brown during the quarter. We continue to expand and improve our business in travel retail. Our sales at retail rose 7% with most of our brands and markets growing despite currency headwinds affecting travel from a number of key consumer group including Japanese, Russians and Brazilians. In line with our strategy to introduce more brands and expand our reach in the channel, we launched Darphin and GLAMGLOW and opened nearly 100 new counters for our other brands. The forecast for international passenger traffic growth is healthy 7% for the fiscal 2016 which we believe will help improve our business in the coming months. However, our net sales declined in travel retail due in part to a tough comparison with the previous year first quarter. We also experienced a weaker business and significantly lower trade stock in Korea as a result of MERS concerns. Total air travel visitor to Korea dropped about 40% from June to August and continued to be weak in September even though there were no new cases reported. We expect travel to Korea to improve as fears of MERS subside. In North America, all of our brands grew sales. Makeup continue to be the strongest contributor to growth, up high single digits. Specialty multi remains one of the fastest growing channels, rising double digits for the quarter. Four of our brands opened new doors in Bluemercury and we had strong sales growth in Sephora. We plan to further broaden our presence in specialty multi. Clinique continues to selectively expand in Ulta and Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is on track to launch its new Est\u00e9e Edit collection of makeup and skin care products in March in approximately 250 Sephora stores and online. In Asia Pacific, Australia and Japan were strong and Korea had another positive quarter. In Australia, a weaker currency drove greater local consumption. Distribution is expanding for prestige beauty and online is growing strongly. Our sales were solid across all channels, and we gained shares in department stores. Our sales in Japan rose high-single digit in the quarter, as the lower yen stimulated greater tourist activity especially from Chinese. Local demand for prestige beauty was solid. Our business in Korea continues to improve and strengthen. Our net sales grew mid-single digit and our sales growth at retail exceeded prestige beauty growth. As our brand successfully competed with local brands and leveraged the new Korean trends. Korea is a trendsetting beauty market that is known for both rapid innovation and high quality products. One element of our strategy is to build our presence in the local market to participate in the popularity of Korean brands. Last week, we announced we are making an investment in the in the novelty Korea Skin Care Company behind the brands Dr. Jart+ and Do The Right Thing. This a strategic opportunity for us to partner with high growth, distinctive brands that combine Korea innovation with a global sensibility. The investment give us, our company an opportunity to support Dr. Jart+ development and continue success around the world. We look forward to working with the company's entrepreneurial founder as he continues to grow the brands. For us, this investment creates another pillar in our long-term growth strategy for Asia. In China, most of our brands had higher sales, many rising double digits, fueled in part by the increasing demand for makeup. We are accelerating expansion of our makeup brands to leverage this market trend. M\u2022A\u2022C grew 25% at retail in the quarter, and this year, it's planning to open more doors in more cities. Tom Ford opened its first department store counter in China, with the expectation to add several more during the fiscal year. These gains came amid a backdrop and soft retail environment in China caused by many factors, including the stock market volatility there. The company retail results in China were overall flat, with lower traffic in brick-and-mortar stores offset by higher volume online, where our sales nearly doubled. Our net sales declined 3% due to lower sales of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, which had a tough comparison with the previous year when its major new introduction occurred on July 1, and this year, New Dimension launched in mid-September. However, the brand remains the largest prestige beauty brand in China in its distribution. Although we are seeing Chinese consumer spending less at home, they are travelling more and purchasing abroad, particularly in Japan and large European cities. For example, La Mer and Jo Malone benefited from the huge rise in Chinese tourists in Paris, which helped drive sales growth of more than 50% for these brands in France. While China's economic expansion is moderating, it remains healthy, and we are bullish on our long-term prospects. We expect to grow high-single digit this year, in line with the industry. Hong Kong continues to be affected by sharp declines in Chinese travelers and weak local consumption. We are the largest prestige beauty company in Hong Kong, and Est\u00e9e Lauder is the largest brand. But our sales at both net and retail declined in the quarter. Despite this climate, several of our brands grew, including M\u2022A\u2022C, Tom Ford, Jo Malone. We are pushing opportunity to strengthen our business with local consumers in Hong Kong. However, we do not anticipate a significant pick up in consumption in the near-term. Another major growth engine is our e-commerce business. Online sales rose 26%, with excellent growth from brand, retailers and third party sites, with particular strength in EMEA and APAC. Mobile sales were vibrant, and now account for more than one-third of our global online sales, and more than 50% of online sales in the UK. Overall, orders increased and conversion rose strongly. We continue to expand our online availability and opened 100 new digital brand locations globally, mainly in international markets, on both our sites and retailer sites. For example, in China, Tmall continues to be a strong contributor to our online sales, and Bobbi Brown launched on the platform in September, bringing the number of brands we sell on Tmall to five. We also progressed on our strategy initiatives. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are both launching new products across categories, and making good progress on their turnaround plans. Est\u00e9e Lauder grew in several regions and gained shares in EMEA. During the quarter, the brand introduced New Dimension, reinforcing its leadership in serums. It launched in the U.S. and the UK in July, and in the rest of its international markets starting mid-September. The line is performing to expectation, and is proving to be a terrific recruitment tool in Asia. In makeup, the brand's new Pure Color Envy Liquid Lip Potion has done really well globally. Clinique #FaceForward campaign has strengthened the brand's attraction to younger consumers and generated extensive editorial coverage. The campaign has helped improve sales of its 3-Step franchise in North America, the UK and Asia/Pacific. Clinique also launched a digital editorial lifestyle platform called The Wink, highlighting emerging trends, global influencers, wellness articles, travel, and beauty information, essentially the people and the ideas that inspire the world of Clinique. This platform is intended to help Clinique strengthen its relationship with current consumers and recruit new ones. Our recent and upcoming launch activity is strong across all categories and brands, and we have an excellent selection of gifts for the holiday season. Let me give you a few examples. In skin care, La Mer introduced the Renewal Oil, the first oil formula for the brand, and Genaissance serum essence, which builds on La Mer Miracle Broth technology at the uber (13:55) luxury price point. Clinique launched Sculptwear serum and Smart moisturizers, and Origins New Original Skin Rose Clay Mask strengthened its leadership in prestige masks. Several brands have developed new foundations. A high loyalty product, Smashbox BB Water, a makeup with a very high-light texture, is off to a great start. M\u2022A\u2022C is launching Studio Waterweight SPF 30, a gel-serum formula, and also Matchmaster cushion compact, the first of its kind for the brand. Building on the success of Beyond Perfecting Foundation and Concealer, Clinique recently expanded their franchise with a powder foundation. We have a full slate of exciting new fragrances in time for the holidays, including the Michael Kors Gold Collection, Tory Burch Absolu, Donna Karan Liquid Cashmere White and Black, and Jo Malone Mimosa & Cardamom. Est\u00e9e Lauder leveraged the excitement of its Modern Muse Le Rouge launch by live-streaming the event on two popular social media platforms, Snapchat and Periscope. We are pleased with our strong start this quarter. We remain committed to deliver strong constant currency full-year sales growth ahead of the industry and double-digit EPS growth, even though, as I explained, we expect continuous lower growth in some key markets and channels around the world. Our performance this quarter demonstrate our many strengths, and is proof that, by staying focused on our long-term strategy, we can successfully navigate external challenges and market volatility to deliver sustainable and reliable results. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2016 first quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. And to clarify our underlying business performance, my commentary on comparisons to the prior year excludes the first quarter and full-year impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that shifted sales from the first quarter of fiscal 2015 into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift was $178 million in sale and $127 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.21 per share. Also excluded for the full year is the impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales were $2.83 billion for the first quarter, which was 8% growth in constant currency. Last year's acquisitions contributed 70 basis points of this sales growth. From a geographic standpoint, Europe, the Middle East and Africa had a standout quarter. Net sales in the region rose 11% in constant currency, with double-digit performance occurring in both Western developed markets as well as emerging markets. Strong local demand for our products, as well as increased tourism in Western Europe, fueled double-digit increases in major markets such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We also continue to achieve strong double-digit sales gains in many emerging markets, including the Middle East, Russia and Turkey. Our net sales in the travel retail channel declined 7% as we experienced inventory adjustments among retailers in Hong Kong, China and Korea, as well as anniversaried strong shipments prior to the retail slowdown that occurred in October of 2015. Sales at retail in the quarter were strong 7% as Fabrizio mentioned. Net sales in the Americas increased 9% in constant currency. Strong double-digit growth continued in Latin America led by Brazil and Mexico. North American sales grew mid-single digits which reflected double-digit growth in Canada and solid growth in the United States. Sales were strongest in the specialty multi, online and department store channels while tourist-driven doors have been meaningfully negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Net sales in the Asia Pacific region were flat in constant currency. Australia delivered another quarter of double-digit sales gain, a sharp increase in Chinese tourists combined with good local demand, drove stronger growth in Japan, and Korea generated mid-single-digit growth. This sales growth was offset by the less favorable trends in greater China, most notably in Hong Kong. Net sales by product category were led by the 16% constant currency growth in makeup for the quarter. The biggest contribution came from the continued strength of M\u2022A\u2022C. And makeup sales of Tom Ford and Smashbox rose double digits on brand expansion, new products and strong same-store growth. Est\u00e9e Lauder again had growth in makeup including strong demand for its Double Wear franchise. Sales of fragrance products rose 12% in constant currency. Luxury fragrances continued to drive sales growth led by double-digit gains from Jo Malone and Tom Ford and incremental sales from Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle. The launch of the Michael Kors Gold fragrance collection also contributed to sales. Hair care sales rose 6% in constant currency with growth from both Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda launched pure, dry shampoo and benefited from other recent launches. The brand also delivered strong salon sales in Western Europe. Bumble and bumble continued to generate good growth in specialty-multi and online channel. Skin care sales declined 1% in constant currency reflecting the current global industry trend favoring makeup. La Mer, Origins and Darphin generated solid growth, and the category benefited from the incremental sales from GLAMGLOW. These increases were more than offset by Asia-driven declines at Est\u00e9e Lauder, which are a large part of the brands business there. And U.S. department store weakness at Clinique. Our gross margin of 79.6% was flat with the prior-year quarter. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 90 basis points to 63.6%. The primary drivers reflect our strategic priorities. We incurred higher store operations cost from the increase in freestanding retail store openings over the past year. The strategic acquisitions we made in fiscal 2015 added 30 basis points to operating expenses as a percent of sale. Our investment and innovation and product development continues to rise at a faster rate than sales. And these increases were partially offset by reductions from our cost savings initiative. As a result, operating income declined 5% to $453.2 million, and operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16%. Also affecting our operating margin were lower sales from our high-margin travel retail business. However, our adjusted constant currency operating income increased 8% in the quarter and resulted in flat constant currency operating margin. Net earnings were $309.3 million or 14% above the prior-year quarter in constant currency, primarily reflecting the higher sales and a 350 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate. Diluted EPS of $0.82 came in above the top-end of our expectations due to higher than expected sales, continued expense management and a lower tax rate. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.11 of unfavorable currency translation and approximately $0.01 of dilution from acquisitions. Continued progress in our supply chain initiatives and favorable currency translation helped improve inventory days to sell by 13 days to 180 by the end of September. These improvements were partially offset by the inventory build necessary to meet our future sales growth objectives and the additional inventory from our new brands. During the quarter, we generated $8 million in cash flow from operating activities, which reflected normal, seasonal, higher-working capital requirement and inventory to support the holiday selling period. The comparison of our cash flows versus prior-year was also unfavorably impacted by the cash received from the accelerated orders in the prior year. We invested $90 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support new retail stores and counters. We utilized $387 million in cash to repurchase approximately $4.7 million shares of our stock, nearly double the amount purchased during last year's first quarter. We also paid $90 million in dividends to stockholders. Additionally, this morning, we announced another 25% increase in our dividend rate. Let me now turn to our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal year. For the full year, the sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year. I'll discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rate both before and after the shift impact are available in today's earnings release for your reference. For the full year, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency has become an even greater headwind than previously anticipated. And we now estimate the translation could negatively impact our full-year sales growth by approximately 4% to 5%. Our estimate assumes current spot exchange rates of around $1.10 for the euro, $1.53 for the pound, and $1.21 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. However, we are still expecting our diluted EPS to be in the range between $3.10 and $3.17 including $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. The increased currency headwinds are projected to affect EPS by about $0.24, $0.06 more than we projected when we last gave guidance. Our strong first quarter performance gave us comfort to raise our expected EPS growth to 10% to 12% in constant currency. Regarding the second quarter, our sales are expected to rise 6% to 7% in constant currency. The translation impact of the stronger dollar could contract growth by approximately 5 percentage points to 6 percentage points. Activities behind our key product launches and our holiday programs should help drive sales growth. As we have said before, we manage our business on a full-year basis and for the longer term. And our spending by quarter can vary, depending on the needs of the business and how the quarter progresses. At this time, our second quarter diluted EPS is anticipated to come in between $1.04 and $1.08 per share, including approximately $0.10 per share of adverse currency translation. As you are aware, the company has been engaged in a multi-year upgrading and modernization of its systems and processes. In a continuation of these efforts, we are transforming our global technology infrastructure to improve the delivery of internal IT services throughout the organization. We are transitioning from a platform of company-owned assets to one that is primarily vendor-owned. We will be utilizing a new third-party provider with an enhanced scalable platform to improve our ability to respond to the demands of the business and leverage more advanced technology. We expect to record restructuring and other charges of approximately $40 million to $50 million, primarily to write off certain IT assets. Implementation of this initiative will take place throughout calendar year 2016. We expect the transformation to increase operational efficiency, reduce future IT service and infrastructure costs, and result in additional future savings, freeing up cash that we may reinvest in capabilities and growth opportunities. This initiative will also be return-generating. We are pleased with our start to the year as we deliver strong sales and earnings growth and progressed well on many of our growth and efficiency initiatives. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little about the gross margin. And as you look out over the next couple of years, as you look at your business mix moving to more of a sort of company-owned store environment, how should we think about the gross margin? Because if you look at this quarter, obviously great top line growth, but not quite as much leverage there as I think some of us had hoped for. So can you give us a little bit of an outlook in terms of maybe is mix having a bigger impact than what we've currently been modeling? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. We have different gross margins, depending on the different channels of business. So as it relates to our growth in retail, as we grow our retail business or our online business, for that matter, we would expect that gross margin \u2013 that's a benefit to our gross margin from an overall average company standpoint. There are other channels and brands that have lower gross margins. So as we've spoken in previous quarter calls, depending on the mix of our business in any given quarter, you would \u2013 you will see a range of gross profit margin performance and operating margin performance, which is why we continue to focus on the full year in terms of the guidance that we give and you should expect. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Just actually two quick questions. Fabrizio, I was wondering if you can give me or give us some thoughts on market share for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, just kind of going around some of your largest region especially in China. And the second question just so I can understand this whole IT initiative, should we be expecting any disruption related to inventory like we saw with SMI or is this completely unrelated? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I'll answer the second question first. Regarding this shift in terms of our IT infrastructure, it is not like the application that we implemented with the SAP initiative. So, the SMI initiatives though, we will not expect to have an inventory build similar to what you've seen, thankfully, for SMI over the last few years. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And in term of market share, as you can imagine, we are growing global market share, with net retail sales in the 8% range, and with the market growing at this point, from our estimate, around 4%, we are really growing strongly global market share. However, in some areas, in Lauder and Clinique particularly, the market share could be flat or declining. For example, you ask about Asia. In Asia, Lauder is the clear market leader in Hong Kong. And in China, with the softness of these two markets, obviously, the overall market share in Asia of the brand is under pressure. And Clinique, which is the overwhelming market leader in U.S. mid-tier department store, with the lower growth in this channel versus the other channels in the U.S., also Clinique market share overall in that area will be under pressure. But overall, globally, we are doing a very good progress in market share, again with the same strategy of a good portfolio by category, and then by channel and by country. Operator : Your next question is from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Thank you. At one point, the Chinese traveler and locals, I think you believed were about 10% of your business. And with the shifts you've seen, Europe, it sounds like, is attracting more Chinese tourists, but Hong Kong isn't. And I wonder if you could just tell us what you think happened to growth of sales to the Chinese consumer overall? Was it up or down, or what are your thoughts there? Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Our estimate is, our sales to Chinese is up, and it continues to be very, very strong and very solid overall around the world, but as we explained, where this growth happens is changing. And then, depending of the market share of our brands in the specific area where the Chinese are going, then there could be a bigger or lower impact. So the fact that there is an issue in Hong Kong in this moment, obviously that's a negative for our sales to Chinese, because we are, as a company, the market leader in Hong Kong. But overall, as you said, we are getting great benefits in Europe and we see good progress in other markets where \u2013 like Japan, where the Chinese in this moment are going and buying a lot. Finally, you see an impact on the U.S., mainly in the U.S., because of the strong dollar. The amount of purchases to Chinese consumers has decreased in the last quarters. And obviously, we have a very high market share in the U.S. and we have been penalized by that trend. But all in all, again, we look at the long term, we believe Chinese consumers in mainland and around the world are, and will continue to be, a great source of growth, and a great source of business, and we remain completely focused on them, independently from the mix impacts in the short term. And we have been able to deliver a great growth in the quarter despite, in the quarter, a relatively negative mix impact of the Chinese spending. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Guys, I guess I wanted to ask about EMEA, right. And I understand that you had an influx of, I guess, Chinese shoppers in there. I think you cited that as helping. But if you strip out the travel retail decline, it looks like EMEA, ex that travel retail decline, was up very substantially, right, maybe mid-teens, maybe high-teens? I guess \u2013 let me know if that's wrong. And if it's not, how sustainable is that in the near term? And do you get a bounce in Asia before you get what could be a slowdown in EMEA from those giant growth rates? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We believe this is a strong trend. We are doing very well in EMEA, and growing market share in many, many of these markets. And we believe we have plans to continue this trend. UK is really booming. In the UK market, the market is growing 7% in prestige, more than mass. We are doing great job in attracting consumer for mass, and in growing market share across all channels. The emerging markets in EMEA, which are a big part of this, we are growing outstandingly. Just to \u2013 our total emerging market growth this quarter was 13%, excluding China was 31%. So, in the EMEA market, we are growing basically one-third of our business on top of what we had, and this is supposed to continue, and we have very clear plan on that. So, EMEA in total, excluding TR, by the way, is 23% growth. And so, really standing, and there are several reason why these strengths \u2013 I'm not sure as the same identical strengths of the quarter, but this good solid trend is expected to continue. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And the only thing I'll add to that is, embedded within our guidance for the balance of the year; this was, to Fabrizio's point, a very, very strong quarter for EMEA, and we do expect that to continue, certainly benefiting from both the tourist as well as strong execution of our brand programs in the region. A bit moderating for the balance of the year, relative to what we experienced in the first quarter, largely benefiting, particularly from some of the shifts in the quarter that happened fairly quickly with the MERS situation, as well as the situation that we referred to in China, and people changing their travel plans, in addition to the benefiting from the lower currency in Europe. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. Actually, two questions, if I may. First, a simple one. Travel retail net sales have fallen short of what you've reported retail sales to be by double-digits for two consecutive quarters. So, given that, do you think we're going to see normalization and reversion of net sales, matching retail sales on a go-forward, and do you think this can sort of abate some of that, that margin headwind? And secondly, Fabrizio, during your prepared remarks, you made numerous mentions to sort of distribution build : new counters, new doors, new stores. Any sense of how much that, in aggregate, is contributing to your growth? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll start with the second question. Contribution to our growth is or distribution is 2%. So, 2 points of growth are distribution increases we met in the quarter, which is a continuing verse of what happened the last fiscal year. In terms of travel retail, what you should expect, first of all, the traffic increase of \u2013 in travel retail today is about 7%, and so remains very solid. But the mix of it, meaning there are less Brazilians, less Russians and Chinese are going in different places than Hong Kong, this mix has a negative impact in the short term on conversion, meaning on the number of travelers, that really buy, buy in a big way because different populations have different conversion rates. So, again, in this global, complex world, you need to keep in mind mix has a huge impact. So we believe that in the future, the mix impact should improve because, as you know, there is in the base the turmoil of Hong Kong that started in October, November. MERS should get out of the base as well, and meaning that the MERS impact should not be there anymore in the future. And then we, specifically as Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, as we are doing in every other aspect of the business, we are modifying our portfolio and adjusting and diversifying also our travel retail sales, meaning we are building stronger business in EMEA, stronger business in the Americas. We are diversifying our brands. We are launching new brands. We are covering more airports, more tier-2 airports. So we are continuing our strategy of diversification also in travel retail, and we expect this will benefit our trend, it will make us less dependent on short-term mix inputs in the travel retail evolution. Operator : Your next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. So obviously, some of your Paris based trends had some pretty negative commentary overall particularly in travel retail. So can you just give us an update in terms of inter-quarter trends, if you saw any change through the quarter or through October so far? And then just update us on your assumption on industry growth for this year. Is it still 4% to 5%? Thanks so much. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I mean, on travel retail, the quarter was tough obviously. And so, I think we agree with the negative comment on the quarter. Our point of view on the long term future of travel retail remain however very positive and we believe travel retail is and will remain a strong channel, a channel of growth and a great opportunity for us. And then, we believe that in the continuation of this fiscal year in the next 12 months, we should see gradually an improvement of the trend as I was explaining because many negative impacts on the travel retail will be in the base \u2013 in the base (40:25). And so, that's the difference. And... Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The market? Yes. We do still expect the market growth to be 4% to 5% this year. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. My question has to do with the change \u2013 not call it the change, the emphasis on opening stores that you announced in August. If you can tell us how many stores have been opened this fiscal year, 2016, and what will be your corporate like-for-like growth, excluding M&A and new store openings? So that will be my question. And a clarification with regards to EMEA, it seems that I understood that \u2013 or at least this is what I gather \u2013 that ex- travel retail, all the other pieces in aggregate of EMEA could do 23%. So how much of that is a \u2013 you mentioned that emerging markets grew 31%, so the Western European piece grew very rapidly as well. Could you tell us what you're doing with Boots and Douglas? It seems that you had mentioned that on the passing. Are you opening more doors? If there is more opportunity to increase distribution in Boots and Douglas? Thank you very much. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : All right. So, Javier, let me go ahead and start. In terms of new door openings, for freestanding stores, now we referenced both freestanding store and freestanding format openings, as well as some of the openings that we're experiencing in travel retail. But as it relates to retail, freestanding stores and freestanding store formats, we expect to open about 250 this year. As it relates to in our growth algorithm of 6% to 8%, how much we're expecting to come from distribution, it's about 2% to 3% of the 6% to 8%. And as it relates to the acquisitions this year, we're expecting about 50 basis points of our growth in that 6% to 8% to come from the new acquisitions that we did last year. Operator : Your next question is from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Our question relates to your initiative, particularly around the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, to broaden the reach to the millennial customer. And maybe you could talk a little bit about your digital content initiative with respect to the brand portfolio more broadly. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you for your comment. And, yeah, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, as we explained, is doing several trends to complete the turnaround, go back to long-term growth levels. One of these steps is focusing more on the millennials and attract new consumers and particularly younger consumers to the brand. The key activity recently has been with the new model Kendall and all the activities behind Kendall Jenner launch of the new fragrance or new makeup. And the daily social media activities behind these new launches, they've been very successful. And so, we will try to continue that. And as part to this plan to attract more millennials, behind Kendall, behind the social media, behind specific product launches, we attribute particularly high importance to the launch in Sephora U.S. of Est\u00e9e Edit with 250 doors next March. Then we'll be continuing this progress in attracting to the (44:13) brand the millennial generation. Operator : Your next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. So, Fabrizio or Tracey, given the challenging macros out there, I'm surprised you're willing to raise your FX-neutral EPS guidance so early in the year here after the Q1 beat. So, I was just hoping to get a sense of what was really driving that. Your FX-neutral sales range remains the same, but maybe you're more comfortable where you're landing within that. Or is it more due to the margin side and maybe the cost of doing business is not as high as you expected? And just to your level of conviction that you can deliver that earnings growth with the global volatility out there will be helpful. Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, I will start on and I'll let Fabrizio pick up on the environment and our expectation as it relates to sales. But I think in terms of our comfort level with raising our guidance, one of the things that we are saying is better leverage on some of the initiatives that we were expecting for this year. We've talked a lot about our flexibility and agility as it relates to expenses. And the ability that we have created over the last few years to shift resources to fund the initiatives that are driving more momentum. This certainly starting this quarter there was a tremendous amount of uncertainly, we bet on some strong winners this quarter. Hence, we're able to deliver the quarter and we think we have better insight into what will work for the balance of the year relative to the initiatives that we started the year with. So, that gives us comfort in terms of our ability to deleverage our initiatives a bit better than what we had initially anticipated. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And then overall, I think you posed the question that say, is it really overall, is the amount of confidence and the amount of things that progressed well in the quarter, like our cost savings, our activity internally and also to the mix because we were anticipating a softer Hong Kong or softer China and we have planned to offset, I said, to reallocate the resources in EMEA and in other areas and to accelerate the United States and North America in general. Obviously, the softer part was more sure than the good part and the good part was validated with the activity we've done in the quarter. And so, the reassurance that we saw in the fact that our strong offsetting investment we are working well gave us more confidence to get the balance of the fiscal year in the direction we just stated. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning, everybody. I just wanted to clarify. So, is your expectation still that Clinique and Est\u00e9e brands get back to growth this year? And then, sort of more broadly on the same brand, I guess, investors \u2013 it seems to us at least, lump those two brands together. But I'm curious internally how you view longer-term growth prospects for each brand? And obviously, they're different brands, different positioning. And in terms of the Clinique brand, it seems a little harder, to sort of get a sense of how it fits in with a consumer that wants either lower end or higher end with the entry-level Prestige brand perhaps becoming more squeezed from a consumer purchase standpoint longer-term. I'm just curious how you think about that and could there ever be a scenario where you look to dispose of that brand in favor of investing in other things? Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, let me answer (48:14) question. There is no scenario in which we dispose of any of these two brands. Those are two core brands of the company, it will continue to be our priority. And, yes, our goal is to bring these brands back to single-digit growth as soon as possible. Now, the brands are very different, you stated one from another. So, the brands are making progress as I stated in my prepared remarks, both brands, but let me take them one-by-one. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is making progress in makeup. We already turned around the makeup part, and we will continue to accelerate that. We have a strong holiday plan on fragrances with Modern Muse Le Rouge plan, and we expect to continue making progress on the fragrances. On the skin care part of the Lauder brand, frankly, with Lauder being the market leader in Asia where over 90% of the business is skin care, and in this moment, a global softness happening and being so focused on Hong Kong and China skin care business. It's very difficult to have the skin care turnaround executed and finalized in the short period of time in that external condition. Said this, we will continue working on it, we'll continue to diversify, and we expect also \u2013 we have the goal also to turn around the skin care part as soon as possible and as soon as market \u2013 external market condition also will be a bit more favorable for the skin care product. On Clinique, same thing. Good progress on makeup, which is a very important part of the Clinique business, and good progress in many markets around the world. For example, Clinique in China has been, in the quarter, growing double digit and is one of our fastest-growing brand there. The Clinique challenge has been in departments \u2013 the mid-tier department store U.S., in the area of skin care particularly, and that's the area that we are attacking with the next set of initiatives and activity, working with our partners to turn around also this part. I also want to say, in the U.S., Clinique continues to grow, for example, very well in specialty multi, in Sephora, in Ulta and in overall online. So good progress, and yes, we are still determined to bring both of these brands with their very different problematics and strengths to single-digit growth as soon as possible, external markets permitting. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Could you guys talk about a few things? First, shipments versus consumption in the quarter \u2013 and I know it is not a great resource, but it looks like NPD continues to pretty dramatically trail some of the numbers you're reporting. So I would love any commentary you have there? And then, the price harmonization impact in China \u2013 so I know it is fairly early, but I'm just trying to figure out, are the Chinese shoppers \u2013 is it price-driven, or is it experience-driven, when they buy overseas? Are you seeing them by only in travel retail; outlets, because it is cheaper because of the duties; or are they buying it more exponentially, and I think probably the latter is better than the former? And then, just lastly, very quickly, have you ever thought about like a more of an omni-channel approach to Clinique, including maybe going into masks? I know you have done very well in Boots in the UK. I think you have a decent business at Shoppers Drug. So I wonder if you ever explore like CVS or Walgreens with Clinique. I am out of breath. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Wow. So, again, let me start from the last part, no. We have no intention to bring Clinique in any other distribution than prestige global distribution. So there will not be expansion of Clinique to mass. Clinique is a prestige, luxury brand that need service element attached to the business model to be successful around the world. This will remain the same. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Bill, as it relates to NPD information and shipments versus sell-through, I assume you're referring to the U.S., the North America NPD numbers. And a couple of things that I would point out; in our first quarter, September is a pretty heavy shipping month for holiday sales, so that would affect shipments, and you wouldn't necessarily see that in the retail sell-throughs and the market share information. And also, free standing stores are not in that information... Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And online. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...and online, so \u2013 or not our online site. So those are two elements that are missing that are certainly in our numbers when we report, that you don't see in the NPD numbers. Operator : Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I actually wanted to talk a little bit about holiday, just kind of in general, your outlook in terms of the broader retail environment. I know sometimes when there's heavy promotion around other areas of retail, it can impact category growth in beauty. So a little bit on that. Anything you are doing differently in terms of gift sets, or positioning around holiday would be great. And then, secondly, within the U.S., just curious on Est\u00e9e. Because you've had New Dimension in the market for the better part of the quarter, how skin care for Est\u00e9e performed in the U.S., and just any kind of color on the outlook for New Dimension's momentum forward. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, so on holiday, we feel confident we have a good set of activities, particularly strong on our fragrance business, on our makeup business, and we believe we are well prepared. There will be also our portfolio brands, and the growth we have seen in brands like Jo Malone, Tom Ford is reinforcing the part of our portfolio which has the possibility of having great traction during the holiday. So we see improvements ,not only in our gift sets and in the promotionality of holidays, but we really see improvements also in the kind of portfolio choices that we can offer for gifts during the holiday period everywhere in the world. The other aspect that we are improving is that a lot of the holiday sales are going to be directed online, in our retail dot-com areas and online in general. And we continue to improve our online readiness for having a great gift season. Now for the other question, is New Dimension of Lauder was in line with the expectations around the world, including in the U.S., is particularly successful in the beginning in certain European markets. But in the UK, also was very successful as of July. And in U.S., I would say, more or less in line with expectations. And the impact on the overall skin care Lauder is positive. We see the New Dimension brings new consumers into the game. And so, we believe can have a good impact in the long term. However, last year during the same period, we had launched Advanced Night Repair eye product, that was a very successful initiative. So in some markets, including the United States, we see that New Dimension launch was not able to completely offset the Advanced Night Repair launch in the previous year. But again, we'll continue to grow and attract new consumers to the brand, in our estimate. Operator : Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. It's not entirely clear to me, because the first quarter was stronger than we expected, clearly on the top line and the bottom line, and much stronger than your guidance \u2013 why you wouldn't be raising the full-year numbers. I'm just trying to understand, was there more pipeline fill? Was it that shift \u2013 I know, Tracey, you mentioned a shift in some marketing expenses. Or is it that you feel incrementally cautious about the macro environment? Or are you just being wildly conservative with the second quarter and the full-year numbers? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Wendy, we're definitely not being wildly conservative with the numbers. We actually did, when you think about the fact that we maintained our full-year guidance and we talked about experiencing another $0.06, or expecting to experience another $0.06 of currency impact based on the current spot rates, indeed we did raise our guidance for the full year. So, we did flow some of the beat in the first quarter through to the full year. But it is a very uncertain macro environment and, as Fabrizio mentioned, there are many markets that are volatile right now, and currency still remains volatile right now. So, we were not comfortable flowing 100% of the beat through in the first quarter to the full year, but we certainly flowed a portion of it through. Operator : Your next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I have a couple things. One is, on the SG&A beat, based on lower spending. Given the commentary that we've heard for a while now about agility and nimbleness, is there any way to help us think about how much less volatile you may be today, given some of these kind of organizational capabilities you've built, about reacting more quickly and stuff? Because \u2013 and if you could be specific about what you've actually done. Because it has always been a concern, I think, among investors \u2013 among us as well \u2013 that you are not really a staple company, right, you're much more discretionary, so macro has to be much more concerning for you guys. Can you give us a sense of how your organizational capabilities have changed? And if you can tell us how much less volatile you might be, so we can be less concerned about macro, that might be helpful. Tough question, but love some context there. And then, second thing is around the dividend increase of 25% \u2013 good; again, I think that was 20% last year, so now 25% this time. How should we think about where you're funding that from? I mean, clearly, the payout ratio seems to be going up because the EPS growth, ex-currency, is 10% to 12%. Should we expect some more debt load? Lower stock buybacks? Is it just kind of the payout ratio going up, working capital improvements? How should we think about that from a signaling perspective, given your dividend's going up so much? Thanks, guys. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I'll take the first one and Tracey will cover the second one. So, in terms of volatility, the market has increased volatility. And that's why we have prepared ourselves to deal with this volatility better. So, the strategy that I keep repeating, the multiple engine of growth, is actually a clear strategy that internally, we are executing since several years. And now, this has reached to a point where we believe we are much less volatile than we used to be and more reliable and more sustainable than ever. This comes from the fact that by channel, we are today more diversified. For example, we have now 8% of our business online and some of our key markets like U.S. and U.K. is 12%. And in China, as we discussed, it is double digit, it is 10%. We have more business in our free-standing stores, particularly on certain brands and particularly in emerging markets. Meaning, that we have bettered the ability to build business in the emerging markets which are growing fast, even if in some cases, there is not available luxury distribution in those markets. And some of our brands have been designed to drive this accordingly. We are better diversified because now we are winning around the world much better in specialty-multi. We had mentioned our strong growth in the U.S. in Sephora or our strong growth in Europe in Douglas or in Boots in the U.K., and there are several examples in Asia as well. So, channel diversification is one example. Second, category diversification. We have now demonstrated that we are the market leader in global makeup. And so, even in the moment where the macro factor makes skin care grow less aggressively, particularly because skin care in Asia is growing less, we can definitely accelerate makeup and within makeup there are very profitable segments, so makeup that can be accelerated, that are equally profitable to skin care. We have demonstrated that in the fragrance business, creating these high-end fragrance part of the portfolio, which is profitable and growing fast like Jo Malone as a brand, that we can continue tapping into the growth of the fragrance strategy, but with a strategy which is more in tune with the Est\u00e9e Lauder company capability and long-term vision. And finally, diversification by brands. We are much less dependent only from Lauder and Clinique. First of all, M\u2022A\u2022C today is a brand which is as big as Lauder and Clinique. And then the rest of our portfolio of the small brands, now mid-size brands, all together, as I explained a lot of times, are actually bigger than our biggest brands. So we have now really multiple origins of growth, more diversified. So the first reason why we are less volatile is because there is not anymore one thing that can happen macro that can have a very big impact on our business because there will be others that we can accelerate to compensate this one. Second part to the answer is then, what do we do, what we have changed in terms of resource allocation? We have created internal system where we are much more capable of reallocating resources when we discover these trends or these changes on trends, and to make sure, for example, that we do not overspend if there are situations where the market doesn't deserve it because the market is under pressure. And so we can cut spending very fast where the market doesn't deserve to be pushed in a certain moment, or cut spending where initiative, a new launch is not delivering what we were expecting to avoid burning money that will not return. On the other side, we are also capable to increase spending in areas where there is strength and where there is growth or where the market offer an opportunity that was not forecasted before and we can do this in a range of months. And so our ability to reallocate resources with internal system in just a few months has increased dramatically versus the past. So in summary, we are more reliable, more sustainable, more long term and less exposed to external trend than ever because of our portfolio and because of our ability to reallocate resources in a pretty fast way. Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And so, to continue what Fabrizio said, one of the benefits of being able to execute well against our strategy inclusive of the agility, the diversity and the agility that we've created from executing in our strategy is that our free cash flow, as you all know, has increased quite dramatically over the last few years. We've seen a big acceleration in our free cash flow which has allowed us to take up the dividend as well as repurchase more shares every year, as we on an annual basis review and get approval from the board on terms of how much of our free cash flow will we distribute to the shareholders. Much of that cash is generated overseas, and so, we have taken on small amounts of debt as we have committed to that strategy. And we've also taken on debt, and as I've shared with you previously, we'll continue to take on debt for acquisitions as we need to in the future.

Powers - UBS Securities LLC Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, everybody. On today's call, we have Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our six-month and full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior-year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, and the discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. During the Q&A section, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results as constant currency sales also rose 8% and EPS was 17% higher before charges. Our company is helping to drive the momentum in global prestige beauty, which is resilient and growing despite significant economic volatility. We are strengthening our leadership by growing approximately twice as fast as the industry. Our success in this volatile environment has been driven by our broadly diversified business, powered by our multiple engines of growth, coupled with investment agility and strong execution. This was achieved thanks to our talented and experienced leaders and global workforce. We are not over-reliant of any one category, channel or country, which helped cushion us somewhat from regional slowdowns or political strife. We reacted quickly to unexpected events and volatility during the quarter and reallocated our investment spending, capitalizing on the best opportunities, as condition changed. To cite some examples, we reduced the investment in Hong Kong which continued to decline and increased support in Canada, the U.K. and other fast growth markets. As the makeup category surged globally, we invested more in M\u2022A\u2022C's terrific momentum and in popular launches for our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands to leverage their accelerating makeup growth. In travel retail, we accelerated our brand expansion into Europe, which enjoyed stronger traffic tourists. Seeing a growing demand in our direct-to-consumer business, we accelerated development of e-commerce sites and freestanding stores in several markets. Our strategy is to invest dynamically in our strengths, which added fuel to our momentum and helped us driving terrific results. Thanks to the strategic resource allocation, we had constant currency gains across the board of our regions and categories. By intentionally accelerating investment in selected winning areas, we generated a stronger results in our makeup and luxury brands, direct-to-consumer channels and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, where we gained significant share. Even with formidable competition, we believe we are expanding our leading position in skincare and makeup combined in Western Europe and in emerging markets in that region. Our strong overall results were especially encouraging in light of some difficult macro issues, including a depressed retail climate in Hong Kong and softer market growth in China, as well as worsening currency headwinds, especially in certain emerging markets. Although we expect economic and geopolitical volatility to continue throughout the balance of the fiscal year, we believe we can successfully navigate the instabilities because of our strong positions in the categories, channels and regions with the strongest sustainable growth. We anticipated many of the major trends driving global prestige beauty today. We are able to leverage the increasing growth the industry is experiencing in direct-to-consumer channels, such as online and retail stores, as well as travel retail and specialty stores category into a growing numbers of beauty consumers. We were a pioneer in online beauty, recognizing early on that the channel would be increasingly important for marketing, communication and shopping convenience. Today, we are among the largest and most established player in online prestige beauty and have enjoyed extraordinary growth. This fiscal year, we expect our online sales from our brand sites and retailer sites to top $1 billion for the first time, representing a doubling of the business in just three years. Our digital success comes from having a diverse entrepreneurial team, more than half of whom are millennials. And they quickly adapt to business, to changing landscapes. Our websites offer a desirable luxury experience and have become major contributors to brand growth. The holiday quarter was a valuable time for e-commerce as more consumers opted for the convenience of shopping online. Online sales accelerated for various product categories, and beauty was no exception. Our E&M commerce business captured the increased volume and generated nearly 30% growth in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, sales of our North America brand sites were more than 50% higher than last year. On Singles' Day in China, sales of our five flagship sites on Tmall more than doubled, led by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. Many global metrics of our brand sites improved, including the number of orders, which rose 27%. And mobile became an even larger portion of our sales, accounting for 36% of all online transactions. During the quarter, we added 69 brand retailers and third-party sites worldwide. Linking our brand sites to our freestanding store is key to enabling an omni-channel experience, which is an important evolving trend in retailing. We have launched numerous pilot programs and are building omni-channel capability to begin to seamlessly connect consumers across our brand sites and our freestanding stores globally. We are exploring many different approaches and learning what's successful. For example, we launched online booking for makeup services in the U.K. and the U.S. and are finding that over half of the appointments at M\u2022A\u2022C new makeup studio in Manhattan have been made online. In the U.K., several of our brands offer cross channel gift cards that can be redeemed online and in our freestanding stores. And in October, Bobbi Brown aired an interactive beauty class that generated more than 1.1 million social media impressions. Today, we have approximately 1,500 freestanding stores worldwide that are managed directly by our company or our partners. As we expand our number of highly productivity stores, we are testing new concepts. Origins discover retail design, which illustrates the journey from plan to product, is being rolled out globally. M\u2022A\u2022C's first makeup studio is a service-based store that we believe will provide an additional revenue stream. M\u2022A\u2022C freestanding stores are a key growth engine and account for approximately one-third of its global sales today. Leveraging a growing demand for prestige beauty in Brazil, two of our luxury brands are entering the country with standalone stores. La Mer recently opened in a luxury shopping mall in S\u00e3o Paulo, where it offers spa treatment. And Jo Malone will soon follow, one of the 30 stores it plans to add globally this fiscal year. Our M\u2022A\u2022C and Clinique brands have been a standing and freestanding store in Brazil now for several years. We also anticipated that specialty multi would be a fast growing beauty channel. In the quarter, our strongest sales growth in North America was in this channel, which saw robust retail sales through all our brands. Many of our brands are increasing their penetration with the appropriate retailers. As I mentioned on our last call, one of our exciting initiatives comes from the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand which will launch its Est\u00e9e Edit group of products in 320 North America Sephora stores and on Sephora.com in mid-March. Inspired by today's young consumers, the Est\u00e9e Edit line delivers instant visible benefits centered on the theme beauty is an attitude aimed directly at millennials and promoted on social media. The Est\u00e9e Edit is part of a strategic effort to modernize the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand for long-term growth and seed the next generation of consumer while continuing to appeal to its core consumers. Additionally, in Sephora, Bobbi Brown plans to add more doors in the U.S. this spring. And GLAMGLOW reinforced its popularity with the launch of lip treatment products, which become best sellers there. In international markets, La Mer launched in the makeup specialty chain in Australia, and in Europe Bumble and bumble and Smashbox had good growth in Boots. Douglas accounts for one-third of our business in Germany, and our retail sales there grew double digits in the quarter. Our brands continue to perform well also in higher-end department stores globally. However, in mid-tier North America department store, some of our brands are experiencing softness, although they showed solid increase online. Travel retail is another long-term growth engine of our business that improved in the channel as well. Importantly, in the quarter, our net sales, retail sales and traffic growth all grew mid-single digit. With changing travel patterns shifting where and what consumers buy, we redeployed some of our investment activities to the corridors with the most touristic traffic. Korea returned to growth after concerns about MERS eased and Europe was robust as the weak euro attracted tourists. Hong Kong remained soft, also in travel retail in China has did markets in the corridor \u2013 also in the corridors frequented by Russians and Brazilians. Overall, in travel retail, we had double-digit retail growth in half of our top 30 markets. Mirroring our broader company strategy, we continued to diversify our travel retail business by expanding our brands in more locations and opening more doors. The preorder business where travelers order products online and pick them up in the airports had a strong increase. Healthy passenger traffic growth is projected across all regions this fiscal year. Touching concern for the key geographies, the Korean market continued to rebound and our business is posting solid growth and gaining share, driven largely by our makeup brands which are set to be leveraging important Korean trends and demonstrating our ability to successfully compete with local brands. In China, nearly all our brands grew double digits. While prestige beauty growth slowed, our business there grew a solid 9%, exceeding growth in prestige. Our results reflect our strategy to diversify our business by expanding our portfolio channels, cities and products. Our makeup and fragrance business has been growing rapidly in what has traditionally been a skincare oriented market, demonstrating our strategy to align our multiple engines of growth with local market dynamics. The economic environment and beauty market growth in emerging markets overall has slowed. While we are not immune to soft local economic conditions, our business in emerging markets other than China continued to be very robust, rising 27% in the quarter, approximately three times the growth of prestige beauty in those countries. We are committed to these markets and plan to invest more in this time of softness to leverage our momentum, increase our market share, resulting in a much stronger position when these economies will improve again. Around the world, makeup proved again to be a strong growth engine, a trend that we had anticipated and prepared for, which is evident in our results. For the quarter, our makeup business grew 13% in constant currency. Our three makeup brands are clearly benefiting, M\u2022A\u2022C and Smashbox especially, up strong double digits. But so are our multi-category brands. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique makeup sales grew in every region. Foundation has been very strong across our brands, and we had four of the top five foundations in the U.S. in 2015. Among Est\u00e9e Lauder's best products was Double Wear Stay-in-Place Liquid Foundation, a strong seller decades after its launch. This core product was the best-selling foundation in the U.S. according to NPD for the quarter and also the 2015 calendar year, with sales up more than 20%. Clinique launched Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer in Asia, which established a new makeup pillar for the brand and drove strong foundation growth in the region. This success in foundation is one of the key factors driving improvement in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. We have chosen to reemphasize makeup in these brands to help ignite their businesses. Est\u00e9e Lauder progress in both modernizing the brand and emphasizing local relevant product drove its higher sales, particularly in certain Asian and European markets. While skincare is its largest business, especially in Asia, the brand's substantial makeup portfolio is attracting younger consumers. It is creating a vibrant digital strategy with newsworthy updates and enhanced storytelling to communicate with consumers 24/7. Clinique's greater emphasis on makeup, especially some color products, is creating a stronger emotional connection with millennials, which is helping to stabilize its performance and drive growth. It is announcing consultant training, distorting key products and testing in new store formats that's colorful, high energy, modular and engages consumers. The first pilot of the new freestanding store model opened in Hong Kong two months ago, and sales are up sharply in what has recently been a relatively depressed market. Our strategy of having multiple engines of growth extends to our innovation program, which develops desirable technologies and concepts across our product category and brands. Our innovation isn't just about creating big blockbusters and our success isn't based solely on the newness product for each brand. Instead, an important impact of our launches is to pull consumers into stores, build traffic and drive sales. Some shoppers do come to buy the latest lip shade, but many others gravitate on our staples, which accounts for the vast majority of our sales. Let me give you example of some recent and upcoming products by category. In skincare, Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask is a global launch with a focus on Asia where masks are extremely popular. This offers key ANR technology and extends this important franchise. Est\u00e9e Lauder's New Dimension serum was successful in many markets in Europe and Asia, offsetting lower than expected results in North America. La Mer introduced their Renewal Oil, a luxury entry in the popular facial oil subcategory and it has exceeded expectations in many markets. Clinique built a franchise around its Smart serum by extending it with moisturizer and treatment oils. In the makeup category, Skin Foundation have been strong sellers. Several of our brands, including Est\u00e9e Lauder and Bobbi Brown, are introducing cushion compacts, which is a growing segment and has been popular with consumers. The strong growth in our high-end fragrances brands is another important element of our strategy that is working very well. The combination of Tom Ford, Jo Malone and recent acquisitions are generating sustainable profitable growth and we continue to expand distribution and roll out exciting new scents. We have had a variety of fragrance launches across prestige points, and many of them, as well as attractive sets, were popular gifts for the holidays. With an eye towards spring, Jo Malone Herb Garden collection will offer five different colognes. Looking at the balance of our fiscal year, we are confident in our sound strategy and are choosing to increase investment in the strongest areas of our business. These investments will include more advertising, building freestanding stores and e-commerce sites, R&D and travel retail expansion. We are further fueling our growth momentum by investing in our winners and continues to build global market share. There are, of course, many macro factors beyond our control and slower markets to overcome. We believe, however, that our diversification, multiple engines of growth, strong innovation, financial agility and superb execution will generate excellent growth. We also continue working to find ways to better leverage this growth in the longer term. With this confidence, we are raising the lower end of our sales guidance and now expect to deliver 7% to 8% growth in constant currency, as well as continuing to forecast double-digit EPS growth for fiscal 2016, delivering another year of strong results while continuing to build sustainable, profitable growth engines. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our fiscal 2016 second quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. My commentary does exclude the impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales for the second quarter were $3.12 billion, up 8% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 70 basis points of this sales growth. Once again, the strongest geographic performance this quarter came from the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 13% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in virtually every market. A continuation of strong local demand for our products increased tourist traffic in certain cities, and our selective brand distribution expansion contributed to double-digit increases in all major Western markets. Sales growth in France was slower than last quarter, as the attacks in mid-November understandably curtailed both shopping and tourism in Paris. All emerging markets in the region saw double-digit gains led by Russia, Turkey and the Middle East. Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 5%, as double-digit gains in many countries and a strong return to growth in Korea were partially offset by continued declines in both Hong Kong and Brazil. Overall, passenger traffic growth is strong, and our growth at retail and net reflected the strength in the quarter. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. China rose 9% with e-commerce sales growing nearly 80%, thanks in part to the success of Singles' Day on November 11 when our sales more than doubled versus prior year. Our online sales for the quarter rose to nearly 13% of our total China business. We delivered solid growth in our core markets of Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller emerging markets in the region rose double digits. Australia also delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth. These strong results were partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong, where sales decreased by high single digits on top of a meaningful decline last year. A sharp continuation of a decline in tourist flows from China that began last year, combined with both the Chinese yuan devaluing this fiscal year and Chinese tourists continuing to travel more to other destinations in Europe and Asia is creating further weakness in local sales in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grown more than 8%. Net sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency. Strong double-digit growth continued across Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico. North American sales grew low single digits, which reflected double-digit growth in Canada and low single-digit growth in the U.S. Sales were strongest in the U.S. in specialty multi, online and high-end department store channels, while tourist driven doors in all channels have been adversely affected by the strong dollar. Our sales in mid-tier department stores continue to be soft in brick and mortar while the related retailer online business was up sharply. Our holiday sales were broadly in line with our expectations, although the environment this year was more promotional than the prior year. In constant currency, net sales in every product category grew this quarter, with double-digit growth in makeup, fragrance and hair care. Makeup sales rose 13% in constant currency. M\u2022A\u2022C, Tom Ford and Smashbox all rose strong double digits due to the success of key recent product launches, further distribution expansion and solid like-door growth. Tom Ford Lips & Boys collection, which originally launched last holiday season, continued to be particularly strong this year. Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder rose mid to high single digits in makeup, primarily due to strengthening their product offerings and their support behind the fast growing lip and foundation categories. Fragrance category sales rose 12% in constant currency during the important holiday gifting season. Double-digit gains from Jo Malone and Tom Ford and incremental sales from our newer brands, Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, drove the majority of the growth. Within other designer fragrances, Michael Kors Gold Collection and Tory Burch also contributed to growth and Est\u00e9e Lauder's Modern Muse Le Rouge, launched this fall, grew the overall Modern Muse franchise. Hair care sales increased 14% in constant currency with growth from both Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda launched Thickening Tonic and Shampure dry shampoo, which also benefited from continued growth in existing products such as Be Curly. The brand expanded its presence in travel retail and delivered strong salon growth in Western Europe, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in the specialty multi-channel. Skincare sales rose 2% in constant currency. Skincare continues to be the dominant beauty category in China and Hong Kong where there has been more challenging macro trends that have contributed to the category's slower global growth. La Mer rose double digits. Origins and Darphin generated solid growth and GLAMGLOW represented incremental sales growth in skincare. Est\u00e9e Lauder achieved modest growth due to recent launches and Clinique declined slightly in the quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was comparable to the prior year at 81.2% of sales. Favorabilities in our supply chain were offset by the combination of category mix, with a slower growth in skincare, and some higher promotional expenses over the holidays. Operating expenses as a percent of sales were in line with the prior year quarter at 60.4%. Increases were primarily due to higher store operating costs, which reflected over 130 new freestanding retail store openings over the past year, offset by improvements in selling, shipping and other expenses. As a result, operating income of $647.9 million was 2% above the prior year and operating margin was unchanged at 20.8%. Our constant currency operating margin improved 60 basis points primarily due to expense leverage. Net earnings were $458.6 million or 5% above the prior year quarter, reflecting a 230 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate, which was partially driven by a discrete tax credit in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.22 was 8% above the prior year, including the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger than expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of better sales performance across most of our brands and continued strong expense management as we navigated the volatile macro environment. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.01 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.11 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 18%. We recorded $18.5 million in charges before tax, or $0.03 per share, for the transition of our global technology infrastructure to a new platform that we announced to you last quarter. As we mentioned previously, for the full fiscal year we expect to record charges for this transition of between $40 million and $50 million before tax, or approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per share. Continued progress in our working capital initiatives, along with favorable currency translation, contributed to a seven-day improvement in inventory days to sell through the end of December. These improvements were partially offset by the inventory build necessary to meet our future sales growth objectives and the additional inventory from our new brands. For the six months ended December 31, we generated $962 million in cash flows from operating activities, 3% less than the comparable period last year. The prior year cash flow benefited from the SMI sales shift. Excluding the impact of the shift from last year, operating cash flow this year rose 17%. We invested $223 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support new retail stores, counters, systems and office space. We utilized $628 million in cash to repurchase approximately 7.6 million shares of our stock, 1.2 million more than the same period last year. We also distributed $201 million in dividends to stockholders. So that concludes our results for the second quarter and the half year. Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year and the third quarter. For the full year, the sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year. I will now discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift impact, are available in today's earnings release for your reference. Also excluded, again, for the full year is the impact of restructuring and other charges. So, reflecting our strong first half performance, we have raised the low end of our guidance range and now expect full year sales growth of between 7% and 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency has become an even greater headwind, and we now estimate that translation could negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately five percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of January of 1.08 for the euro, 1.43 for the pound, and 1.18 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.07 and $3.12, including $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions. The increased currency headwinds are now projected to affect EPS by about $0.29, which is $0.05 more than we projected when we last gave guidance. Our strong first half performance gave us comfort to increase our investments in the second half of the fiscal year to support new innovation, additional freestanding store acceleration, omni-channel pilots, travel retail and the Est\u00e9e Edit, which should allow us to continue to fuel profitable growth. And while we remain on track to deliver $200 million of cost savings this year, we will also continue to look for ways to further improve our leverage in the future. We continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12% in constant currency. In the third quarter, our sales are expected to rise 6% to 7% in constant currency, including 70 basis points from acquisitions as we anniversary our strongest sales growth quarter from last year. The impact of foreign currency is anticipated to reduce growth by approximately four percentage points. Our third quarter diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.53 and $0.58, including approximately $0.03 per share of adverse currency translation and approximately $0.02 dilution from acquisitions. This estimate reflects our highest quarter of planned advertising and promotional spending as a percent of sales in the third quarter and is deployed behind key activities such as the global launch of Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask, the U.S. introduction of the Est\u00e9e Edit collection in Sephora as well as a variety of activities in the makeup category across multiple brands. We delivered strong sales and earnings growth and showed solid progress on our strategic initiatives in the first half of the fiscal year while managing through a volatile global macro environment. We are encouraged by our results thus far and the scope of activities we have planned throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, which should support our continued growth momentum for this fiscal year and beyond. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Good morning. I wanted to pick up on the theme of agility, which was the center of the discussion we had a couple of months ago, and you began by calling it out again today. So really two questions, if I could, related it to. First, Fabrizio, can you maybe talk about some of the structural steps you've taken to enable that flexibility? Because I think there is some debate out there as to how much of what we are seeing is innate skill and a function of institutionalized discipline versus simply you benefiting from a spate of good luck that might eventually run out. That will be my first question. And then second, Tracey, can you talk about how the theme of agility relates to your ability to protect margins and profit? Because I am struck by the fact that here we are, you just beat the top end of your Q2 guidance by $0.14 and none of that is being passed through to your full year guidance to insulate the P&L from incremental FX pressure. And maybe that is prudent on your part. I am inclined to think that it is, but at the same time I just thought that with the top line strength, all the pricing levers you have, some of your productivity efforts that there would be more ability to be nimble and agile on that front as well and avoid the guide down. So I would just love your thoughts there too. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Now, on agility, as we discussed, so, first of all, we monitor the changes around the world. So the first institutional model is a continuous monitoring all the changes. Example, traveling corridor of tourist full, market growth in different levels. We have now new level of analytics and follow-up on how the business evolves. So understanding. The second institution is then we tailor launches \u2013 product launches, assortment and things based on what we learn regularly. Third is when markets over-deliver their financial trends, they get more opportunity to spend. And when they market then to under-deliver, they tend to cover at least part of what they cover for the profit pressure that they are under. So these automatic mechanisms are anyway generating flows or resources automatically to the winning part of our business. Third, the way people collaborate is completely different today. We collaborate, we make decision together and so the ability to flow in an agile way, both resources and money, and make fast decision on locations is taken at the top of the company in a collaborative way. Those are institutional way, which are here to stay. And actually they are a \u2013 the way we work across every quarter. So assume that we \u2013 once we decide a plan, we constantly work to improve it, quarter-by-quarter, months-by-months. And the company does this in a structural way. Second point before Tracey answer the second part of your question, I would like to say that in reality, what we are doing is focusing even more on growth, even in the second semester. We have so many winning opportunity and our location methodologies are working. And our ability to build the top line in a sustainable way for the long-term is definitely the most important priority for sustainable double digit EPS growth in the long-term. So our point of view is that moving the lower end of our top line sales trend from the 6% to 8% \u2013 we have 6% to 8%. So moving from closer to the 6% to closer to the 8% in a sustainable way has much more value for our shareholders in the long-term than just covering currencies in the short term. So our approach is to focus on long-term top line growth acceleration. And in a moment where the environment out there is volatile, and we have proven that in volatile environment, we have a competitive advantage in being able to operate, we want to leverage that momentum and get this competitive advantage through. That's what we're doing. That's why we have decided not to cover currency. We trim the investment in the short term that we didn't feel was the long-term priority. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And so I think Fabrizio answered it well, Steve, but I will just add on that while Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are ahead some good signs in terms of the first quarter, they have some great programs lined up for the second quarter that we think are worthwhile investing in. If we didn't have good opportunities to invest in, in the second half, we would certainly drop the upside to the bottom line. But as Fabrizio said, we have tremendous momentum in many of our brands. We have good programs in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique that we think will deliver good results in the second half of the year, and beyond. So it's important for us to invest not only for this fiscal year but obviously to continue the growth momentum beyond this fiscal year. Operator : Your next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hello, Dana? Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hello. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hello. Hi. Congratulations and wanted to get a better understanding of channel penetration, given that specialty multi is growing so fast. What does it mean for distribution of the business? What percentage could it account for over time? And how does that impact margins go forward? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So, specialty multi is growing well globally. And what it means for our distribution that we are increasing distribution globally with our brand portfolio in specialty multi where appropriate. So you can expect a global increase of distribution gradually in this channel. However, we also learning how to win in this channel. So it's not only a distribution game, it's also a marketing game. This channel requires different marketing and selling techniques than the traditional department store core business that we have around the world. And so over time, I believe our organization is becoming better and better in partnering with specialty retailers around the world and learning how to grow our business in this channel better and better. The first thing is so you can expect that the percentage of our business in which channel will grow, but this is very different by country around the world depending on the penetration of this channel. So, I will not give frankly detail on percentages, also because they will be very much the results of mix by geographies rather than on specific advancement in a given brand or in a given country. Tracey, I don't know if you want to talk. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I think you answered it well. Operator : Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Could you give us a little bit more color on the Est\u00e9e Edit? So it is going into 320 doors. How many SKUs is that? Can you give us some sense for how large a contribution to the revenue growth in the third quarter that will be? Is it 50 bps or whatever? Is it skincare and color or just color? And are there plans to expand it either to more Sephora doors or Ulta doors or any of the department doors as we go forward? And then, just following up on that, second of all, can you remind us or tell us; I don't think I heard it, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder, are you still expecting them as big brands to be up for fiscal 2016? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. A lot of questions. So on Est\u00e9e Edit \u2013 so, first of all, Est\u00e9e Edit is exclusive to Sephora and will be launching Sephora brick and mortar and Sephora.com. And it's been developed also in strict collaboration with the Sephora teams. The Est\u00e9e Edit is focused on makeup, but includes also some \u2013 how we call it, instant skincare benefit products. To us some core SKUs of Est\u00e9e Lauder business. This brand will be supported by a very strong social media and very strong digital activities, really focused on the millennials and incorporation also in magazines that support the magazine and social media activity. So it will be a strong launch. In terms of the impact for the long term, obviously, it will depend from the success. We have a very strong belief that this will be a strong success. And in case of success, we assume it will be expanded to more Sephora doors over time, obviously. But we will need first to test and see the success level that we get. Now, in terms of the quarter, remember, this is launched in March 15 at mid-March, so the impact on third quarter is relatively limited. But we hope that the impact on fiscal year 2017 and 2018 will be \u2013 obviously be much stronger when success will happen. The other important aspect of Est\u00e9e Edit is that it is not only going to be hopefully a success in sales, but is also very important way to attract millennials to the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand and is one of the steps to modernize the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand as a whole in our opinion. On Lauder and Clinique, the Lauder and Clinique combined grew about 1% in the quarter two, so \u2013 which is a turnaround. This was in quarter two specifically, it was driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder growth as Tracey explained in her remarks. But the important point is that both Lauder and Clinique are growing again on their makeup business, which is in the case of the Clinique a very big percentage; in the case of Lauder is more the percentage of total business because of the big Asia penetration of skincare, but still in many countries is the bigger part of the business of these two brands. So that's the important reality. We said that we would have started turning around to grow these two brands starting from makeup and then fall into skincare. On skincare, it's frankly difficult to imagine that skincare will also start growing again within this fiscal year with Hong Kong in the situation in which it is and with the China market growth in skincare being so soft. As I said before, China market growth is mainly driven by makeup in this moment, and the skincare is not growing very aggressively. So \u2013 but as soon as the Asia skincare dynamic will find back a normalized growth, we will complete the turnaround also on the skincare front of these two brands. That's our assumption for the fiscal year. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about gross margins, so flat sequentially for the second straight quarter. Just curious, you talked about promotional activity in China and the press release talked about just general levels of promotional activity around the holiday period. How much did that impact gross margins in the quarter? Were there other drivers as well? As you sort of think longer term, is modest expansion still reasonable? And then, sort of related to all that, I guess just back to the previous question, so there is clearly going to be some mix effect, I would assume, from skincare. So, how does that factor in as well? Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Great questions. So, promotion affected the margins slightly in the quarter. The bigger impact in terms of it being flat year-over-year was the category mix as you indicated. So tremendously strong growth in makeup and much softer growth in skincare and fragrance as well, so strong growth in fragrance. Those two factors do affect our category, or our gross profit margin mix. In terms of the future, yes, we do expect to see some modest improvement in gross profit margin over the next few years, not to the extent that we saw four years or five years ago, but certainly a continuation of modest improvement over the next few years. Operator : Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I was curious about the travel retail stepping up investments there because I feel like from an external perspective and some of your competitors, if anything, there is more concern about travel retail being a soft spot and I think even questions around whether we will see a resurgence when and if some of those wealthier emerging-market travelers start shopping again. And yet, you talked about increasing your investment in travel retail distribution. So, can you talk a little bit about that decision? Is it new airports? Is it new brands in some of your existing corridors? Just any color there would be great. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely. So, first of all, we are applying to travel retail the same multiple engines of growth, diversification and investment agility philosophy that we are applying to the entire company. So as you said, travel retail has been having some outstanding momentum for years based on the Asian travelers' acceleration. And in this moment, the Asian dynamic, particularly the Hong Kong-Macau one, which is the worrying one and it's been soft, very soft in quarter two, we predicted the softness to stay in that part. But in reality, it's not the traffic which is declining. It is where consumers are going and how much they're shopping. So we are reacting to that. We are increasing brand distribution, yes. We are increasing penetration of airports where the traffic is going now, meaning more Europe and more other areas of Asia, for example. We are adjusting assortments to the new corridor, to the new traveling corridor. So give you an example. At the moment, Brazilians don't travel any more as much as they used to. And when they travel, they shop less. We adjust assortments. And in these places like Miami, now there are more different kind of travelers to which we adjust. And maybe there are other brands that today are not there that are better suited with different group of travelers there. So the previous brands that we had before that were maybe more suited to Brazilians, as an example. This is happening all over the world. So it's adjustment in assortment, is increase our number of brands, is penetration of more airports, and most importantly, is a dynamic adjustment to the corridor travelers. So that's the first theme, which is about traffic management. The second theme is about commercial. And what is changing is that all these currency changes in travel retail, the currency changes are changing the dynamic of the duty-free aspect, the discounts the consumer found around the world versus their home market. And that's why, for example, makeup is growing much better in travel retail. Makeup is much more purchased because of the commercial marketing from travelers to buyers rather than for big discounts. Also they get discounts for these in absolute terms, much smaller. So we are learning to increase some categories in travel retail where we were not as penetrated as we were in skincare, like some makeup. We are learning that our high-end fragrances like Jo Malone are extremely successful in travel retail. So we are expanding the high-end, the sophisticated artisanal fragrances, including our new acquisition would be part of that. That is a very big opportunity. Also because as you know, fragrance is a very big market in travel retail and we are learning more marketing techniques to convert traveler into purchaser based \u2013 for example of M\u2022A\u2022C is adding makeup artists. Jo Malone is adding gifts methodologies in travel retail. So making sure there are more reasons to buy in travel retail than just lower prices than in the home markets. So that's the entire strategy. It's a pretty sophisticated strategy. And as everything we are doing is about the long-term sustained growth of this very important and profitable channel. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Since we are talking about travel retail, I guess I will start there. Obviously, a big turnaround this quarter for your sales, although retail sales have been pretty good for the last few quarters. Is this an indication that the inventory adjustments we have seen in the past are now behind us or was this sort of a one-time blip in the quarter? And then secondly, on skincare, up 2% constant currency. Obviously, the market conditions of Hong Kong and China are not helping you, but how does that 2% compare to category growth overall? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I'll answer the first part of the question, which is basically, yes. We believe in this moment, as we said, the net-in and sellout retail seems to be aligned. Remember that the \u2013 part of this alignment that was caused by the MERS event in Korea, so we cannot eliminate the risk that more events like this will happen, or flus or things in other parts that will disrupt the relationship between net and retail in the future. But for the moment, I believe we are in a situation where they are realigned. And in absence of new disrupting event, hopefully, they will stay aligned. Tracey, you want to address... sorry. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The skincare \u2013 I think the second question was skincare versus \u2013 the skincare growth in travel retail versus the category. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, right. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And as you might well know that our skincare travel retail business is heavily driven by Asia and Asian markets and Asian traveling consumers, so we did see softness in the Hong Kong and China part of our travel retail business that was largely related to skincare. We also saw some softness in Brazil that was more related to makeup. But for skincare, definitely, the Hong Kong/China softness impacted the category in travel retail. Yeah. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But I wanted again to stress what I said before that makeup is growing. The M\u2022A\u2022C brand travel retail trend is outstanding and the Joe Malone, for example, or the Tom Ford, so our high-end fragrances are really, really doing well. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : So my question is on emerging markets, specifically, where you guys have delivered outstanding growth. What is your outlook for the year, broadly? And I am curious how that may have changed or may not have changed over the past three months to six months, given the difficult macro? And specifically, do you still think you can deliver this mid to high 20% growth that we have been accustomed to, just the fact the comparisons become more difficult in the third quarter? So any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the \u2013 sorry the question was the other markets, the other emerging markets? Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Other emerging markets. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, the other emerging markets, the China, that grew 30% in the first quarter grew 27% for us in the second quarter, and anyway this is three times the growth of these markets. So, we are growing market share by design in the emerging markets around the world from Mexico to Brazil, to Turkey, to South Africa, to India, to the Middle East. And in all these markets, we are growing double-digit. As we said, China is not in this group but when we say China, which is growing 9% and the rest of the emerging markets 27%. And I think we will continue. Actually as I said in my remarks, we plan to continue to invest for growth and beat market share in this market even if in some of them the currency issues is creating some economical issues in these markets. We will take the opportunity to further increase our market share in this moment, because also it can be done in a very efficient way and hopefully get the benefits of this when this market will go back to more normal economic growth. So it's a good momentum, our brands are loved, and the opportunities in front of us are enormous. And so if the question was, can this kind of growth be sustained? I believe, yes. This kind of growth can be sustained for the long time. Operator : Your next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I'm sorry. I have three questions, but they are relatively straightforward. One is, just going back to the agility, I want to better understand how you are organizationally structured to do that. So who is actually responsible for the dynamic resource allocation? Is it centralized? Is it decentralized? So some more color there would be interesting because it seems to really be helpful to you guys. Number two is \u2013 and it may relate to the first question or it may not, is your SG&A ex-advertising spend still seems relatively high here. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much opportunity you think there is there, especially perhaps as you become more nimble. Typically, that is fewer layers, fewer heads, et cetera, so some ideas there. And then, the third piece is something completely different, just about the fragrances. I guess two of the 12 fragrances that remain with P&G, Dolce & Gabbana and, I guess to a lesser extent, Christina Aguilera, and your interest in those, given what you are seeing trend wise in fragrances recently. Thanks. Sorry for the three. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I'll answer the first and the third, and let Tracey answer the second. So, how our methodology works. First of all, it is about how we are structured. So \u2013 but the short answer is centralized. This decision is pretty centralized. We have monthly meetings where the finance team with Tracey at the head and the group presidents, which are \u2013 we have two group presidents take care of the region, or they go to market, and two group presidents take care of the combination of the brands. These four people plus Tracey and me centrally have basically complete control of the business and the resource allocation. And we review the opportunity and make decisions centrally in the same room on a very agile way. And that's I think the key topic. Then how technically that this work, frankly, it will \u2013 be more time than eight minutes on a call. But that's the key idea. It's centralized by six people. Second question, actually, your third question on fragrances. Again, I want to insist, we have declared that in this moment our priorities are high end fragrances on brand assets that we own like Jo Malone and that's why the acquisition of Le Labo. That is our priority; that stays our priority. This part of high end brand own seasonal fragrances model are very profitable, are growing at a smaller but fast growing part of the business which is very well suited to the Est\u00e9e Lauder company portfolio. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Ali, regarding your second question on costs outside of advertising, yes, we do believe we have further opportunity in those areas. Most of our cost saving programs this year, some of them were targeted at A&P effectiveness, many were targeted outside of that with selling productivity and other cost saving initiatives. And we think there is further opportunity, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to leverage expenses going forward with some of the process improvement initiatives that we have put in place this year that should yield some benefits in the future. Operator : We have time for one more question, please, Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you so much. Good morning. I was interested in just digging a little deeper into China, if I might. It used to be that prices were \u2013 I mean, I think at least 50% above, say, the United States. And I just wondered with some of the price changes that had gone into place, how much the price premium is in China today, on an average? And if you could just maybe walk around differentiating between Tier 1 cities, other cities, and obviously your online is doing very well, but where are the real pockets of weakness in China and what are the opportunities to change that even in the face of a soft consumer? Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, first of all, on pricing, in China, we have decreased the pricing, as you probably know, some time ago. And after the price decrease, the currency in China continues to devaluate. So in reality, the price differentials are much diminished on our brands. And I cannot tell you an average because it doesn't \u2013 but they are 10%, 15% in some cases, or 30%, 35% in other cases by SKU depending on many different dynamics. But they're much more reduced than they used to be in the past. So, the second part is where are the strengths, the weakness of China? Our strategy in China, like the one I explained for travel retail, is about diversification. So China is softer in this moment in the biggest skincare segment, is softer in the biggest cities; Shanghai, Beijing. Is \u2013 while China growth is very strong in Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, it's very strong online. It's very strong in smaller brands which are entering in areas in makeup and fragrances, which are fast-growing categories for this population. So again, it's about diversification. If you have multiple engines of growth, you can operate in new cities. You can operate online. You can operate in new growing segments like some makeup and some fragrance, high-end fragrance segments. There is an enormous amount of growth opportunity in China. And that is the diversification, multiple engine of growth work that we are doing also there and which are driving our results. Just to give you a number, our online business grew 80% in total in China during quarter two. 80%; 80. So it is a very strong acceleration, and that's what is the focus of our activity of creating the right engines of growth also in China for the long-term.

Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcasted. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Fabrizio and Tracey will review our third quarter results and full-year outlook and then discuss the new initiative we announced this morning called Leading Beauty Forward. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our nine-month and full-year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior-year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, and the discussion of our financial results and expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find the reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered solid performance with strong gains, particularly from our makeup category and international business. In constant currency, sales grew 6% and earnings per share rose 5%, before charges, to $0.76. Based on our results to-date, we are on track to achieve our sales and earnings guidance for the full fiscal year, excluding charges. We continue to benefit from a highly diversified business with multiple engines of growth and the flexibility to move investment quickly to support areas that provide the best returns. We continued to fuel makeup, a vibrant category, where we have achieved constant currency double-digit gains every quarter this fiscal year. Social media is helping to drive makeup sales with how-to-do videos, tips from consumers that influence us, and beautiful visuals of makeup transformations. Our company has thousands of talented makeup artists, who are a competitive advantage for our brands and help drive consumption through personal lessons in-store as well as online, where they can demonstrate the artistry to a broader audience. M\u2022A\u2022C Instagram, for example, features photos submitted by its global artists, illustrating their creativity and talents tied to products and trends. This kind of social media interaction creates an ongoing dialog between the brand and its consumers and helped drive sales. We are the largest company in global prestige makeup, and all our makeup brands grew this quarter. Each of our three diverse makeup-focused brands has a distinct character and channel profile. For example, one-third of M\u2022A\u2022C sales came from its free-standing stores. A majority of Bobbi Brown sales came from global department stores, and Smashbox has a strong presence in specialty-multi retailers. And there is further opportunity for growth across all prestige channels. In addition to its popular fragrance collections, our Tom Ford brand has a fast-growing and much-desired makeup business. Sales of Tom Ford luxury makeup products rose more than 50%. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique also achieved global growth in their makeup portfolios. Est\u00e9e Lauder delivered good momentum in the European region as its Double Wear foundation continued to be a strong seller. In North America, the brand launched the Est\u00e9e Edit exclusively in Sephora stores and on Sephora.com. The Millennial-targeted line generated terrific media attention and there is a full cadence of strong promotional activities planned throughout the fourth quarter. At Clinique, the brand extended its successful Pop Lip colour collection with new formulas and attracted young consumers with a digital campaign that included interactive music videos with a rising Swedish pop star. Growth in fragrance continued to come from our luxury scents. Jo Malone and Tom Ford had terrific results. Both brands generated double-digit growth in every region. The success of these brands supports our strategy to position our fragrance portfolio towards the profitable higher-end tier, an area where we are gaining share. Our artisanal luxury fragrance brands, Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, contributed higher sales, as did the AERIN collection of fragrances. Recently we acquired By Kilian, a sophisticated Paris-based brand that we believe further strengthens our leadership in fast-growing luxury fragrances. Turning to our geographies, our international business was stellar, and virtually every market grew. During the quarter, I visited several countries to gauge consumer sentiment and visit stores. One trip was in the UK, which had robust sales in the quarter, far exceeding prestige beauty growth. While there, I spent time in Birmingham and saw how our brand successfully tailored their product to the city's diverse multicultural population. Consumers in the UK have a great passion for beauty and our brands have responded in ways that appeal to a wide range of demographics, which has helped to re-enforce our leadership position in this market. The European region remained robust with growth in nearly every country and particularly strength in Italy, where all brands contributed with double-digit increase. The tragic attacks in Paris, Turkey and Brussels understandably dampened some tourist activities in the quarter. But, I'm proud of the tremendous strength and resilience our organization in this country showed during these very difficult times. Although, fewer tourists contributed to a falloff in retail sales in French airports following the Paris attack, our total net sales in travel retail for the quarter were strong, enjoying the results of our diversification strategy by region, category, brand, and type of airport. And retail sales in the channel were solid and broad-based. They rose double-digits in-house of the top 30 travel retail markets in the world. Currency fluctuations continued to affect travel patterns in our travel business. We continued to see stronger growth in some markets where the currency was weakened, including Japan, Australia or Canada, due to a greater number of inbound tourists. Weak currencies in Brazil and Russia led to a decline in travel by those populations and affected sales in the travel corridors that they frequent. However, local market sales in these two countries grew double-digits as more consumers purchased products close to their homes. I just returned from Korea a few days ago and was amazed by the energy and excitement there that beauty produces. Since the fear of MERS has abated, tourists are returning, especially the Chinese. Our business in Korea has turned around very nicely from a year ago, up double-digits this quarter, and I was very pleased to see that we are gaining share. Demand for makeup is accelerating strongly and our brands are successfully competing head-to-head with Korean brands. Four of our brands introduced cushion compacts, which are extremely popular with Korean consumers. Bobbi Brown's cushion compact did so well, it became 15% of its Korea business and contributed to the brand's foundation sales doubling in the country. During my visit, I partners at Dr. Jart+, an impressive brand that is seeing strong demand, and gleans insights into consumer desires and opportunities for growth. As I visited the stores in Seoul, I couldn't help but notice that sales of artisanal luxury fragrances are booming, including our own Jo Malone brand. I'm excited about the opportunity this trend holds for the newer fragrance brands in our portfolio. We recently launched GLAMGLOW in Korea, and avid consumers are actively using social media to talk about the brand and post photos. Korea is a center of innovation for beauty, and there are many new trends and ideas that our brands can leverage and bring to consumers in other areas of the world. Looking now at our emerging markets, our China business was healthy as most brands grew solidly and retail sales gained momentum. The online channel had the fastest growth and accounted for nearly 10% of sales. Sales in makeup and fragrance continued to accelerate, creating greater diversification in our Chinese business. As an example, Jo Malone business more than doubled, with strong momentum in both department stores and freestanding stores. Our other emerging markets continued to generate excellent growth, rising 20%. Among the best performance were South Africa or Brazil. M\u2022A\u2022C continues to be a trail-blazer in sub-Saharan Africa as introduced prestige beauty products and personalized services. It has entered many countries in this area, most recently Zambia. To fuel our company's global momentum, we continued investing in fast-growing channels. We opened new freestanding stores and launched several E&M commerce sites for our brands, mostly with retailers. GLAMGLOW, for example, began selling its products on Nordstrom's website. We also increased our presence in specialty-multi. In the U.S., Clinique continued expanding in Ulta, Est\u00e9e Lauder launched its Est\u00e9e Edit product line in Sephora, and several brands added more locations in Bluemercury. Isetan opened a new specialty-multi store concept in Shanghai, and several of our brands are present. Our creativity and innovation were central to accomplishments in the quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask was well received, particularly in Asia, and boosted the brand's important Advanced Night Repair franchise. Clinique Pep-Start Eye Cream, which brightens and primes the eye area for makeup, debuted exclusively in Sephora in the United States and was the number one eye cream there in February and March. Beyond products, our brand continued to forge creative collaborations. M\u2022A\u2022C is designing a makeup collection inspired by the singer Selena. And Est\u00e9e Lauder is teaming up with fashion designer Victoria Beckham for a full cosmetic collection. This collaboration brings great vast to our brand, especially on social media, and we expect them to draw new consumers. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey to give more details on the quarter. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will briefly review our fiscal 2016 third quarter results and then I will cover our expectations for the full-year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales for the third quarter were $2.66 billion, up 6% in constant currency compared to the prior-year. Our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 10 basis points of this sales growth. As Fabrizio mentioned, our international business remained quite strong as nearly all of our international markets grew this quarter, led by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 11% in constant currency with double-digit growth in most developed and emerging markets. The region continues to benefit, in part from the weak euro, making it a more attractive tourist destination, as well as from the benefits of strong execution of its strategic initiatives. The UK, Nordic and Italy were the largest contributors to growth among the developed markets in the region, and the Middle East, Russia, South Africa and Central Europe led double-digit gains in emerging markets in the region. Our online business was particularly strong across all EMEA markets this quarter. Our net sales and the global travel retail channel rose 9%, reflecting strong retail trends in most countries in Europe and Asia, which were partially offset by continued net sales declines in Hong Kong, Brazil and the United States. Overall passenger traffic growth in travel retail across all regions remained solid, despite shifts in consumption patterns between countries due to currency. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Every market in the region grew except Hong Kong, which was down double-digits. Korea was the largest contributor to net sales growth, rising 14% in the quarter, followed closely by Japan, Australia and Taiwan. China rose 5%, led by 70% growth in E&M commerce sales. Online sales across all APAC markets rose sharply this quarter. Our net sales in Hong Kong declined more than we had anticipated as tourists from the Chinese mainland continued to decrease. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grown nearly 9%. Net sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency. Brazil, Mexico and Canada all saw strong double-digit growth. As currencies in these countries continue to weaken against the dollar, local market consumption remained strong. Sales in the U.S. rose low single-digits. Continued strength in our online business, specialty-multi and high-end department store channels were largely offset by sharp declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued softness in traffic in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores. Once again, makeup sales led product category growth, rising 11% in constant currency. Double-digit growth from M\u2022A\u2022C, Smashbox and Tom Ford led the increase, while particular strength in the lip and foundation categories drove makeup growth at Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder this quarter. Sales of fragrance products rose 7% in constant currency. Double-digit gains from our luxury portfolio, Jo Malone, Tom Ford and Le Labo contributed the majority of the growth. The Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch stood out among the designer fragrances. This strength at the high-end of the fragrance category was partially offset by lower fragrance sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder and the remaining designer fragrances. Hair care sales increased 3% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from initial shipments of its new Invati for men products as well as higher sales of more recent launches and existing products. The brand opened new doors in travel retail and added salons and freestanding stores in Europe. Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in all channels. Skin care sales were flat in constant currency, reflecting the continued weakness in Hong Kong and the ongoing shift in increased consumer spending from skin care to makeup. Additionally, Est\u00e9e Lauder's skin care business declined slightly in the quarter due to tough comparisons with prior-year launches in the U.S. and in Asia. There were many bright spots in our portfolio for skin care. La Mer and Origins grew skin care double-digits, as did skin care lines of our M\u2022A\u2022C and Bobbi Brown makeup brands. Our gross margin increased 50 basis points to 81% of sales. The improvement came primarily from supply chain savings and lower promotional expenses, partially offset by channel and category mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points to 66% compared to the prior-year quarter. Selling and store operations costs to support our retail store growth, as well as general and administrative costs primarily from employee-related costs, consulting fees and our prior acquisitions, drove most of the increases. These were partially offset by our value creation from our Strategic Modernization Initiative and a deferral of some advertising and promotional expenses to the fourth quarter to support higher expected sales growth in that quarter. As a result, operating income decreased less than 1% to $399.2 million, and operating margin fell 60 basis points to 15%, due entirely to foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3%. Net earnings also decreased approximately 1% below the prior-year quarter to $274.9 million. Diluted EPS of $0.73 was 2% above the prior-year, reflecting the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of continued expense management and a delay in some advertising and promotional spending for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique to the fourth quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter include $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 5%. Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year. The sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact full-year comparisons to the prior-year. I will discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift, as always. Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift impact, are available in today's earnings release. Also excluded is the impact of restructuring and other charges. For the full-year, we expect sales to continue or to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full-year sales growth by approximately five percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of April of $1.14 for the euro, $1.44 for the pound, and $1.09 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year. Diluted EPS is now expected to range between $3.09 and $3.14, or $0.02 more than our last guidance range, reflecting a slight moderation in the currency impact. Adverse currency translation is now projected to affect EPS by about $0.27. Excluding the currency impact, we continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Our EPS range includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. Our strong performance to-date gives us the confidence to invest more in the fourth quarter to support additional advertising and promotion, primarily for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. While we continue to pursue value creation from our SMI program, which is now expected to deliver $175 million of cost savings this year, we also look for ways to further improve our cost leverage in the future. Fabrizio will now discuss the initiative we announced in our press release today. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Tracey. The multi-faceted initiatives that we call Leading Beauty Forward is designed to provide additional fuel for long-term growth and profitability. It will build on our strong foundation and leverage capabilities we have developed in important areas, driving our business, including digital, retail and creative. Leading Beauty Forward will support the continuing success of our strategy in an increasingly fast-paced, complex and competitive prestige beauty environment. It is designed to sustain our momentum by reducing costs and freeing up more resources to invest in brands, capability and most profitable opportunities, while better leveraging our growth. As we look toward the future, we believe the best way to capture the growth opportunity of tomorrow is being proactive today. This initiative is a carefully-measured next step in our long-term strategy that will allow us to continue to lead in the prestige beauty industry. We expect Leading Beauty Forward to sustain our sales, operating margin and earnings per share growth beyond the goals we have set throughout fiscal year 2018. Clearly, how we do business today and how we must be prepared to do business in the future is very different from what it was just seven years ago when we launched our current strategy. The fast-moving landscape requires a mindset and a way of operating that increases speed and flexibility, is creative, streamlined, cost-efficient and designed to serve global consumers in new ways. To that end, as part of Leading Beauty Forward, we plan to redesign select areas of our go-to-market organizations in the regions, affiliates and brands to increase agility and strengthen their capabilities. As more of our consumer engagement moves to digital platforms, the markets will need the tools and authority to respond quickly to opportunities and bring our expertise in local relevance closer to consumer. Stronger skills in innovation, digital, social media and creative capabilities will allow them to differentiate our unique brands even further by tailoring products and services to specific consumer segments and channels. We also will redesign select corporate functions to increase their efficiencies by making them leaner, scalable and less costly, while continue to deliver excellent services to our brand and businesses. We are evaluating the creation of a global and regional shared services among certain functions to simplify processes and focus on more strategic activities. We also plan to continue to optimize some of our supply chain operation to create a more efficient structure. These actions are expected to reduce our operating expenses, freeing up resources to invest in our brands, channel, consumer-facing activities and potential acquisitions. An important goal of Leading Beauty Forward is to support and grow our brands. To accomplish this, we will invest in activities that will resonate with consumers, including innovation to develop new product and services, unique point of sales assets, effective social media dialogs and compelling advertising. We will also support our newly-acquired brands to expand their presence and products and continue to build our small-size and medium-size brands, so they become leaders in the industry. As employees focus more fully on being creative and strategic, we will enhance our learning and development programs, so they have the best skills to lead in critical areas. The redesign will regrettably include reducing position in some areas. We also expect to add talent in the departments we plan to strengthen and to retain all other employees. In total, we estimate at this time a global net reduction of approximately 900 positions to 1,200 positions, which is about 2.5% of our current workforce. As the company continues to grow and invest in new positions in the future, the improved process from these initiative are expected also to better leverage future productivity. We are launching Leading Beauty Forward from a position of exceptional strength. Since we began our new strategic cycle, our sales have increased by more than 50% and our growth rate has outpaced that of global prestige beauty. Key to this performance is the much more diversified and balanced business we have created with growth engines across our brands, categories, channels and geographies. With insights from our 10-year compass, we anticipated many of the trends influencing the industry's rise. We also modernized our processes and technology infrastructure. Our Strategic Modernization Initiative has been deployed through most of our organization, creating greater visibility to information that let us manage our business in a more cost-efficient manner. We developed a wider spectrum of capabilities, strengthening our talents in areas such as R&D, supply chain, information technology, retail, digital and consumer insights. Leading Beauty Forward is designed to build on these achievements, to further increase our efficiency and effectiveness. Global prestige beauty is thriving. Growing industry with new channels, emerging geographies and the influence of younger consumers. With the convenience of the Internet, the expansion of specialty-multi retailers dedicated to beauty, particularly in the U.S., how consumers shop is changing rapidly and competition has intensified. Lower barrier-to-entry resulted in more than 250 new niche brands launching around the world last year. And the sheer number of beauty products vying for consumers' attention is vastly increasing. The design of our new structure should generate greater productivity through better cost leverage of our sales growth. Importantly, Leading Beauty Forward will recreate ongoing savings and reinvestment to help continue our momentum in this fast-growing and more competitive market, which should mean greater sustainability and less risk in meeting our future growth targets. As the global leader in prestige beauty, we are poised to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead by taking charge and leading change. Leading Beauty Forward further positions our company to continue winning in this rapidly-changing arena, where the ability to anticipate developments and react cheaply and nimbly is more essential than ever. We expect to sustain our strong growth and lead not only our company but all of the prestige beauty forward to greater heights. Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. So, as Fabrizio just discussed, Leading Beauty Forward is a multi-year initiative designed to help us fuel our growth momentum and create a more efficient cost structure to sustain our margin progression beyond fiscal 2018. During the course of the initiative, over the next few years, we expect to take charges of approximately $600 million to $700 million. We expect to begin realizing initial benefits from the program in fiscal 2018, but will continue to maintain our flexibility to invest in opportunities and mitigate risk. At this time, we do not expect this to affect the long-range guidance we provided last summer other than the related restructuring charges. Once fully implemented, we expect to generate annualized net benefits of $200 million to $300 million, currently anticipated to be fully realized after fiscal 2019. We expect to reinvest a portion of those savings behind the capabilities we need, that Fabrizio just discussed, to continue to succeed in the rapidly-changing global prestige beauty environment. We will, as we usually do, update our three-year strategic outlook and share our goals in August. The update will include the impact of this initiative, any adjustments to our strategy since last year, the addition of recently acquired brands and changes in currency rate assumptions. We are pleased with our results so far this year and we believe Leading Beauty Forward will play an important role in supporting our continued sustained growth momentum for the long-term. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, Fabrizio, I had a question on innovation. If you are to characterize the pipeline going back five years, three years, and then today, how would you explain it to us? And I'm really coming at this from a point of it takes time usually for the pipeline to get filled versus the product actually hitting the marketplace. So, I just wanted to get some context on how you feel about the pipeline today versus maybe five years ago. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I feel very strong. I think our pipeline versus five years ago, I would say, is almost doubled in terms of the power of extra business. We have a very clear internal process where we look for sufficiency of our innovation pipeline versus our next three years, five years goals. And I can tell you, we consider our innovation pipeline more than sufficient. Now the characteristic of the pipeline has changed in some way also. First of all, today the pipeline is much richer in makeup because as you heard, the makeup category is in this moment a fast-growing in the world and also very fast changing. So, there is some outstanding innovation pipeline in makeup, and the makeup pipelines tends to be done by many smaller products versus few very big products, which is more typical of the skin care pipeline. So, that's a change and we have adjusted to that change. Our skin care pipeline is strong; but again, within skin care, the pipeline is more focused on what we call instant benefit skin care versus the long-term anti-aging, and that's changed. And third, but probably very, very important, our pipeline in the fragrance business is changed. It is done by much more high-end luxury artisanal fragrances which will allow us, in my opinion, to continue gaining market share in the high-end profitable fragrance business. And finally, in hair care, our pipeline, particularly in the styling, more profitable part of hair care, is stronger than ever. So in that, I feel positive about the sufficiency of the pipeline, and also I feel positive by the fit of our pipeline to the future of the markets as identified by our compass. Operator : Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Obviously, you're seeing very strong growth in makeup, as is the category. Can you discuss how long you think this cycle of makeup category strength can continue as you look out over the next few years? And what's driving the category growth? And then on the e-commerce side, how sustainable do you think the strong growth is that you're seeing on that business? You were kind of earlier than a lot of peers in focusing resources there on that channel. So, I guess, is there any risk going forward that competitors start to catch up with you? Or do you think you're widening your gap versus peers in terms of the way you manage the business? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, on makeup, first of all, I believe this is a long-term trend. The makeup category is growing, driven by several aspects. The first one is that the Asian consumer, the Asian women are becoming more avid users of makeup. And so this is an enormous amount of growth, potentially, that will develop \u2013 it is developing now and will continue to develop in the next years. The second big trend is that the Millennials are, on average, using more makeup than the previous generation, so there is an increase of consumption per individual in all markets, including developed markets. And this is a long-term trend, also because what it is driving, the more usage of makeup, is what historically has been our strength in our business model, which is education and customization. But now the education is available also via online, exactly our e-commerce activities, and via social media, which is booming the amount of how-to videos, different trends, et cetera. So, the combination of this more amount of trends information and how-to information with the Millennial generation point of view, is pushing makeup up. I think this will continue for a long period. In term of our activity in e-commerce, we continue to do very well. I think we gained substantial competitive advantage; but not only in the execution in market, also in the capabilities. We have a very strong e-commerce team that is developing amazing work, which are divided into technology people that can develop sites and develop activity in a very fast pace around the world from our centralized offices in New York, in a very \u2013 with investment that now will pay out for the long-term that we had done in the previous years. And we had great quality of execution in the creative silo (36:15). So, on top of the number of sites, the ability to penetrate the markets, frankly, we have the capability and the quality of execution that for the time being set us aside, in my opinion, from the industry. Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And we also have a very good partnership with all of our retailers around the world to make sure that our products are displayed and presented well on the retailer dotcom sites as well. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. First, Fabrizio, I want to go back \u2013 get into advertising a little bit for this particular quarter. Because coming into the quarter, you probably planned to increase A&P support in the businesses of course to continue driving sales and support some of the product launches. But the sales growth did decelerate a little bit, probably a little bit more than people had expected. So, can you help with some \u2013 provide a little bit more insight in how you go about making decisions on A&P spend? Because that line does continue to move around a fair bit quarter-to-quarter. And then also in terms of the Chinese tourism, do you think you're making up the shortfall in Hong Kong from lack of Chinese tourists in other areas? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, first of all, in terms of the sales for the quarter, we continue to believe that we will deliver the fiscal year in the 7% to 8% range, which means if you look at the numbers that we assume actually an acceleration of the sales trend in the fourth quarter. So, the sales by quarter depend a lot by initiatives, launches, and what happens in specific markets. And the way we take A&P decisions is really, we base the decision off if we believe there is enough rate of return on that investment in that moment. For example, in quarter three, the things that we saw going less strong than we expected was Hong Kong, and so when we add markets that decrease their growth significantly, we do decrease our spending there and we keep the spending for better moments where there is better market traction. So, what you're seeing in the third quarter, very specifically, is reduced spending in Hong Kong from our side. The second area where we saw less traction was U.S. mid-tier department store brick-and-mortar where we clearly saw less structure, together with all the tourist doors in the U.S. that particularly influenced by the absence of Brazilians and Russians that was a very dramatic change. So, when we see these dramatic change, we obviously adjust our investment. The second reason was, in this case very specific is some product launch initiatives on Lauder and Clinique that we decided to move in supporting them in the fourth quarter which is the other reason why we are moving the investment from one quarter into another. Personally, I see this as a strength. We have the agility to move our A&P investment by quarter depending on the market situation and the product launch situation, and this make us more efficient and more effective. And we stay consistent on our year ago that we will commit to do our best to deliver, that's not changed. But by quarter actually we see agility and flexibility as strengths. On the Chinese consumers, now we are definitely doing much better with Chinese consumer in other areas where they are going. For example, in Europe, as we have seen, there is a growth of our European business which is partially driven by tourists and the tourists are also Chinese. We have seen Korea coming back and Japan being pretty strong. So yes, we recovered some of the sales. However, not all of them. We have a very high market share in Hong Kong. Very, very high market share. And our market share, for example, in Japan is half of the market share we have in Hong Kong. So in that situation, we obviously cannot recover the Hong Kong losses completely in other areas. And that's what you're seeing in this moment as a phenomenon. But it's a temporary phenomenon and as soon as Hong Kong will stabilize in other markets where we are now building market share like Korea, we'll achieve the levels we believe are achievable, that things will accelerate again. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you just talk about some of the U.S. NPD trends? Because it's not just Est\u00e9e Lauder, but the bigger brands like still continue to lose market share from some of the smaller niche brands. So, is there a strategy in place to find a way to kind of outflank them? And then maybe most \u2013 I don't want to say problematic, but it seems like M\u2022A\u2022C is declining quite a bit in the U.S. \u2013 I shouldn't say quite a bit, but it's declining. So, can you just talk about the M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. versus international split and if the international growth can offset some of the softness in the U.S.? Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, starting for M\u2022A\u2022C, M\u2022A\u2022C is really doing very, very well internationally. M\u2022A\u2022C is growing strong double-digits in every single market of the world and is \u2013 the temporary flattening of the retail trend in the U.S. is being more than offset by a booming international business. The temporary flattening of the U.S. trend is driven by two aspects. One, as I said, is the fact that the lower traffic in mid-tier department store is one of the driver. And the other is tourists. I mean, M\u2022A\u2022C business is driven by tourists of the world that visit the U.S. in a significant way, because the brand is very, very popular around the world. So, the important decrease of tourists, particularly Brazilians and Russian, as I said, have temporarily limited the retail of M\u2022A\u2022C also because these stores were very strong in the base period that we are comparing this to. But overall, in total, M\u2022A\u2022C continues to be absolutely one of the strong drivers of our success around the world, and we have programs to ensure that this will continue. In terms of the success of the small-size brands in the U.S., this is a fact that as I explained in my prepared remark, that the combination of easier access to consumers and more availability of investment \u2013 money at a lower interest rates, have created a lot of new launches of brands. And the possibility of social media to bring these brands' attention to consumers is taken down the barriers-to-entry. So, the way we are reacting is first of all, reinforcing the business in our strong brands. Second, participating to this with our mid-size smaller brands, including acquisitions. Smashbox was one of these brands when we acquired these brands and now, in fact, it's growing at double-digits in the context of this. And then finally, it's the diversification of our distribution. We have freestanding store, more specialty, continued success of online, and our support to mid-tier department store to accelerate, to re-enforce that business model to be able to better attract Millennials and better activate the floor in order to become even more competitive as to this development of smaller brands and of new channels. This is one of the changes that I was describing before that requires adjustment in capabilities and investments in supporting our brands growth. Operator : Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. If we take a look at your margin performance over the past couple of years, it seems to have moderated a little bit here in terms of the year-over-year increases, and I realize there's FX as well as the acquisition impact in that. But, it really seems to have slowed, particularly since the end of the 2010 to 2013 restructuring program. And so, I guess as we look at your new restructuring program, is that a sign, maybe, that the incremental margins on organic revenue growth is lower than what it was? And I guess if that's the case, there's been a discussion and you guys have talked about the costs of growth not having gone higher, but the math would seem to indicate that again, maybe that incremental margin isn't as high as it had been historically. Any thoughts on that? Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, first of all, I'll let Tracey give more answer. But, first of all to say that this fiscal year we have 50 points, the half a margin point, just affected by currency. And 30 basis points just by acquisitions. So, 80 are affected by currency and acquisitions. So yes, that's a new fact in the margin evolution. But then the combination of our business and cost savings is actually producing the power to continue growing margin. Obviously, if currency and acquisition will stop affecting it negatively, this would be more visible. The other thing is there is also a mix change in our business. So, we have more freestanding stores and we have more makeup versus skin care that also are changing the impact of mix in our business. So, we need to continue to deliver our growth, we need to become more efficient and effective and manage our overall cost structure better. That's part of what we are announcing today and we are going to do. Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, I think those are the two differentiators, John, in terms of the timeframe that you referred to. Both the restructuring program previously, which allowed us to reinvest back into the business and really drive and support what was a skin care moment, particularly in Asia, and the period post that corresponded with a slowdown in Asia and Asian consumption, particularly in China and Hong Kong, as Fabrizio spoke about, which certainly slowed our skin care business, particularly with our large brands like Est\u00e9e Lauder and to a lesser extent Clinique. So, that is a margin difference in terms of our business performance relative to the previous timeframe. One of the things that the Leading Beauty Forward program does for us, because we are and certainly our ten-year compass has allowed us to continue to understand that there are very, very significant growth opportunities for us from a total company standpoint \u2013 it allows us the freedom to invest more in those opportunities, irrespective of the margin and deliver our margin goals well into the future. So, it's a very exciting program. But certainly it is proactive on our part, looking forward in terms of where the growth opportunities are and making sure that we can support them with capabilities, we can support them with other investments and still drive the business and the profit expectations. Operator : Our next question is from Lauren Wolff from Piper Jaffray. Lauren Wolff, your line is open. Lauren M. Wolff - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Apologizes. Thanks for taking our questions. We have a couple for you this morning. And I'm calling on behalf of Steph Wissink. The first question we have I guess we have seen an ad spend shift into Q4 related to Est\u00e9e and Clinique. Is that tied to specific product line introductions or in response to other channel plans? And then secondarily, just examples of speed and agility, is that largely in the product development and marketing pipeline? Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, I think on the A&P, Fabrizio did speak with that \u2013 speak to that a bit earlier, Lauren. It is tied somewhat to some of the launches that we are expecting from particularly Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique in the fourth quarter. It's also tied a bit to some stores that slipped in terms of store openings from Q3 into Q4, primarily related to M\u2022A\u2022C; so those are the primary drivers. And as Fabrizio mentioned also previously, the slowdown in Hong Kong and a couple of other markets slowdown, North America, we've seen the last few years post-holiday traffic has been quite slow and it has taken longer to start to see traffic flow back into particularly the department store channel and particularly the mid-tier department store channel. So, those factors are what caused us to think that the A&P spend that we had initially planned for Q3 would be better spent in Q4. Operator : Our next question is from Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hello, everyone. My question has to do with your expansion of freestanding stores in the third quarter. My understanding is that you had opened 90 out of the 250 target that you set up for the year by the second quarter. 90 by the second quarter. So, if you can tell us how many stores you opened in the third quarter, in what regions, what was the contribution to growth, and whether \u2013 what is slotted for Q4 is what it's going to drive the re-acceleration of the top line growth? Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Javier, we opened net 25 stores in the third quarter, a little bit less than what we had expected, and as I just mentioned, more of those will shift to the fourth quarter. We don't comment on the incremental sales by channel related to growth from our different channel activity outside of travel retail and online. But certainly the incremental stores will contribute some to the growth in the fourth quarter. A pickup in performance in the U.S. is also expected to drive more of the fourth quarter growth as well and in particular our bigger brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, in addition to M\u2022A\u2022C. Operator : Our next question is from Caroline Levy from CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Well, thanks so much. Good morning. Two questions I have to ask on China, of course. If you could talk a little bit about the shift in channels. And obviously, online is doing really well, but could you talk about your strategy within department stores? How many freestanding stores you're opening beyond the Tier 1 cities and whether over time, you think freestanding stores will be throughout the country or online? How big could online get there? My second question is simply on innovation in skin. I'm just wondering, if you're changing the way you look at that innovation, given the challenges to the growth in the category now? Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So on China, we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China is good, is strong, and the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit, with the exception of our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, which is the biggest brand in that profile. So, first of all, even before distribution we are diversifying our brand portfolio that goes with the distribution, because different brands are in different distribution. And we are diversifying geographically, because as I explained, our timing was through also this quarter, we are opening new cities and new geographical area of China. We opened one new city, we opened 13 new doors just in the quarter three. In term of the channels, online is doing well and will continue to do well. Today, we have now 10% of our business by now in online in China, versus 12% in the U.S. So, China is catching up with the U.S. at the speed of light. We are opening more freestanding store. In this moment, it's mainly on M\u2022A\u2022C and Jo Malone. But in the future, we may decide as we see the opportunity to have also other brands, increasing the number of freestanding stores, particularly in the cities where this is appropriate and there are no alternative distribution solutions. I personally believe that the future of freestanding store in China will go directly to omni-channel, meaning the stores will be connected to the online brand dotcom activities and will be one basically omni-channel opportunity that will bring the brands in many more cities with pretty efficient freestanding store models which are not the traditional big freestanding stores in cities like in the developed markets. And finally, we believe the specialty channel over time will also develop in China. And today, we are much more penetrated and developed in the specialty channel in China that we were in the U.S. at the beginning of the specialty channel development. So, well diversified by region of China, well diversified by brand or better diversified by brand in our strategy and well diversified by channel is our goal for the development of the China markets. Now in the innovation on skin care, as I explained before, yes, we are looking at skin care in a different way, reflecting the new consumer trends and reality. As I said, when you take skin care as a whole, there is a bigger and faster growth in what I call skin care for immediate benefit or skin care as a base of makeup. And there is less growth in this moment in the intense anti-aging skin care part. For the same reason of makeup, a lot of the growth is driven by Millennials, which are more interested in this part of the skin care. So yes, big part of our innovation pipeline is also driven in the skin care benefits, which are more modern and more Millennial. Take an example, the New Dimension launch of Est\u00e9e Lauder is not about anti-aging, it's about really the shaping of the face, depending how consumer want. Or think of our fastest-growing skin care segment, which are masks. Masks \u2013 or even we have a brand GLAMGLOW, which is completely focused on masks, and masks is a product you use to get immediately after ten minutes, the benefit that you're looking for, be it luminosity, moisturization, irritation or brightening, et cetera. So skin care for immediate benefit, which is closer to makeup in reality, in term of benefit for the consumer, is the fastest growing trend. And our pipeline in these areas are the strongest they ever been. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thank you. Good morning. First question on Hong Kong. Fabrizio, you mentioned earlier that you think that's going to be a temporary phenomenon, but it's been going on now for five or six quarters. Is there anything that you're seeing that leads you to believe that that should get better anytime soon or is that going to be with us well into fiscal 2017? And then shifting gears to skin care a little bit. You just mentioned the new reality in that category. Is there anything that could be done to re-accelerate the category? Or is that going to be demographically challenged for some time? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, okay. On Hong Kong, so I don't know what I don't know. I'm saying it's temporary because Hong Kong is a gray market with an enormous internal demand of local consumers. And it's a very attractive market for Chinese, in general. So, it has been declining substantially in the last period. I believe at a certain moment it will stabilize. I personally don't have the expectation that we'll go back to big growth fast, but I do have the expectation that this trend will stabilize. And it will stabilize also because the local consumption is actually continuing to increase, and so is the mix between local consumption and tourist, particularly Chinese tourists, that at a certain moment will stabilize. And I just came from Hong Kong. As I said in my prepared remarks, I was in Asia last week, I visited Hong Kong and Korea, and the other thing that gave me confidence is the strength of our team there, which is managing this very difficult time in its fantastic way, increasing their activities on local consumers to help our business to stabilize without waiting for tourists, but just increasing our market share with locals, which I think is the right strategy, and I have great confidence in our team to be able to stabilize the trend as soon as the market will allow. On your skin care question is \u2013 I think I've answered already several times \u2013 the skin care, obviously, is and remains the most important categories overall and will continue to grow. As I said, the fastest growing part of skin care is the skin care which is more relating to immediate benefits, which is the skin care, which is of higher interest for Millennial. We had to adjust our innovation, our technology, our activities and planning for the future to the balance between more drastic anti-aging benefits and more immediate benefits. We are doing that via our portfolio brands. Some of our brands are much stronger in anti-aging, like Est\u00e9e Lauder. Some other of our brands like GLAMGLOW are completely focused on immediate results skin care. And some of our brands like Bobbi Brown have a strong skin care business, which is actually that skin care is a base of makeup. It is to support the makeup habits of women. So, we are attacking skin care on multiple fronts : anti-aging; base of makeup; instant benefit, thanks to our portfolio brands and thanks to our innovation pipeline. I feel very strong about our long-term skin care trend, but it's a fact that makeup in this moment is a much faster growing category. And we are, again, I see as a strength that we have the agility to adjust and refocus our investment resources depending on the biggest trends we see. Operator : Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I just had one clarifying question on the door openings and second on the investment spending. So first on the doors, just I wanted to confirm that 250 doors is still the right number for this year. So there would be 135 doors opening roughly in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, if that's the case, that would actually suggest that a lot of the step-up in spending budgeted for this year is really affiliated with those doors more so than necessarily a specific step-up in advertising. So, if you'd comment on that, it's great. And within the AMS line, I know it's not reported quarterly, but on a full-year basis, if you could talk about how that mix has maybe shifted over time. If there is some reduction in some buckets, like sampling or merchandising, with less reliance on department stores, but an increase in the kind of core advertising dollars, that would be really helpful. Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Lauren, I'll start, and then I'll let Fabrizio add. In terms of the door openings, you're right, approximately 130 doors in the fourth quarter, possibly a little bit less. And yes, we do see and expect to see a step-up in our store-related expenses, so selling expenses, store ops expenses related to many of those store openings. We also do, though, however, expect to see a step-up in A&P expense related to some of the programs that we are supporting in the fourth quarter, and it runs the gamut in terms of the spend. Certainly there is some sampling that's involved in that A&P spend, so we did talk about the fact that promotion was down in the third quarter. We do expect it to be up more in the fourth quarter related to some of the programs that we're supporting. Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And in terms of advertising, I mean, we are \u2013 there is an increase of sampling, to be very clear. Sampling more and more important, given the dynamic of the consumer and given also the channels that we are going in. There is an increase in loyalty programs and the ability to link consumers to loyalty activities, particularly that goes along with freestanding store and online and e-commerce. There is an increase of this and a decrease of all other kind of promotion, which are more typical of brick-and-mortar. And in terms of swing, I would say you need to look at what's happening for us is like our magazine print advertising is more or less stabilizing; but our TV advertising is decreasing and is increasing of equivalent or more the digital social media advertising. So summarizing, it's a stabilization of the magazine advertising, a decrease of the television and an increase of the digital social media. That's the trends we see now. Obviously, this mix is very different by country in the world and by brand. But in general, this is the big trend we're seeing. So more sampling and more digital social media. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join for the entire call, a play back will be available at 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today through May 17. To hear a recording of the call, please dial 855-859-2056, passcode number 91609680. That concludes today's Est\u00e9e Lauder conference call.

Riley & Co. Joe Altobello - Raymond James Steve Powers - UBS Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcasted. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, and the discussion of our financial results and expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find the reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our company had a very successful year in fiscal 2016. We delivered excellent financial results with adjusted constant currency net sales growth exceeding 7%, faster than global prestige beauty growth and adjusted earnings per share rose 13%. We also made progress on our strategic objectives, by farther diversifying our business, strengthening our multiple engines of growth and advancing our creativity and innovation. This year new products represent nearly one quarter of our sales, an all time high. Additionally, we designed and launched Leading Beauty Forward, a multi-year initiative to increase our efficiency, speed to market and agility. Our strong performance confirmed our resiliency during a volatile fiscal period that began with MERS in Korea and ended with Brexit in the U.K. In between we experienced sharp currency fluctuations, disruptive geopolitical events including increased terrorism and slowing economies in some of our key markets. In global prestige beauty, we also faced tougher competition and change in consumer behavior. Nonetheless, we successfully navigated these new challenges by also strengthening the company's fundamentals, making us confident, we can sustain our strong and profitable growth and achieve our long-term goals. Our best growth came from our makeup category especially MAC, our luxury brands, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and the online and specialty multi-channels. Our ability to grow so strongly in such a dynamic landscape is a testament to our more balanced and better diversified business, and strategic ability to identify and anticipate change in consumers and industry trends. That is what defines and distinguish our company. In other of our key attributes is our increasing agility. During the year, we saw a variety of markets impacted by unexpected economic, political and social events. During those times, we made sure our resources were aligned with other areas, having better growth potentials and other key strength is our multiple engines of growth throughout our more than 25 brands based on categories, channels and countries. These allowed us to achieve double-digit growth in some brands, channels or markets, while balancing lower growth in other areas. For example continued political unrest in Hong Kong caused a sharp drop in Chinese tourists, who travelled to other countries instead. Our brands quickly responded by increased the range of products appealing to Chinese consumers in key tourist doors in the market they visited across Asia and Europe. Fiscal year 2016 was also marked by rapid changes in global prestige beauty. Thanks to our 10-year compass, we had anticipated many of the trends and we're well positioned to meet consumer change in desires and shopping habits. For instance, we've increasingly invested in digital marketing and e-commerce, which was our fastest growing channel this past year. Our global E&M commerce sales surpassed $1 billion for the first time, a milestone we are very proud of and we expect our strong online growth to continue. We made progress on our strategy as we strengthened many of our brands that diversified our portfolio. Our compass pointed to the growing interest among Millennials for more specialized brands. So we nurtured the ones in our portfolio into significant competitors. Several of them including Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Smashbox, MAC, La Mer powered much of our growth and gained share. As makeup sales soared across the industry, Smashbox and MAC grew shapely, driven by their creativity and strong consumer demand. Our specialized luxury brands were big winners and we acquired By Kilian, which strengthens our spending in the fastest growing area on fragrance the ultra prestige tier. Additionally, we have made minority investments in a successful Korea skincare brand Dr. Jart, which give an interest in a local brand in that very influential market. Our two big multi-category brands stabilized overall as they each ended the year with flat sales. However, both brands restarted solid growth in makeup. Est\u00e9e Lauder makeup sales rose in every region, led by foundations and lip products, its long standing Double Wear foundation continued to be a best seller worldwide. In skincare, its innovative Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask helped accelerate sales of the ANR franchise in China and generated buzz and photos on social media. The brand's global net sales reflected strong growth in the European region and energy market, offset by decline in Asia Pacific, largely due to Hong Kong. Clinique also advanced on many fronts. Its makeup sales were up sharply on a global basis and Pep-Start Eye Cream was a top seller in several markets. Clinique created digital campaigns featuring Millennial influencers that contributed to solid sales growth in the specialty-multi channel and in Europe. These gains were offset by declining in U.S. mid-tier department stores and Hong Kong. Looking at our business geographically, sales in energy market rose 15% overall and 25% excluding China. To fuel our momentum, we further emphasized our local relevance in products and social media. These past year our brand reached many new consumers in energy markets; Jo Malone entered Brazil for example. We launched our first e-commerce operations in Mexico and La Mer had a terrific growth in Russia. Our channel strengths reflected industry trends and we invested in areas with the best traffic in growth. Sales in our online business rose 27% reflecting solid gains in brands and retailer sites. We opened more sites for our brands and with retailers globally to widen our product availability. Orders and conversion grew more than 20%. We continue to selectively expand our brands in specialty-multi retailers globally to broaden our consumer base. For example, in North America, Estee Lauder introduced the Millennial oriented Est\u00e9e Edit collection in Sephora, while Origins launched in select Sephora stores inside JCPenney and plans to roll out to full distribution there this year. In Europe, Smashbox continued to broaden its prices in Boots in the U.K. and entered the specialty multi-retailer Lot Gardenia beauty in Italy. We strengthened our capabilities, particularly in R&D, information technology, digital and consumer insights. Across our brands creativity and innovation remained a priority. Approximately 24% of our sales came from new products and our investment in research and development climbed in line with our sales growth. Our global patent portfolio has increased 40% in the last four years, primarily in skin care and strategic areas with high consumer interest. Our newest patents covers technologies that will anchor high quality products that we expect to a broad appeal in the light global consumers. We also launched Leading Beauty Forward to reduce costs and free app resource to invest in the areas that will help fuel our growth, including retail, innovation, digital, social media and new consumer phasing activities. In this fast paced environment, we want to improve our speed and flexibility as we go-to-market and serve global consumers and creative contemporaries ways. In this new fiscal year, our actions fall into two broad areas. The first is increasing the reach of our target consumers throughout wide space opportunities across geographies and channels. The second, is enhancing our consumer engagement, with new experiences and innovative high quality products and services, which will encompass digital marketing, disruptive in-store merchandising, compelling creativity and Omni-channel offering. Our brands had numerous opportunities to attract new consumers in every region. M\u2022A\u2022C is one of our largest brand, but isn\u2019t as widely distributed as other brands. It has approximately one tenths the doors of Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and about half the distribution of several direct global competitors. So there are millions of untapped new consumers, the brand can potentially reach. Many of our small and medium sized brands are now poised for global expansion. For example, in travel retail, Jo Malone today is available is less than half of Tier 1 airports. So there is a lot of runway left to reach additional travelling consumers. Online, Jo Malone has e-commerce website in just eight countries, compared to 26 for Clinique. In fact Jo Malone expect to launch E&M commerce in approximately 10 new markets this year. As our consumer coverage increases, we are carefully watching same-store sales growth as well. We expect new points of distribution, same-store growth and pricing to each contribute approximately the same amount to our total sale growth this year. Freestanding stores are expected to account about one third of our new distribution this year. As our brands broaden their reach, they will emphasize fast growing image building channels. In the online world, our focus is on mobile and omni-channel. Consumer expect a seamless integrated experience across channels, platforms and social media. We are implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointments, omni-channel loyalty programs and high touch mobile services. With sales in specialty multi retailers on a fast track, we will increase the number of doors, we are in and widen the scope of our brands in the channel to reach the consumer who shop there. For example Clinique plans to roll out more ULTA locations and enter some Sephora store inside JCPenney. Estee Lauder meanwhile will reach new shoppers with a curated selection of products in ULTA, in 30 stores and on ULTA\u2019s website. In travel retail global passenger traffic is forecasted to grow mid single digit. We expect our net sales to surpass traffic growth, led by many of our midsized brands that have opportunities to enter additional airports all over the world. We are working closely with department stores to bring more traffic to beauty, both in store an online. We will elevate the consumer experience in department stores with differentiated customized services such as makeup lessons from our expert advisors for which there is a strong demand. Although department store had been challenged in the U.S., they continue growing internationally including the U.K., Western Europe, Australia, Canada or Latin America. Social media is integral to every beauty brand today and an important component in winning with Millennials. To engage consumers, our brands plan to utilize more global and local influences, beauty consultants and makeup artists to amplify their messages, Est\u00e9e Lauder is collaborating on a makeup collection with fashion designers and influences Victoria Beckham and she is promoting it to her 12 million Instagram followers. Our brands are increasing their media spending and devoting more resources to digital, which allows them to target their communications to potential new consumers with relevant messages, thanks to better data and new technologies. Approximately 30% of our total advertising spending is now digital, up 15% from last year. Our brands are doing interesting activities in the digital space. Est\u00e9e Lauder launched the interactive global content network based in New York. It was like a news room and Bobbi Brown held its first live video on Facebook, celebrating its 25th anniversary and a new campaign, which attracts nearly one million viewers. Innovation remains paramount, as our brands pursue high growth sub categories. One area is skin care with instant benefit such as masks from some of our brands that make skin glow. In addition Clinique's Pep-Start HydroBlur moisturizer irritates and blurs skinning perfections on the spot and Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme Plus Wake Up Balm creates instant morning radiance. We plan to accelerate our growth in skin care. The recent launch of Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair ampoules should help drive the brand's important franchise. Clinique created a collection around Pep-Start, with the additional moisturizer cleansers and La Mer is rolling out a new formula of its core moisturizing line. With new innovations and consumer engagement activities, we believe we can further strengthen our leading position in makeup. Estee Lauder is building on its Double Wear foundation with an innovative cushion stick. Clinique introduced Super Balanced Silk Makeup, an entry price foundation with sun protection and M\u2022A\u2022C instant curl lash mascara as a customizable brush. We also plan to propel our fragrance business, particularly in the ultra prestige tier where we have a large desirable portfolio. Jo Malone highly anticipated major fall launch is Basil & Neroli and Tom Ford newest entry in its senior collection is Orchid Soleil. Prestige beauty is a driving consumer area and its growth continues to exceed mass beauty in key countries. Underlining demographic trends are positive. The mid-class in energy markets, Millennials and Ageless Consumers had a big appetite for prestige beauty and those populations are increasing. We operate in an unpredictable global environment and carefully monitor ongoing issues such as the ramification of Brexit on our business. We are aware that unforeseen challenges will arise. However, we have comfort in knowing that we have many strengths that underpin our financial performance. Our diversified business is anchored by multiple engines of growth, a wealth of creativity and the ability to quickly react and adapt to events and trends, making us optimistic about our long-term success. Over the next three years, we expect to generate sales growth of 6% to 8% and double-digit EPS increases in constant currency. This year we expect to once again outplace global prestige beauty growth and gain share despite external headwinds and challenges. In fiscal 2017, we forecast constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% with double-digit EPS growth. I want to thank my executive team and every one of our employees for their hard work and passion. They are one of the key reasons we have performed so well and continue to be so confident about our future. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio and good morning, everyone. First I will review our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year financial results and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2017 first quarter and full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. Additionally, the fiscal 2016 full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our strategic modernization initiative. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.65 billion, up 7% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 50 basis points of this growth. Our business was quite strong in Europe, the Middle East and Africa despite macro events in France, Germany and Turkey as well as the U.K. Brexit vote. Net sales rose 12% in constant currency with double-digit growth in most countries notably the U.K., Germany and most of the region's emerging markets. Our sales declined in France due to a large drop in tourism and in the Middle East because of continued economic uncertainty. Our global travel retail channel delivered an 11% net sales increase, reflecting strong retail trends in many tourist destinations, partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong and in Brazil. Currency volatility and terrorist activity continue to effect travel and consumption patterns and we saw a moderation in passenger traffic to Europe in the quarter. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. Australia was a stand-out growing strong double-digits while China, Korea and Japan grew mid to high single digits. Our net sales in Hong Kong continue to decline, but less than in the previous quarter. Net sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency. Latin America grew more than 20% led by Mexico and Brazil and Canada rose mid-single digits. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits. Our sales through both online and specialty multi-channels continue to rise double digits. However declines in tourist-driven retail doors and contained weakness in the Brick and Mortar business of mid-tier department stores curtailed growth. Make-up sales again led product category growth, rising 12% in constant currency. M\u2022A\u2022C, Smashbox, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford achieved double-digit make-up growth and Est\u00e9e Lauder rose mid-single digits. Foundation, lip products, kits and palettes have been very popular among all consumers. Hair care sales increased 5% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from the launch of Invati for men products and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in Germany and in France. Skin care sales grew 3% in constant currency, led by growth from La Mer and Origins. These increases were partially offset by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, reflecting continued weakness in U.S. mid tier department stores as well as in Hong Kong. Sales of fragrance products rose 2% in constant currency. Jo Malone was the largest contributor to growth as sales rose strong double digits. Our recent acquisitions Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle are growing rapidly and By Kilian provided incremental sales. Our gross margin was unchanged from the prior year. Favorability from pricing, lower obsolescence and supply chain savings were offset by channel mix, currency and new products. Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined 10 basis points. Higher store operating cost associated with our retail store growth was offset by lower selling and shipping cost and cost savings from our SMI program. As a result, operating income rose 7% and operating margin improved 10 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9%. Net earnings increased 7% to $163.1 million, diluted EPS of $0.43 was 9% above the prior year, reflecting higher earnings and a small benefit from a lower share count and lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 11%. Switching to our full year, details of our performance are largely covered in the press release, so I will focus on some of the highlights. With strong net sales up 7%, our gross margin improved 10 basis points. Manufacturing favorability and lower obsolescence were partially offset by product category mix and currency. Our full year operating margin declined 40 basis points to 15.5%. While the decrease included slight dilution from the recent acquisition of By Kilian, the decline was almost entirely driven by 50 basis points from the impact of adverse currency. We continue to benefit from our cost savings and sales growth leverage. We ended fiscal 2016 with an effective income tax rate of 28.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from the prior year. Net interest expense rose to $55.1 million from $45.7 million in the year earlier, reflecting the increase in debt from our May 2016 bond issuances, partially offset by higher investment income. In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately $135 million in restructuring and other charges, $54 million of it related to the transformation and modernization of our global technology infrastructure, which is largely complete and approximately $81 million in charges for our leading Beauty Forward initiative. Operating cash flow was $1.79 billion, representing a slight improvement over the prior year, adjusted for the SMI shift. We invested $525 million in capital projects, two thirds of which was in consumer facing areas such as counters, retail stores and E&M commerce sites. We repurchased 10.5 million shares of our stock for $890 million and paid $423 million in dividends to stock holders, increasing our dividend rate by 25%. In total, we returned approximately 104% of free cash flow to stock holders, contributing to our 6.4% total stock holder return for the fiscal year, which compares with 4% for the S&P 500 for the same period. Additionally, we invested in an acquisition in a minority interest and we increased our balance sheet leverage by issuing $600 million in senior notes at favorable rates. Overall, we're very pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2016. Our 7% net sales growth and 13% EPS growth in constant currency are strongly aligned with our long term goal and we've laid the foundation for more efficient and effective organization to leverage growth with the launch of leading Beauty Forward. Now looking ahead over the next few years, we plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities with an even greater emphasis on speed and agility in the context of a rapidly evolving prestige beauty landscape. The recent Brexit vote has added a layer of uncertainty that will mostly likely not be fully understood for some time and we believe the risk of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year. Nevertheless, our strategies are sound and as a result over the next three years, we expect our business to continue to become even more balanced and diversified by product category, brand, geography and channel. Prestige beauty is expected to grow at 4% to 5% annually for the next few years and we remain committed to our goal of exceeding the growth of global Prestige beauty by at least one percentage point annually. We also expect to continue to drive value from our existing cost saving programs and we expect to begin realizing some of the initial benefits from leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2018 and generate annualized net benefit of $200 million to $300 million upon full implementation of the program. With the recent approvals of the first initiatives under leading Beauty Forward, we can now develop more effective organization structure to enable increasing improvements in consumer engagement for our brands as well as develop more efficient and effective processes for many of our corporate functions, including the initial organization design of a potential shared service report structure. We expect to approve further initiatives throughout the next two years. All of these efforts should permanently reduce the run rate of the areas that addressed under the program and provide funds for continued investment and capabilities that more directly support the sustainability of our profitable topline growth. It is more important than ever that we maintain the financial and operational flexibility to compete effectively in the dynamic prestige beauty industry. We must be able to nimbly allocate the appropriate amount of resources as consumer preferences, travel quarters and exchange rates continually shift. Balancing cost savings, sales leverage and reinvestment for future growth we expect operating margin expansion of approximately 110 to 150 basis points in constant currency through fiscal 2019. We remain committed to our goal of growing EPS double digits in constant currency each year, which we have delivered consistently for the last seven years. Working capital improvement also continues to be a focus and we expect improved cash to cash cycle performance across accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. Over the next three years, we plan to free up over $400 million in additional cash, which would increase our growth and cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings growth. We are targeting inventory days to sell of approximately 150 days by the end of fiscal 2019, a market improvement from today's levels. Now let me focus on our outlook for the fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter. In fiscal 2017, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency. We expect all product categories and regions to grow led by the makeup category and the EMEA region. By channel, growth is expected to continue to be strongest in online, specialty multi, freestanding stores and travel retail. As Fabrizio mentioned, several of our brands will accelerate their expansion in specialty multi retailers and online, which should enable us to reach new consumers as they increasingly shop multiple channels for prestige beauty products. The impact of this activity and the cadence of our new product launches are expected to produce stronger topline growth subsequent to our first quarter. Our estimate reflects current spot rates given the recent volatility we have experienced the last two years. Those spot rates are 112 for the Euro, 131 for the Pound and 101 for the Yen. We continue to achieve cost savings from our SMI program. In fiscal 2017, we expect to generate approximately $150 million in savings primarily from indirect procurement, AMP optimization, supply chain initiatives and selling effectiveness, some of which will be used to invest behind our newly acquired brands and Onmi-channel capabilities. We anticipate our tax rate will range between 28% and 29%, diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. In fiscal 2017, we expect to take restructuring and other charges of $80 million to $100 million with about $35 million to $45 million in the first quarter. We expect to update these estimates when additional initiatives are improved and as a reminder, total program cost beyond fiscal 2017 over multiple years are anticipated to be in the $500 million to $600 million range. In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.8 billion relatively flat with last year with the inclusion of the impact of leading Beauty Forward. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $550 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales. With respect to our capital structure, we have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio and as of June 30 we had approximately 18 million shares remaining on our buyback authorization. We will continue to assess the need for greater leverage to support our strategies including shareholder returns. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales to rise approximately 2% to 3% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately one percentage point. We expect our small to mid-sized brands to continue to be strong contributors in many global markets owing to their increasing appeal with multiple consumer groups across various channels. We also expect continued growth to be generated in many developed and emerging markets, particularly in Europe. Partially offsetting these growth drivers in the quarter are some macro issues that we expect to impact our results. Our U.S. business continues to be affected by low traffic in mid-tier department stores and tourist-driven doors and we are facing a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter, which was our strongest quarter in the U.S. when Estee Lauder and Clinique launched major skincare products and M\u2022A\u2022C had exceptionally strong results. Our cadence of product launches reflects smaller programs for all three in this year's first quarter. The Middle East is projected to decline as distributors adjust inventory levels to reflect sluggish consumer spending and we are experiencing weak sales in France as a threat of terrorism curtails travel and domestic spending in the near term. For the first quarter, our EPS forecast is between $0.73 and $0.77 before restructuring charges. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.03 of EPS. And as a reminder, the size and quarterly cadence of our new product launches and our programs changes from year-to-year. We continue to focus on delivering annual results in our overall long-term sales and profit growth plans. We look forward to another successful year ahead for our company and for our brands. We are fortunate to operate in one of the highest demand consumer categories today. Our brands are among the most desirable in the industry and we believe our team is the most talented in the industry with their incredible creativity, passion for the business and depth of knowledge on what products consumers aspire to have. This winning formula continues to support our confidence and our plan, despite a volatile, political, economic and currency environment. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey good morning folks. Thank you for the question. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning, Jason. Tracey Thomas Travis : Hi Jason. Jason English : Hello. So I guess two questions if I could and both are margin related. It seems like just sort of backing into the implied margin, I apologize to give the detail in some of the prepared remarks, but it looks like you're looking for a flat margin year at the EBIT line this upcoming year. Is that true and if so, what are some of the puts and takes that get you there and then sticking on margins, there was really good progress a couple of years ago and seeing fragrances march higher, we had a setback last year, we've kind of stalled that margins this year with some weakness in the back half of this year, maybe what's going on with the margin progression and the plans to improve profitability on fragrances. Tracey Thomas Travis : So in terms of the overall margin, it's impacted primarily by currency again this year. So this is the third year in a row where we had a fairly significant impact from a margin standpoint on currency and that\u2019s the primary driver. We certainly have some of the mix impact related to makeup and skin care going on as well this year. So some of it is mix impact and some of it is the currency impact. As I indicated, we still do have our cross savings programs to offset a lot of the unfavorability that we are experiencing and we continue to work on other initiatives to improve the margin. On fragrance, one of the things that we've spoken about Jason in the past is, much of our growth is coming from some of our fragrance brands that have higher margin characteristics. So Jo Malone is a very profitable fragrance brand for us. Our newer acquisition because of some of purchase accounting don\u2019t yet have the margin characteristics of Jo Malone, but we certainly expect that they will once we get pass the purchase accounting impact in the next year or two. Jason English : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Piper Jaffray. Steph Wissink : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up question on Leading Beauty Forward, could you just give us some sense of the cadence of the savings and the reinvestment? Should we assume on a quarterly basis that they're pretty well in sync or will there be some timing inconsistencies we should be planning for based on the cost and on the reinvestment? Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis : So, this what we had spoken about as it relates to Leading Beauty Forward, we don\u2019t expect to see any savings from the program until next year. So this year we don\u2019t expect to see savings from the program. As far as the restructuring this year, it could be a bit lumpy in terms of quarter-to-quarter depending on when say projects are approved under the program. And just a reminder in the program we are doing a fair amount of org redesign. So there are a lot of costs upfront in order to realize the savings so that we can actually more permanently reduce cost going forward. So that\u2019s a bit of what\u2019s going on fiscal '17 as it relates to Leading Beauty Forward. We will start to see savings in fiscal '18 or in fiscal '19 and beyond fiscal '19 is when we expect to achieve those run rate savings of net $200 million to $300 million. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA. Caroline Levy : It has to be on China, I was just wondering if you could help understand what you're seeing in Hong Kong and Greater China as whole, because one of the calls we are making is that there\u2019ll just be more Chinese travelling domestically. Do you have the travel retail setup within China that will help you there or do you have to build the traditional stores to capture the Chinese who are not travelling outside as much as there were? And then just within Korea, I think you're already lapping MERS, so just -- I was just wondering if you expect accelerating growth there? I know you're doing much better you're growing, but are you seeing some good trends there? Fabrizio Freda : So Caroline, we love your questions about China. So the answer is yes. I think you are right. First of all, the amount of consumer or Chinese consumer travelling abroad is very solid, as you know is well above 100 million this year, 117 millions is the numbers, we calculate and is growing. So first of all there is no at least in our knowledge any reduction of travelling. Now where they travel, you are absolutely right. Less of them travel to Hong Kong and more of them travel to different destination internationally. That is also true, that there is an enormous increase of travel within China and we are very well positioned. We have -- as you know there are duty-free areas within China where we are very strong. For example Hainan Island that are increasing and there is more travelling there. On top of that, the fact that consumer travel touristically within the country offer us the possibility or continue building distribution in territory and four tier cities, where we are enjoying this internal travel, which obviously in this case is not duty-free. So both are true, continue increase of external travel and increase of internal travel and we are capturing to both opportunities. As far as Korea is concerned, we are doing very well in Korea. We are growing, for the year we\u2019ve been growing more than the market. So we build market share and we continue to see very strong growth also in the Seoul Airport and so the Korea trend in fiscal year '16 has been very, very strong. And we expect the Korea market to continue to have a strong influence on Asia in general and that the Korea consumers continue to be a high demanding consumers that we use also to as a benchmark for the kind of new ideas and new products that we go to launch in Asia or globally. Tracey Thomas Travis : And Caroline, we do see in the first quarter in addition to we are lapping, as I mentioned very strong growth in the quarter last year from the Middle East and France and softer performance this quarter for obvious reasons that we spoke about. We are seeing very strong growth in Korea in the first quarter because we are lapping MERS. Caroline Levy : That\u2019s great. And could you touch on Hong Kong little? Just what you see happening? Fabrizio Freda : Hong Kong, as we said in the prepared remarks is we continue to see decline in Hong Kong. We continue to see reduced flow of tourists, but we see increased purchase, and increased business with local consumers. So Hong Kong continues to lose tourist and continue to have a solid actually increasing business with local consumers. So I believe the market is in a transition and the same for Macau and so we see declines, but declines in lower levels than declines we saw before. Caroline Levy : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks and good morning, everybody. Fabrizio, wanted to ask about your acquisition strategy and your thoughts on whether continuing to purchase small brands makes sense, particularly it seems your larger competitors are making some larger scale deals. And then also could you discuss fragrances? Where you're focused compared to doing makeup, which seems to be a focus of some of your competitors as well as perhaps skin care where you make a play perhaps for the improvement in that category relative to levels in recent years. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. First of all we agree. It\u2019s not about buying small brands. That\u2019s not a strategy. The strategy was to create a portfolio of the high-end artisanal fragrances that combined could change really the market and that make the fragrance market again a market of high-end consumer demand driven brands that can inspire the consumer in the world of fragrance and make so the company, the company with the best portfolio in this growth area of the future. That was the acquisition strategy there. It\u2019s not about small brands or big brands. It was about building the most amazing portfolio of artisanal fragrance brands, and we have done this. So you are also right that there is a growing makeup business around the world. We already have an amazing portfolio than with some of our competitors didn\u2019t have. So we had M\u2022A\u2022C, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox. By the way, Smashbox was the first acquisition that we\u2019ve done. It was exactly makeup, but we agree with you that the future will see opportunities to continue growing in makeup and there will be opportunities for more makeup brands in our portfolio. And in terms of skin care, we purchased GLAMGLOW, which is a skincare brand. And it\u2019s a skin care brand, although small, but it\u2019s a skin care brand in our opinion with great potential to grow to become big and also it\u2019s focused exactly on the new skin care trend. So instant benefits by masks and specialty multichannel dynamics. And finally, we purchased a minority interest is one what is the fastest growing skin care brands in Korea today, which is Dr. Jart, which was exactly the strategy. So I believe that the point is that strategy is not about fragrances or small brands. The strategy is about acquiring brands that fill strategic opportunities in our portfolio and this will continue to be the strategy. Mark Astrachan : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. I just wanted to follow up then. So from a M\u2022A\u2022C or your overall makeup portfolio standpoint, are you seeing any impact from your competitors doing deals like not to name specifics, but obviously, L\u2019Oreal has talked about some of the brands that they are growing quite exponentially? Fabrizio Freda : Our M\u2022A\u2022C brand has been growing double digit very strong globally in fiscal year '16, and we expect M\u2022A\u2022C to continue to grow double digits globally also in fiscal year '17 is a super strong brand. And as a lot of markets where M\u2022A\u2022C is growing 20%, 30%, there are so many more consumers that the brand has now reached, so there is full potential. The competitiveness of the U.S. market in makeup has definitely increased. And in fact, we see the need of increasing the competitiveness in the makeup also activity of M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. But, for example, we saw the same opportunity on those in Clinique a year ago and I just want to repeat that in the last 12 months, loaded Clinique makeup in the U.S. grew double digits showing that when we focus on a specific market and specific area, we can get the results. So yes, but there is an opportunity there and we are very focused on it. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Great, thank you. You guys have obviously done a great job over the years of growing well ahead of the category, and Q1 expectations are for a fairly massive slowdown. So can you talk through -- you\u2019ve already talked through some of the things that will impact Q1, but can you talk about the order of magnitude of things that will get better to get you from the two to three back up to the six to seven like how much is the new distribution like the JCP relationship, ULTA, etcetera versus new store openings and improvement in macro, travel, retail, innovations. So, if you could just kind of talk about order of magnitude of those things and then I\u2019ll have a follow-up. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, sure, I\u2019ll start and then please Tracey are there any perspectives. So the building blocks of fiscal year \u201817 and that's the best way I can address your question. The building block is that the first building block is pricing and as I said, out of the 6%, 7%, about two points will be pricing. A lot of the price increases of the year happened in January, and so already these 2% of pricing is skewed towards more the second part of the year. Then think of the distribution. So the second 2% of increase of the year is greater distribution reaching new consumers around the world. Now many of these new distribution, including the one in specialty that you just mentioned, are going to happen after October. Many of the freestanding stores in Europe that we've had the majority of the freestanding store we\u2019re going to open will happen in that period and many of the new specialty multi doors in the U.S. will happen after October. So that\u2019s the second difference, that second positive which is going to happen more skewed ahead in the fiscal year versus the first quarter. The third big point is as I said before to the previous question, we have a very solid new fragrance portfolio in the high end. Now this fragrance portfolio, as you know tend to have a huge opportunity to grow during holiday periods. And so all the holiday periods, they\u2019re not only Christmas, but also Valentine, Mother Day happen to be after the October and this will be another big extra acceleration element which is later in the fiscal year. Then we have all our innovation programs. As Tracey said in her prepared remarks, our innovation schedule change in the year, we have less blockbuster initiative this year because we believe the consumer and the social media environment, which is developing, need more diffusion of newness versus blockbuster approach. So a lot of the innovation is more skewed as of October. In our portfolio, this is the other building block on the same door that will impact the same door 2%, 3% of progress that we see in the year. Then as I said, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are on an improvement trends and we expect Est\u00e9e Lauder Clinique to continue to improve and M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. is expected to continue to improve in the second part of the year and so all these factors will improve the comp part of the fiscal year. So a lot of good steps that we believe will over the year accelerate. The last thing I want to say of that is that we have proven just the year with fiscal year '16 that we finished, we grew two of the quarters more than 8% and another quarter 5%. So we have proven that we have the capability, the potential to grow at 8% plus in the quarters where all the key elements of our building blocks start acting together. Olivia Tong : Thank you. That's pretty helpful. Two follow-ups, first, can you provide how many doors you opened in the quarter. And then just the incremental distribution that you spoke to obviously it helps grow sales, but how do you assess the risk, the potential risk to the prestige of the brand for Clinique going into more value to your department store. And then just generally how do you view the door expansion potential for Clinique and modern brands beyond some of the specialty multi -- the incremental doors that you\u2019ve talked about I think you said 30 doors for Estee. How much more opportunity -- Estee Lauder brand, how much more opportunities do you see there? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : First of all we see many opportunities around the world on reaching new consumers. So it's not about diversification of distribution. It's really about reaching new consumers, and reaching where the traffic of prestige consumers are. We don't plan to reach consumer. We shall not interest in the prestige. We don't plan to distribute in any area where prestige or luxury is not well presented. And we do not plan to distribute anywhere where this service quality will not beat the level of prestige. So we continue to be completely focused on luxury prestige distribution, that means great environment, the right target consumer and the right service level. However the world is evolving, that word is changing, and there are many new opportunities online, specialty travel retail, freestanding stores and obviously some very promising new activities also in the department store world. And we are focusing on all of them and wherever there is growth of prestige consumer. So that really distracts you. What you see in the specific examples we are sharing are the immediate next steps. These are immediate next steps for the long term strategies. So the answer to your question, there are more and more opportunities over the year to continue reacting in that direction and then, Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes, so Olivia, I want to make sure that we clearly answer the question. When we have quoted door counts in the past, we're really talking about retail stores, in some cases our company operated stores and in some cases our total store count, which includes our third party operated stores as well. So when you asked the question about how many doors we opened in the fourth quarter, we opened 35 of our company-operated retail stores in the fourth quarter. We opened a little over 170 of those stores in the full year. We also open third party stores as well in the year and as Fabrizio indicated, of our total distribution growth that's about third of the growth of that 2% distribution is freestanding stores. So they're becoming a bigger part of our overall base of total sales, but still the largest drivers of our growth are our comp performance and certainly the contribution to innovation. Fabrizio Freda : And Olivia the other number is that the sum of the freestanding store that Tracey just described in fiscal year '16 grew 11% sales. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Hi good morning, everyone. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Bill Schmitz : I'm not understanding the negative mix, because it seems like the most profitable brands and the most profitable regions are the ones that are growing the fastest. So why is there negative mix in the P&L? Tracey Thomas Travis : So it's a couple of things, and we have a lot of mix impact in the P&L. So it can be a bit challenging, but if you just look at our category margins, makeup is a very high category margin for us as is skincare. Skincare is a little bit higher than makeup. So when you see the disproportionate growth of makeup, which is happening in the industry and certainly we're both driving and benefiting from and the slowdown that we've seen in skincare it does have a mix impact. So that is a piece of it. The other pieces that Hong Kong is a quite profitable area of the world for us from a sales perspective, sales and profit perspective in that region. And the double digit declines that we've seen in Hong Kong have also had an impact. So there's a geographic impact of the Middle East would be the same. So there's a geographic impact and then there's a category impact from a mix standpoint that we have experienced. We have and the team has done a tremendous of offsetting that impact with our cost saving programs and other choices that we have made in order to continue to grow double digit EPS growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Yes. Good morning. First one is actually just on the point of double-digit growth and this was the case on last year's fourth-quarter call as well. But, Fabrizio, twice you've mentioned for fiscal '17 an expectation of double-digit local currency earnings growth, but at the same time, twice it has been mentioned that the guidance is 8% to 10% local currency. So I just wanted to clarify which it really is, understanding there are risks on the table and macro fact that it is 8% to 10% versus double digit is two different things. The second thing is around cost savings. So I believe for fiscal '16 you started the year expecting $200 million of SMI-related savings. You lowered that to $175 million for the year I think back in May and then as look into fiscal '17 you're talking about $150 million. So it feels like some of those expected savings aren't achievable for some reason, something's changed because I would've thought maybe it was a delay in timing. But something with SMI it just feels like perhaps the savings are not quite what had been anticipated even 12 months ago. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. Thank you for your question. I\u2019ll answer the first part. 8% to 10% -- as 10% at the top of the range which is double-digit. So our point is that we are committed to do our best to deliver double-digit and as usual if we give you a range, we are committed to do our best to reach the top of the range. But to tell you 8% to 10% in this moment in time at the beginning of the fiscal year where there are so many volatility out there and so many social political situations that we have also explained in our remarks, we are basically acknowledging that there are some risks and so that\u2019s what 8% to 10% means. But does not take anything away from our commitment to do all what we can to deliver the double-digit meaning the 10% and so that's simply the way we see that and then Tracey you want to add. Tracey Thomas Travis : Yes. So on SMI we\u2019re actually pleased with our SMI program and we did set a target of $200 million for -- some programs get off to a bit of a slower start given the volatility that we were managing through in the year. So we ended at $185 million. $150 million and again we're talking about year-over-year cost reduction. At some point as you start to go further and deeper on some of these initiatives, there is going to be less opportunity clearly when we initiated the second phase of our savings program, we went after the biggest opportunities first. And then you start to see that weighing down. Hence the reason why we announced Leading Beauty Forward, which certainly will generate more savings in future years as the SMI savings start to narrow a bit. So I think we are right on track with respect to where we expect to be in terms of SMI savings and we certainly will always strive. We have a very competitive team. So we always strive to exceed what we -- what our targets are. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys. I want to ask a short-term question and a long-term one, going back to some of the questions from earlier. One is still on your 2017 guidance, 6% to 7% constant currency, 8% to 10% on the bottom line. I guess I'm still not convinced that the margins you are projecting are flat because of currencies, and maybe dispel me of that confusion because it looks like it's less than 1% of an impact on your top line for the year. You talk about $0.08 on the EPS line, but that's like 2.5% of EPS so that's a very large multiplier, much bigger than we would've expected. So trying to get a sense of why that's the case. And even that, by the way, doesn't explain the margin structure being flat given all the cost-cutting that you're doing, the good cost-cutting that you doing. So that's question one. The other one is I do want to go back to a question in terms of distribution expansion into Sephora and Sephora in JCPenney, into ULTA with Estee Lauder, which I think we would have said 10 years ago, if ULTA had existed, would have been crazy, Jo Malone pushing more. We have seen a lot of not the same, but analogous issues. Just recently Coach, as an example, said, look, we are pulling back from department stores again, slightly different issue because they were discounting a lot. But we've heard this before from Tommy, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, as Tracy knows very well. And you look at this a lot, guys, so I want to get a sense of how you are looking at it. Appreciate your thoughts on this, because there is a concern that at some point you are going to get rid of the scarcity; at some point you're going to massify the brand, which drives the brand erosion and you kind of lose a little bit of that prestige. So given some of those analogies, can you explain kind of long term how much longer do you have before you start hurting the brand? Thanks on those two, short and long term. Tracey Thomas Travis : Okay, Ali, so let me start with your questions with respect to merger. So currency is another big impact and we gave you the spot rates that we\u2019re using, which again certainly could change during the course of the year. But rather than us predicting how that will change, we\u2019re using current spot rates and that definitely has at least 30 basis point impact on our margin for the year. In addition to that, we did talk about the fact that some of our very high profit margin regions are actually showing either slower growth or declines in the case of Hong Kong as we mentioned. The Middle East just slowed quite a bit. U.K. is a bit softer than what we certainly have experienced over the last couple of years. So those are all impacting. If nothing changed with respect to either our category mix or geographic mix, then you would be absolutely spot on. But those are things that we\u2019re managing as well. So our cost savings programs not only help us to expand the margin, but they have helped and fund some of our investment, but they\u2019ve also helped us because of the programs that we put in place a few years ago and are continuing to deliver on are helping us to offset the negative impact of some of the macro situations that we\u2019re experiencing right now. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. And on distribution, Ali, my point is we vet every single decision starting with a consumer point of view. So we are not distributing our brands anywhere where the consumer doesn\u2019t demand them and the consumer is the target consumer. The distribution decision we are taking are always brand building, meaning there are consumers that are on target, particularly Millennial, that we will not be able to reach without proposing the brand in that areas and that\u2019s what is happening around the world, particularly the Millennial consumer are changing their shopping habits. The brands that do not evolve their shopping habits to reach this consumer will basically actually lose traction with the new luxury consumer rather than risk their image. And so it\u2019s an evolution and it\u2019s driven mainly by the habits of the Millennial consumer, also is very different by category. This is happening very aggressively in makeup, for example, and the way the Millennial consumer in makeup is happening also around the world. And a lot of this is about online and the availability of the brands online. So second thing is not the image of the distribution, but is the -- we call it consumer reach. So the way we look at it, because again that\u2019s your question, we don\u2019t look at it like only the image. We look at it do we reach the right consumers. So it is an analysis starts from target consumer reach. And in fact, that\u2019s what we have used as language in our prepared remark. Coverage, reach, rather than expanded distribution. Then when you look at internal number of doors, that\u2019s actually, there are a lot of closures. There are a lot of stores which are being closed not only in the U.S. around the world. So in terms of a number of stores, this is not necessarily an increase of our ability. So it\u2019s putting the brands where the consumer expect them at a certain moment of their progress. Last thing I want to say is that you mentioned Est\u00e9e Lauder Clinique, which are today within Prestige broadly distributed brands. But keep in mind that all the rest of our portfolio is actually an enormous amount of extra distribution opportunity, meaning our brands have not even started being available to the right level of consumer around the world. So a lot of our distribution expansion is not about Lauder Clinique. It\u2019s about bringing the rest of our portfolio to available to the right target consumer around the world and numerical internal sales and profit. That\u2019s where the biggest opportunity is. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much for the question. I wanted to follow up, maybe from a little different angle, on Ali's question. I want to ask about the channel. How do you manage it internally? How do you break the news to your core channel customers, your department stores, that the exclusive availability of not just Estee Lauder, the prestige brand products, but -- the efforts and alignment of your company have been such a big part of their success historically that at the margin, yes, you are following the consumer, but this necessarily means less emphasis on those channels and maybe less investment in those channels going forward. My question would be how do you manage, how do you compensate people to make that switch internally? How do you have those -- have you ever gotten push back from some of your department store partners that maybe what you are doing is hurting them a little bit at the margin? And maybe going down the road, are there ways to make the business actually more profitable by maybe investing a little bit less with businesses that have been -- retail partners that have been more important to you in the past than they are today? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So, no. As I said, we start from the consumer, from the consumer demand. And so that\u2019s the way we make distribution decision and we make distribution decision in partnership with our retail partner. And they always know these things before and we are very, very honest discussions about what\u2019s needed for the brand. Sometimes a new distribution decision actually help sales for the brand in the total country, including in the retailers where the brands was previously distributed. And by the way our brands very rarely are exclusive to a retailer. They are targeting certain group of consumer, that\u2019s clear. For example, Macy\u2019s, as you know, has announced to close 100 doors. We are collaborating -- we will collaborate with Macy\u2019s to protect the consumption of our brands in these doors transferring to other Macy\u2019s doors consumers. We will do our best to support Macy\u2019s in this plan, which we believe they\u2019re doing the right thing. We will focus a lot to support Macy\u2019s in selling more in the remaining doors that they will focus on as well as we\u2019ll continue to support Macy\u2019s in building the best, we can their online business that we have together. So also our retailers decide to close doors to other things and we collaborate with them in keeping the sales, continue increasing the sales. So it\u2019s not about one or the other. If we focus on the client, on the final customer, we get always the right decision made and there are normally win-win for the brands, for our retail partners and for the consumers. That\u2019s what we are looking. That\u2019s our principle. As far as your question in term of if I understood correctly, in terms of internal, internal I think we just have our normal processes. As I said, we\u2019re starting from consumer understanding. We make the decision and then we discuss those with our partners. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gere from KeyBanc. Jason Gere : Good morning. I guess just one question. I was wondering how you acquire customer data for some of the freestanding stores. I know there's obviously a lot of data you can get from the department stores, but I was just wondering how you can leverage some of that information in terms of really trying to keep the momentum going with freestanding. Especially as a lot of those stores are in some of these malls where you are seeing some I guess weakness in traffic with some of the mid-tier department stores; I was just wondering how you think about that. Tracey Thomas Travis : So actually it\u2019s easier for us to acquire consumer data from our freestanding stores given the fact that we have the point-of-sale equipment than it is in the department stores where we don\u2019t. In some cases, in department stores, you\u2019re right, we do also have some equipment that allows us to capture the consumer. But in all of our stores, our freestanding stores, we do. So it\u2019s actually easier for us to capture it in stores as well as online. We certainly do. Our teams look at that information. Our brands look at that information and understand what trends are selling in freestanding stores and whether or not that mirrors or not what is selling in, in department stores and put plans together accordingly. And those are all areas that we -- as we expand distribution, as consumers continue to shop in multiple points of distribution, we continue to aggregate that information and look at whether or not there are any differential trends that the entire business can benefit from in terms of our strategies and how we allocate resources. Operator : Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. As you think about the growth of new products and the impacts that they are having, how do you see their influence on the gross margin? And over what period of time should new products essentially reach or exceed the corporate average gross margin and does it differ by category? Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis : So Dana, great questions, and I probably should have mentioned this as well when Ali asked his question on margin. Depending on our innovation in a particular year, in some cases, we actually choose to launch some innovation that actually has lower gross margin because that we\u2019ve identified a consumer need in that particular space and believe that, that product will drive incremental sales and will build to be a large franchise, particularly for franchises like Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and particularly in skin care. So we have seen in recent years some new innovation that actually is a bit of lower gross profit margin. Clearly as sales continue to build on products that we launched that are new, you\u2019re amortizing the tooling and you\u2019re getting some more favorability in terms of gross profit margin. But largely they stay relatively close to where they\u2019re at, unless there\u2019s a significant increase in volume, in which case you can get lower cost of goods. But we do manage and our teams when you think about the number of brands that we have and the number of new product launches that we have where we have had to Fabrizio\u2019s earlier comment, steady increase in the amount of innovation, our teams manage that gross margin mix quite tightly in terms of making sure that we in the new innovation, at least over few years is offset by innovation that also was more margin accretive. Fabrizio Freda : And I would just would like to add one point to this point on gross margin. At the end, we are a prestige luxury company and so our main task is to have pricing power. And the moment we do a good job, we can do both, we can give to the consumer the super high quality packaging experience they want and the price for it, so that we protect the right gross margin evolution over time. It\u2019s all about pricing power and the power of our brands to sustain it. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley & Company. Linda Bolton Weiser : Hi. I was curious on the U.S. market, given some of the weakness that you are seeing, if you are making any modifications or if you have any initiatives regarding your selling methods in department stores. I know several years ago you made some changes, like more open sell and things like that. So can you talk about what you're doing to try to help the department stores drive that traffic in beauty? Also, is your investment behind the consultants or the sales force in the stores, is it rising because of the weakness? Do you make more investment there? And then, finally, you mentioned on the Macy's how you're hoping to help them shift consumption to other stores. But in the near term is that impacting some of your weakness early in your fiscal year in terms of just the sell-in to fewer doors in Macy's? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So let me start answering this question. As you probably know, Macy\u2019s has announced their intention to close 100 doors, but they did not give a specific calendar when this will happen. So the answer is no. In the first quarter there is no assumptions of the new closing doors, but Macy\u2019s closed I believe 40 or 50 doors so far. And yes, that is obviously the impact of the first 44, 45 doors that we have closed before in fiscal year '16 in the first quarter. But to your core question for the long-term, we definitely are focused to support our department store partners to improve -- to continue to improve the experience on our brands and in general in the beauty flow of department store. We have many activities in this area, many in the area of improved services, many in the activity of innovation and distortion, many in the area of connecting social media to the activities and activity in the area of sampling. In other words, we are really focused in working together how to increase traffic in store which is in this moment the key opportunity. And then to your second question is what do we see in this market? Yes, we see a lower traffic that what we would like to see in our counters in mid-tier department stores and that\u2019s what you see in our quarter one estimate as well. And we are working hard to support our partners to go back to increase this traffic at every level. Tracey Thomas Travis : At the same time both ourselves and our partners work pretty closely together on making sure that as we see -- at the same time of growing volume in all the strategies that we are jointly working on to grow traffic to the beauty counters in the stores, recognizing the reality that there are more options today for women to buy cosmetics and beauty products in many different channels, where historically was only more singularly in the U.S. market. We are also making sure that as you do in a freestanding retail store looking at staff to sales ratios, which any retailer looks at and make sure that those are appropriate for the amount of traffic you see near-term and then investing back in those resources when sales increase. So that too is important both for our partners as well as ourselves to make sure that we are managing profit accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Hi, thanks, good morning. First question, I wanted to go back to the Lauder and Clinique brands and maybe if you could assess for us some of the progress you guys have made over the past 12 months in turning around those brands. Is the momentum that you are seeing as we exit fiscal '16 what you expected to see 12 months ago, given the spending behind those brands, given the expansion in specialty multi, the launch of Estee Edit, how those contributed to that? And are you connecting with the Millennial to the extent that you had hoped 12 months ago? Then, secondly, on Leading Beauty Forward, Tracey, earlier you mentioned that no benefits in fiscal '17. But is there spending in that program is going to run through the P&L that is not being -- that is not extraordinary and being excluded? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis : So let me start with Leading Beauty Forward, there is a slight amount of spending that\u2019s running through the P&L, but it's not meaningful at this point. Most of the program cost right now are running through restructuring because of the nature of the program which is largely important design oriented. Fabrizio Freda : And on Lauder and Clinique, a year ago in Lauder and Clinique were declining. Now they are flat and so there has been a significant improvement of trend. We said they would have started from turnaround in the makeup area of both brands because was the area that was better fit in the other goal which was to attract more Millennial to the brands and we have done it in the U.S. Lauder and Clinique makeup is growing double-digit, which frankly was declining just a year ago and this is an impressive improvement and also globally both brands are growing their makeup in a very strong way. Now the skincare also did some progress as we explained in the prepared remarks. However, on the skincare, the two key issues which is Hong Kong continues to decline and the mid-tier department store traffic issue that we just discussed in last half an hour, those two have been a drag to accelerate as well the skincare part, which now we will do our best to do in fiscal year '17. So good progress on both brands with an excellent start in makeup and some more work to do in skincare. Last point is to your question. So is that what we had forecasted. Frankly, we have done in line or slightly better than what we expected, but we did not forecast Hong Kong to continue to decline in the way it has declined. We did not anticipate the kind of traffic reduction in mid-tier department store that we have seen in the course of the area. So those two things actually were different than what we anticipated a year ago. Operator : We have time for one more question. Please go ahead, Steve Powers from UBS. Steve Powers : Hey thanks, I'm going to try to test your endurance with three quick ones, if I could. The first one is you mentioned Macy's. Across fiscal '17, does your guidance embed any net inventory destocking at the retail level or not? That's the first question. Second question is if you could just update us, in aggregate, as you think about your own freestanding doors as well as your own online sites, what percentage of sales is the direct-to-consumer business today and how do you expect that to trend over the next three years? And then finally, with respect to makeup versus skincare, not surprisingly 2017 sounds like another makeup-led growth year, both for yourselves and the industry. But as you think about the makeup ahead of skincare trend, how long do you think that lasts? I don't know if you can take some learnings from past cycles or other consumer insights, but just as you think about your three-year outlook, do you expect makeup to run ahead of skincare for the duration or is there a crossover point? Thanks so much. Tracey Thomas Travis : So let me take the first two. As it relates to is there some destocking assumed in our forecast and guidance for this year? Yes, given some of the retail dynamics that are going. It may not be enough, but we do have some clearly in there given what\u2019s happening in the U.S. market in particular. As it relates to direct-to-consumer, which for us would be our freestanding stores and obviously our e-commerce as well as retailer.com sites, it\u2019s about 17% of our total sales is our direct-to-consumer business and then on the makeup and skin care. Fabrizio Freda : Makeup and skin care, I think, first of all that makeup will definitely continue to grow and very, very fast. There are two dynamics which are happening, which we believe are for the long term. The first one is the Asian consumer is using makeup more and more. So the dynamic of skin care versus makeup a global level. The strength of skin care was driven by the fact that the fastest growing demand was coming from Asia and Asia consumer use much more skin care than makeup. I think this will continue. So nothing wrong with the skincare trend, but the makeup trend in Asia has dramatically accelerated because the billion of Asian consumers are using makeup more and more. This is a very strong long-term trend. The second is the millennial generation. The data shows that the average millennial use more makeup in more occasions during the week than their mothers. So the more the millennial generation grows in percentage of the total population, the more makeup usage will continue to accelerate. So those two trends are long term. However, it doesn\u2019t mean the skincare needs to continue being growing less. Actually we see in already the first signs that as soon as the millennial will discover also more of the skin care routine, this can impact the skin care. For example, our new brands like GLAMGLOW, which are more focused on millennials and are more based on instant benefit skin cares, which are more important for millennials have seen amazing growth when they do a good product launch. So I personally believe also skin care will accelerate in the future driven by positive trends. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A section, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for the call. And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dennis, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, sales grew in line with our forecast and earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations, due to more prudent expense management, as we navigated through some of the macro uncertainty in the quarter. Across our business, many brands, countries and channels achieved double-digit sales gains. Our strongest performance were our small and midsize brands, particularly those in the luxury tier, many European markets and the online, specialty multi and travel retail channels. Yet, as we had anticipated, our strong gains were partially offset by challenging market and economic condition in certain countries. In constant currency, our sales rose 2% and adjusted EPS increased 5%. We manage our business with a full year perspective. So even though the first quarter top-line growth is starting off at a slower than usual pace, we are confident in our ability to achieve the solid sales and earnings growth we forecasted for fiscal year 2017. Our first quarter growth was slower primarily due to ongoing challenge in U.S. mid-tier department store caused by lower traffic, the market slowdown in the Middle East and difficult comparison in France and Germany and a continued negative trend in Hong Kong. All these challenges were anticipated, and plans are in place to gradually accelerate our sales growth quarter by quarter and position us to deliver our full fiscal year plan. Despite headwinds, there are expected \u2013 we expect to continue in some areas \u2013 but, sorry \u2013 despite headwinds are expected to continue in some areas, we have plans to further leverage our stronger brands, channels and countries. We have robust holiday programs and a strong innovation pipeline, exciting opportunities to reach new target consumers and geographies, especially with our fast growing brands and compelling programs to better engage shoppers. By being well diversified and having multiple engines of growth, we are able to activate the drivers that we believe will fuel stronger sales. These are expected to include a number of international markets, the makeup and fragrance categories and target distribution opportunities. We are reaffirming our previously stated goal of constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2017. This will come from a combination of factors. Our organic growth is expected to accelerate, mainly in makeup and fragrance, fueled by strong innovation in the second half and supported by greater social media initiatives for improved consumer engagement. We should have easier comparisons in several markets since external events that impacted our results last year will be in our base. Also contributing to growth will be new points of distribution globally for our fast-growing high productivity brands with a higher concentration coming in the second half as well as planned price increases. Additionally, the planned acquisition of BECCA will provide incremental sales. As a result, we are also reaffirming our goal of adjusted constant currency EPS growth of 8% to 10% for the full year. In the past several months, we have continued to make excellent progress on our strategic objectives. We believe that the industry's strong growth in global makeup sales will continue, so we are focusing on building and strengthening our makeup portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved solid makeup growth in several brands. However, the total category was affected by declines in M\u2022A\u2022C in the United States, owing to fewer foreign tourists, particularly in New York City and Florida has lowered traffic in department stores. M\u2022A\u2022C is a powerful and authentic brand that speaks to all ages, races and sexes. And we expect its U.S. business to deliver stronger results through the rest of the year. As of October, M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. sales started to improve, thanks to the launch of its successful Selena makeup collection and the new range of lipstick called Liptensity. The Selena collection was inspired by the late singer and her huge fan base and accounted for the highest online traffic in one day on the brand's site. M\u2022A\u2022C will bring back the Selena collection in January to meet continued demand. It has other exciting collaboration and plans including The Nutcracker themed holiday collection and compelling social media programs that will leverage M\u2022A\u2022C rapidly expansion \u2013 expanding fan base, which now includes 16 million global Facebook fans and 12 million followers on Instagram. The brand also has an active presence on YouTube, Twitter and other popular digital platforms by now. M\u2022A\u2022C's international business grew in line with the global prestige makeup, fueled by double-digit growth in most European and Asian markets. Internationally, we expect M\u2022A\u2022C to grow double digit in the fiscal year and gain share, driven by continued organic growth, stronger innovation program, expansion of social media and new opportunities to reach target consumer that don't yet have access to the brand. Today, M\u2022A\u2022C is sold in a relatively small and select number of doors in each market, and there is an opportunity for us to further build its presence where it is underrepresented, primarily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the EMEA region and in China. M\u2022A\u2022C doors are among the most productive of the entire industry. Smashbox, our pure-play makeup brand generated double digit global growth for the quarter, and we expect to deliver strong double-digit increases for the fiscal year. The brand is focused on winning in the specialty multi and direct-to-consumer channels and recently redesigned its U.S. e-commerce site for greater consumer engagement. Our Tom Ford brand had an outstanding quarter with its makeup business nearly doubling, led by its popular new lipsticks. Makeup is expected to continue to be a major growth driver, and the brand should benefit from upcoming color collection inspired by the designer's runway fashion. Fragrance represents the majority of this luxury brand business and continues to generate strong momentum. La Mer, our luxury skincare brand, just launched its innovative skin color collection, which includes 15 shades of foundation, a growing sub-category, blast powder (8:26) and concealer. These products incorporate the brand's signature, Miracle Broth, and are expected to capitalize on growing demand for product that bridge skin care with makeup. The collection has increased traffic to the La Mer counters and websites, and the brand anticipates it will attract new consumers and provide incremental sales to its core products of moisturizers, eye creams and serums. We are also building on our global leadership in prestige makeup. Two weeks ago, we agreed to acquire BECCA, a prestige makeup brand with a unique positioning that is complementary to our other makeup brands. BECCA's strengths is in foundations and complexion products, which are a high loyalty areas. It has grown rapidly by offering a broad and balanced range of shades that appeal to multicultural consumers, along with a strong presence in fast growing North America specialty multi-retailers. It also is active on social media and attracts a diverse and loyal fan base. We also see great opportunity to strategically expand the brand internationally as well as in travel retail and online, which are key growth areas for the company. Strong gains in fragrance this quarter were again led by our luxury brands which are experiencing rapid global growth. Our newest fragrance brands are experienced and crafted to our authentic point of view, similar to our makeup artist's brands and are resonating strongly with the new consumers. For example, we have continued to build out our seasonal Le Labo brand to reach more of its target consumers by opening select high-growth department store doors and freestanding stores globally. At the same time, the brand has had strong like-door growth, leading to exceptional sales increases. Jo Malone superior growth was reinforced by its travel retail business, which benefits from increasing awareness of the brand in key local markets. Jo Malone is capitalizing on growth opportunities by opening new store formats in the travel retail channel. After many quarters of strong growth, Jo Malone rose three places in the rankings to become the third largest women prestige fragrance brand in the United States in the first quarter. This is especially noteworthy, given the brand's limited distribution in only 250 doors in the entire United States. Jo Malone is the second largest prestige fragrance brand in its home market, the UK and growing double digits. Yet, it has just one-tenth the number of points of sales compared to the market leader. We are anticipating on our high-end fragrances will perform well in the holiday season, with enticing gifts offering and new classic scents. And we expect that momentum to carry into the second half of the fiscal year. In skin care, natural products are growing in popularity and we are well positioned with our Aveda and Origins brands. Aveda's new Tulasara skin care line which creates glowing skin inspired by an ancient healing art of India, led to the brand robust skin care sales growth worldwide, exceeding its expectations. Aveda plans to broaden the franchise in the next few months with masks for the face and eyes centered on the theme of weddings. Origins strengthen its leading position in facial masks and its skin care sales climbed double digits in every region. This includes a new line of face and body masks, infused with tea that provides immediate benefit and feature desired by today consumers. Many of our brands are enhancing their distribution in the fastest growing channels to reach target consumers where they're shopping today. Our brands continue to successfully penetrate the specialty multi-channel globally. In the U.S., Clinique continued its rollout in ULTA. And in September, Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced a greater selection of top-selling skin care and makeup products in 30 ULTA doors and on ulta.com Clinique, Origins and Bumble and bumble added location in several stores inside JCPenney. Our brands are also further penetrating the channels in foreign markets. For example, in Germany, GLAMGLOW successfully partnered with Douglas to target core consumers throughout all of its locations. Likewise, when Smashbox entered Finland this quarter, it reached its target consumer by launching in the specialty retailer KICKS. Our travel retail business was vibrant in the quarter, as our net sales growth far outpaced passionate traffic growth, despite some difficult markets including Hong Kong, Japan and Latin America. Our smaller and midsized brands as well as M\u2022A\u2022C are in high demand in the channel. They all increased double digits at retail with very solid like-door growth as we continued to accelerate their rollout. Geographically, Asia-Pacific was the best performer in travel retail and the makeup, fragrance and hair care categories grew sharply. We expect to continue our strong sales increases in travel retail, fueled in part by passenger traffic growth, which is projected to rise during the next three quarters. Our online sales this quarter were once again very strong. Mobile continues to be the fastest growing area in E&M commerce and trend also reflected in our business. In the quarter, m-commerce represented 41% of our online global sales, up from 37% last year. And sales from mobile devices grew 23%. In the recent period, we opened approximately 100 new sites, mostly with international retailers. Looking at our heritage brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique have remained stable. Importantly, in the quarter both brands grew in makeup globally. They have generated makeup growth for several quarters, and we expect each of them to accelerate their makeup business in the second half of the year. Est\u00e9e Lauder's international makeup sales were vibrant with a particularly strong performance in the UK following the Brexit vote. When a drop in the pound increased in a wave of tourists, the brand sold especially well in department stores favored by foreign visitors, such as Harrods where Est\u00e9e Lauder retail sales grows 20%. Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear Foundation was a strong seller worldwide, fueled by its innovative Cushion Stick applicator. In skin care, Est\u00e9e Lauder had global success with Advanced Night Repair, another powerful growth engine for the brand. Est\u00e9e Lauder continued to see strategic opportunity to accelerate its business this year by fueling these two core pillars with new products and compelling digital assets, as it targets a wider consumer base and increased penetration in higher growth channels. Clinique business in North America increased in makeup and skin care, driven by higher sales in specialty multi retailers, online and in select department stores. Clinique also had solid growth in makeup internationally. With strong results for its new foundation called Superbalanced Silk Makeup. It has started a redesign of some counters and stores in the United States and Hong Kong. And as a result, sales climbed in those locations. Clinique expects to broaden its reach in high-growth channels, particularly in North America, and at the same time work with department store to increase traffic at counters and accelerate its growth. Improving productivity is a focus for our entire organization. Through Leading Beauty Forward, our multiyear initiative, we aim to increase our efficiency and reduce costs to achieve both leverage and for re-investment in growth drivers. Additionally, we will improve our speed to market and agility. We are making good progress. Much of the organizational design work and several projects are underway. In closing, we continue to deploy the strategies to drive our sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Our diversified business is fueled by multiple engines of growth and our financial agility enables us to quickly move resources to take advantage of changing consumer demand and new opportunities. This year, we will further accelerate our stronger growth engines, reinvigorate slower areas and create more resources to invest in opportunities and capabilities as we adapt to the changing dynamics in prestige beauty. As we discussed in our August call, our sales profile this year is weighted to the second half and is rolling out as we had anticipated. We expect that fiscal year 2017 will be another successful year that will advance our financial performance and strengthen our leadership. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 first quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward program. Net sales for the first quarter were $2.87 billion, up 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from By Kilian contributed approximately 20 basis points of this growth. From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy and Spain, as well as most of the region's emerging markets. Sales in Germany and the UK were also solid. Last quarter, we called out two issues that we predicted would put some pressure on our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France declined due to a significant drop in tourism against a tough comparison with an exceptionally strong first quarter of last year. Net sales in the Middle East fell sharply as distributors in the area significantly rebalanced inventory levels to adjust to weaker retail traffic due primarily to the impact of lower oil prices on the overall macro environment. We do see some traveling luxury consumers from the Middle East taking advantage of the weaker pound and buying more in the UK. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 10%. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by Korea, which grew low double digits followed by strong growth in Australia, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan. China grew in line with the overall region. Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%. Net sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency. Latin America grew 15%, led by strong growth in Mexico while Brazil remains challenged. Canada rose low single digits and the U.S. declined mid-single digits. Our sales through both online and specialty multi channels again rose double digits. However, we saw continued declines in the brick and mortar business of mid-tier department stores as well as tourist-driven freestanding stores. Additionally, the U.S. had a tough comparison to the prior year, which included some major new product launches in department stores. Net sales by product category were led by the 10% constant currency growth in fragrance for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher margin, top-tier segment of the category. Jo Malone was once again the largest contributor to our overall fragrance growth. The launch of Basil & Neroli, strong comp door growth and expanded consumer reach drove a strong double-digit increase in sales. By Kilian contributed incremental sales, adding about a point to the fragrance category growth, and Le Labo also grew rapidly. Makeup sales rose 1% in constant currency. Tom Ford delivered exceptional growth, nearly doubling its makeup business this quarter. Smashbox rose double digits, and Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique innovation in makeup also drove the category as previously mentioned. And as Fabrizio discussed earlier; M\u2022A\u2022C continued its strong double-digit trends in most international markets. However, the brand's U.S. business continues to experience lower foot traffic and tourism in its core channels of distribution, constraining overall makeup growth in the quarter. Hair care sales increased 1% in constant currency, primarily due to growth from Bumble and bumble. Skin care sales grew less than 1% in constant currency. Double-digit growth, supported by strong innovation from La Mer, Origins and Aveda was mostly offset by lower sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder, which had a major launch in the prior year period, and from Clinique, reflecting continued softness in Asia and in EMEA. Our gross margin declined 30 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to unfavorable currency and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 10 basis points. Higher store operating costs and selling expenses associated with our retail store growth, along with the accounting for stock compensation expenses, were mostly offset by favorable currency transactions and a gain on the sale of a fixed asset as well as more prudent expense management. As a result, operating income fell 1% and operating margin decreased 30 basis points. Net earnings increased 2% to $314 million, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Diluted EPS rose 3% to $0.84 or 5% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to more prudent expense management. As you are aware, we have seasonally higher working capital requirements in our fiscal first quarter as we build inventory to support the holiday selling period. During the quarter, we used $150 million in net cash flows from operating activities and we invested $85 million in capital projects. We used $222 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares of our stock and paid $111 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share. Now, let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year. This range includes the expected contribution from BECCA as we plan to close the transaction this quarter. On a preliminary basis, we estimated that BECCA could add approximately 30 basis points to sales growth and dilute EPS by $0.02 in fiscal 2007 (sic) [2017] (24:58), which won't affect the range of our forecast. Currency translation is expected to depress sales by less than 1%, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, 1.22 for the pound and 105 for the yen for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. For the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 5% to 6% in constant currency, reflecting new product launches and holiday promotions as well as easier comparisons in the U.S. and France. The Middle East and Hong Kong are expected to continue to weigh on sales growth until the second half. Negative currency translation is estimated at approximately two percentage points. Our most recent acquisitions could add approximately 50 basis points to sales growth for the quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.10 and $1.15 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.05 dilution from currency. The acceleration in EPS growth implied in the second half of the year is directly related to the sales growth trends. We are pleased with the performance we made on our strategic initiatives in the first quarter, and we remain focused on delivering another successful year, despite the volatile political, economic and currency environment. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. The first question is more short-term. In your release, you changed the expected full year top line outperformance versus the category to more than 1% from 2% previously, along with the 4% to 5% beauty category growth. So given that commentary in Q1 came in at the low end of the range, Q2's still expected to be below the full-year FX-neutral sales growth rate. Should we expect the sales growth to be more at the low end of your 6% to 7% range now? Is that reasonable? And then the second question more longer term is last quarter, you announced you were expanding more of your business into ULTA and Sephora. As we look out over the next few years, I was hoping you could discuss conceptually how much further distribution expansion you'd expect to see in non-traditional retailers versus your historical footprint and if bringing more brands into those retailers over time is part of your plans. Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So let me take the first half of that question in terms of the range. It's still pretty early in the year, which is the reason why we give a range for the full year. So at this point, we're not prepared to say that we're going to be at the low end of the range. And certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for us. It's holiday. And obviously, the second half of the year is big for us for all the reasons that we spoke about in our prepared remarks. So at this time, it's still very much within the range. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. And the answer to the fact that we will continue increasing our penetration in win in China, the answer is yes. That's part of our program. There are several winning channels around the world in this moment in the area of luxury and prestige. One is definitely specialty multi, and we will continue increase not only distribution but success and continue to increase brands which are tailored to this channel in the future around the world. We will also continue to increase our penetration of the online channels. And we will continue to increase also our penetration of travel retail and distribution in these areas, among others. Operator : Your next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Just following up on Dara's question, if you're not taking the high end off the table, then what are you seeing to make you confident that the second half can accelerate to essentially a double-digit pace in the second half in order to get to the high end of your outlook? But really what I wanted to ask more about was M\u2022A\u2022C because \u2013 what are you doing to remedy some of the things that are going on in the U.S.? I guess part of this is an appeal to tourists and less travel and the impact of that. But how much of this is just how much more competitive the makeup category has become, particularly with the younger consumers that M\u2022A\u2022C has captured for so long? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: All right. So, Olivia, thanks for your questions. Let me start off with the expectations again for the second half. We talked a bit about the innovation that we're expecting in the second half. We talked about pricing, and we also talked about an acceleration of consumer coverage for many of our smaller brands. As you're aware, we most recently acquired a number of smaller brands that are in expansion mode, brands like Jo Malone and Tom Ford and others have quite a bit of expansion opportunity as well ahead of them. And so they are certainly much of that distribution growth is planned for the second half of the year. If you were to think about the second half in terms of the building blocks that we typically talk to you about for the full year, 2% is roughly \u2013 a little over 2% is roughly the pricing expectation that we expect to get in the second half of the year. New distribution would be about 3% to 4%, so a bit of a step-up versus the first half of the year. And then our existing and new business including our newer acquisitions are another 3% to 4%. So that's how we get to the numbers for the full year that we guided to in terms of 6% to 7%. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. And as far as M\u2022A\u2022C is concerned, is first of all, I said in my prepared remarks, M\u2022A\u2022C is still growing double digit in many of the global markets where there is equally new \u2013 equally tough in new competition than there is in the U.S. And M\u2022A\u2022C internationally has been growing in line with the very fast growing market, continuing to well compete with mass and all the mass brands, despite some of them are now using prestige codes, they continue to grow on average less than the prestige brands. So M\u2022A\u2022C continued to be one of our most successful brands and a fast-growing brands and we will count on this for the future. In the U.S., there is the specific two issues in the short term that we have already commented on, which is obviously M\u2022A\u2022C is very concentrated and focused on high internal distribution presence in high touristic areas and in mid-tier department stores. And in the traffic in both of these areas has been lower, significantly lower than in the past. And so M\u2022A\u2022C will need to react to that. The second is the programs. And you're right, there is new competition. There are some very successful brands. We have acquired one of them, BECCA, and there are many other successful brands, particularly in specialty multi, which are a new competition among the millennial generation. And M\u2022A\u2022C is stepping up their activity, their innovation, their collection, their social media and their penetration of this new target group with new activity. That's why in our prepared remark we brought up the example of the Selena and what's happening there when M\u2022A\u2022C speaks to this target group more directly. And we plan to do those much more also in the second semester of the fiscal year. So net, we expect M\u2022A\u2022C to continue to be one of our strong growth brands in the long-term. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I actually want to take a step back and think about your long-term algorithm because within that algorithm, I know you've got objectives to grow the top line while also expanding operating margins and improving free cash flow. But it seems philosophically as though maintaining the top line at 6% plus really dominates the other two. And arguably, that's not wrong, assuming the 6% plus growth is there. But I guess as we hear questions today related to the top line, what would it take for you to see whether in your business or in your end markets where you'd say, you know what, we're going to throttle back just a bit on top line investment and seek to generate similar profits, maybe improve free cash flow by going more after margin. I guess is \u2013 my concern is that you've been growing 6%, 7%, 8% in a market growing 4% to 5% for a while. And clearly, that can't go on forever, at least not without significantly higher costs. And I think the market's concern is that's what we're starting to see this quarter. And to that point, if you do happen to trend short of 6% in fiscal 2017, I think the market's fear is that you'll continue to spend as if you were still growing at that level, leading ultimately to deleverage and EPS reductions. So can you just help frame for us how you're monitoring top line trends and give us confidence that if the revenue does start to fall short, that the flexibility you've been speaking of the past few quarters can be applied to cost management to better protect bottom line and in the fact \u2013 even in the face of top line disappointment? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yes. I would like also Tracey to add on this. But first of all, our \u2013 in a market which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%. And again it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of course, there could be 6% in others, depending upon the external situation and in \u2013 of our internal innovation program and priorities and spending, as you mentioned. So I still believe the range for the long-term is the right range. And we are moving into that and continue to use this range as an opportunity. The key areas' opportunities \u2013 we continue to have pricing power. So as we say, in our \u2013 for example, in our 6% to 7% this year, which is a representation of our long-term view, is two points are coming from pricing. And then 2.5% are coming from distribution and 2.5% from organic growth. So our portfolio of brands, as Tracey explained before, still offer a lot of opportunity of more distribution of at least half of our brands, which are high growth, high productivity and not at all available to the global consumers in many areas. And this will be true for many years to come. As an example, even our recent acquisition, BECCA, has enormous opportunities for going also international, online, in travel retail and all these areas which will build value and today are not leveraged by a brand which is doing very well among its target group. And we have plenty example of this in our portfolio. The 2.5% organic growth in a market, which is growing 4% to 5% in prestige that continues to grow much faster than mass is frankly achievable if we get our plans together. So we still believe that the 6% to 8% range is achievable but also is possible that in some years will be 6% and not 8%, as we have demonstrated in the past. In terms of your second question, which is our flexibility is actually the key point. Our financial flexibility is there, and we are regularly adjusting resources due not only to the overall growth level but also to the different priorities that we have around the world and to reallocating resources to the winning areas. That, I believe, is the most important element of flexibility we have demonstrated to have. Why this it important? Because in this moment, the markets around the world is very volatile and there is a lot of change going on. So the ability to adapt and to reallocate resources in an agile way is one of the biggest strengths that I think we can exercise to continue to succeed. And we are ready to do it. We are prepared to do this, and our Leading Beauty Forward program, among other benefits, is also the benefit of making us stronger in our ability to do exactly that. So to close on your question, yes, we are committed to adjust and adapt cost to the future sales growth opportunity that we will have. Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Stephen, so the only thing I will add on to what Fabrizio has already said, some of the margin gains that we are achieving through our SMI program and other cost initiatives are in fact being offset by acquisition accounting and currency. So we are seeing almost an equal cost set in terms of some of the benefit that we're achieving from an organic growth standpoint with some of those factors. As I had mentioned, I think, on our year-end call last year, that purchase accounting will bleed off over the next year or so, and you'll actually start to see some more of the margin flow through. One of the things that we also look at here obviously is EBITDA, given the fact that we have done a number of acquisitions in the last few years. And certainly you see more progression in terms of our EBITDA margin. Operator : Your next question is from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Again, my question is around margins, and just \u2013 in your 2% or 2% to 2.5% organic long-term growth, are you factoring in the likelihood of a -- some years where two or three of your biggest brands are down in your biggest market, which is what we're seeing right now, and I think it would be helpful to understand why M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. should get back to growth, separate from innovation. But just given where travelers are going, you're benefiting in the UK. Is it realistic that M\u2022A\u2022C gets back to growth, based on everything you are seeing right now? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yes, it is realistic that M\u2022A\u2022C gets back to growth. But also the point that I keep making is diversification. M\u2022A\u2022C is a big global brand. The U.S. is less than 30%, three zero, of M\u2022A\u2022C volume. The rest of M\u2022A\u2022C growth around the world can be double digit, has been high single digit in the quarter we just closed and is projected to be double digit. So a brand that has double-digit power really demonstrated an enormous amount of opportunity, including extra distribution opportunity internationally, is a brand that can definitely grow and go back to growth very fast. Now, in the U.S. specifically, the growth \u2013 to go back to growth, there will be certain actions that are required, including new successful innovation and some other activity in social media that I can understand you say they need to be proven successful before believing them. But we know what they are, and so we trust in them. But even in terms of mix, the power of the brands will allow a double-digit growth in the medium, long-term. And then on the \u2013 what was the first part? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: It was really more \u2013 the big brands and then Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, and then stabilizing, which is what we spoke about happening. So that actually is progress. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: That's right. Sorry, I didn't get the Lauder/Clinique part of the question. So then on Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, as we said, we have stabilized the brands. These brands have been declining in the past. We have stabilized them, and we have started growing consistently the makeup part. As we said, we have said that our program was to start growing from makeup, and now the quarter we just closed is one more quarter where this seems to be now sticking and we keep doing this well. By the way, makeup is one of our priorities, and a lot of the growth in the second semester of this fiscal year as we anticipated will come from makeup acceleration. And Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique will be part of contributing to this makeup acceleration in the second part of the fiscal year. Next, we need to address the skin care trend on these two brands. This has been slower than what we wanted, but in the situation with Hong Kong not really been declining and the traffic softness in U.S. department store, which are two of the biggest skin care contributors to these brands, has been tough. But we have now plans to also add skin care acceleration to the already achieved makeup acceleration. In our \u2013 the last thing I want to say, in our plan we play the portfolio brands. And I said other times that we have one-third of our portfolio which is growing always double digit. One-third of our portfolio that could be just growing single \u2013 low single digit and one-third of our portfolio that is growing high single digit. And in this way, we delivered the total. And so, yes, we are not seeing the big brands have the role to drive the 6% to 8% on the high side. The big brands have the role to drive growth. But there are the other brands in the portfolio we are driving double digit and the portfolio mix is what driving our long-term algorithm. Think of it like one-third pricing, one-third distribution, one-third organic growth and one-third small brand, high growth brands, one-third the medium size brands and then the big brands. And that's why this flexibility of managing through the different levers of growth and the different brands in the portfolio in the different countries make us a more \u2013 a less volatile, more reliable, more sustainable company than any other company. Today, companies that just count on one or two brands, given the volatility of the world and only one or two markets I believe are less reliable in the long-term than the model that we build. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Bill. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Can you guys just bridge the gap for us between sort of the 7% to 8% makeup category growth and the 1% you reported? Because if I did the math \u2013 and I think Fabrizio just said that only 30% of M\u2022A\u2022C sales are in the U.S. So if you assume that international business grew 7%, in line with the makeup category, does that mean the U.S. was down 20%? So I was just sort of trying to figure out, like, what is the source of the volume or share losses? And how do you fix it? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, so I'll start. I think we talked about three markets that were softer than last year, some due to macro factors. The U.S. was obviously one of those. France, which had an exceptionally strong first quarter last year, is softer for obvious reasons this year and the Middle East. I mean those are \u2013 and those are big markets for M\u2022A\u2022C and \u2013 for makeup in general and certainly for M\u2022A\u2022C. And we expect throughout the balance of the year, A, we won't be anniversarying \u2013 we'll be anniversarying some of the events. But in addition to that, we do expect a pickup in the \u2013 all of those markets throughout the course of the year. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I want to add that Hong Kong is also a decent makeup market. Brazil is a very big makeup market in general for us and has been declining. And so it's been a \u2013 but there are other markets like China where \u2013 give you an example, M\u2022A\u2022C has been growing 20% more. And there are other markets in the world where the \u2013 our makeup portfolio is growing 30%, 40%. So it's not as simple as just one market explain everything. But the average of our international market has been doing very well. But Middle East, Brazil, low base in France, I also said Germany in my prepared remarks and Hong Kong are other examples of market that are driving down, but down significantly the growth. Middle East had a very difficult moment. And so double-digit declines numbers that are impacting in quarter one, offset by other phenomenon. So it's not only the U.S. But in the U.S. was specifically M\u2022A\u2022C. The rest of our portfolio in the U.S. has been performing well, as we anticipated also in the prepared remark, Lauder and Clinique makeup in the U.S. has been growing on both brands, for example. So that's the decision (47:53). How we fix it, I think I just said \u2013 just answered this question. We will improve the trend in M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S., continue to accelerate our distribution in that all of our makeup brands that have distribution opportunities internationally turn around our M\u2022A\u2022C organic growth in the U.S. and continue to accelerate our winning makeup brands around the world, also in the organic growth with more programs, particularly outstanding innovation and better social media plans. And we will activate the planned price increases in January that we plan to activate. Operator : Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Just housekeeping, specifically, can you give us the like-door growth in China in the quarter and the actual number for M\u2022A\u2022C? How much was M\u2022A\u2022C down in the U.S. and what was M\u2022A\u2022C's growth globally just for the quarter? And then my bigger sort of conceptual question. I get and I understand the opportunity for distribution expansion for so many of the brands in so many new markets. And I see why that will drive a third of your growth, and that's great. But my concern is that you are gaining more market share, it seems, through distribution expansion as opposed to with your own innovation. And I look at your two really big new products over the last year : New Dimensions and Est\u00e9e Edit, which we heard about for several quarters before they were launched. They were supposed to be game-changers. New Dimensions was supposed to set off a whole new category. Est\u00e9e Edit was supposed to revitalize the brand with millennials. And both of those brands have fallen well short of your expectations. And I know it may take time, and Est\u00e9e Edit may be a slow build, and all that kind of stuff. But my bigger question, Fabrizio, and you even mentioned it at Barclays, that the company is changing its focus less from blockbuster home runs, successful new product innovations, and more smaller things. But I'm just wondering how big a change that is culturally. Does that change the cost to compete? Those kinds of things because that strikes me as a very, very different philosophy or approach to building your brands and launching new products than we've seen historically at the company. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, you raise a lot of questions. So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retail touched double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%. M\u2022A\u2022C in China grew outstandingly, and our same-door in China grew in 2%. And so that's the situation. So we have again good, interesting growth in China. By the way, this is also driven by our makeup brands in a big way and by the makeup part of our heritage brands as well. And M\u2022A\u2022C is a really strong driver of this growth in China among others. Same thing in Korea. We are competing very well with Korea brands. We have another quarter in which in Korea we have been a very strong retail and continue to grow market share in the country of Korean brands, which make us very competitive \u2013 and again this has been driven by a lot of our makeup brands as well including M\u2022A\u2022C. The second part of your question is the innovation plan. Yeah, definitely, New Dimension was below our expectation, and in fact by the way, the launch of New Dimension last year was in the first quarter. And part of what we see in skin care this year in terms of base is that we are anniversarying a base where there was the launch of New Dimension that although below our expectation was significant in terms of overall volumes of innovation. And the future of our innovation is changing, as I explained in the Barclays Conference and the rest, meaning there are some very exciting innovation and less blockbusters. We believe this is much more in line with current consumers' expectations where consumer wants to try new products and have a variety of them. And the model is not \u2013 the breakthrough model assumed a lot of advertising before the product is in store. So in reality, it's higher risk financially. While the model where we use the growth, the innovation to attract new consumers and to engage them, and then when we see success we further accelerate and further leverage this innovation is the model that particularly in our midsized and smaller brands is much more manageable and allow faster and better financial results from these innovations than in the past. So the idea, we are going to have a mix. We still are going to have some breakthrough technology innovation and some more commercial innovations, including product packaging, aesthetics, et cetera, innovation. The fact that a lot of the growth comes from makeup is increasing the percentage of innovation, which is not about breakthrough technology obviously, but this is still part of our portfolio. But the way in which we will launch even this breakthrough technology will be with less risky upfront investment and more gradual evolution of the winners. And that is a change in our innovation program and is a change that will be \u2013 is associated already with some great results where we have the right innovation and will be associated, I believe, with a lot of good success in innovation. As we said before, last year, we went from 20% of our sales growth coming from innovation in fiscal year 2015 to 24% coming in fiscal year 2016 from innovation. In terms of the cost of innovation, which was the last part of your question, frankly, I believe it's the opposite. This new improvement of our innovation program is decreasing the cost of innovation, because it's decreasing the risk of it. It's decreasing the amount of money that are put upfront on innovation that don't work and are allowing us a better agility in tailored resources where the consumers react positively to our innovation. So it's increasing the effectiveness and the rate of return on our innovation. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thanks for the question. Fabrizio or Tracey, given the importance of the December quarter and the overall year, can you just maybe give us your overall macro undertones that you are kind of assuming in your forecast for the second quarter, just to kind of give us a feel on how much potential cushion or risk you are baking in, just given the environment right now? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So I'll start, Nik. It certainly is difficult to predict the environment, certainly most near term here in the U.S. But at least the election uncertainty will be over next week and we can move forward. I think that we are very pleased with the programs that we have to take advantage of the holiday season. And M\u2022A\u2022C has an incredibly strong giftable program this year. And so we're very excited about that. Certainly, we expect that that is going to drive a great amount of volume and sales for M\u2022A\u2022C. In terms of Jo Malone, many of our brands are fragrance brands. Obviously, we're well-positioned for holiday. We are still mindful of the fact that there are many parts of the globe that are weak and certainly Fabrizio talked about some of those, Hong Kong, the Middle East. We're not expecting a big pickup in those markets in the second quarter and the holiday season. We expect the UK to have a bit of a pickup certainly given the currency favorability there. We do expect that that will be the case. And we were actually in the UK last week and certainly saw quite a bit of traffic in the UK in the shops. So I would say it's a mixed bag. I think we're very in tune with what's happening around our globe and certainly our regional presidents are as we migrate into this holiday season. And I think we feel we have an incredibly strong lineup across all of our brands including Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique for holiday. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. And the other thing I want to leave you with is about our assumptions. We do not assume Hong Kong to go back to growth this fiscal year. We do not assume Middle East to go back to growth this fiscal year. We do not assume U.S., depart \u2013 mid-tier department store big improvements in the course of the year. We assume they will not further deteriorate, but we do not assume big improvements. And the rest is we assume that we will be able to reallocate resources depending on the volatility we see in the other element of economical and political volatility around the world. Operator : Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The first \u2013 good morning. I just wanted to clarify, Fabrizio, what you just said about Hong Kong, Middle East, and U.S. department stores, that was \u2013 you are not expecting them to be positive for the fiscal year or for the calendar \u2013 like for the second quarter? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: We \u2013 both. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So Hong Kong... Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Now, by positive, depending what you mean positive. I said I don't expect Hong Kong market to grow in the fiscal year and definitely not in the next three months. We don't expect Middle East will be positive in the fiscal year and definitely not in the next three months. And I said we don't expect U.S. department store to further deteriorate in the level of traffic for the remaining of the fiscal year. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I'm wondering if you can comment on M\u2022A\u2022C growth, excluding new distribution outside of the U.S. and how sustainable current double-digit growth is. And sort of broadly, we've estimated M\u2022A\u2022C has driven somewhere around 20%, 25% of company sales growth in recent years. So if it's slowing, and I get the comment about international being called 70% of brand volume, but how much can the company make up with acquisitions or other, assuming that the rest of the portfolio doesn't accelerate? And why or why not is this a good way to think about that? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, the way \u2013 as I said before, the way you need to think about that is one-third of our sales will be growing single digits and one-third of our sales or our brands will be growing double digit and then one-third will be in the middle, as I said before. And this \u2013 you can make the same assumption by channel, by country. We manage the portfolio different growth levers. So specifically to M\u2022A\u2022C, M\u2022A\u2022C is internationally, so outside of the United States, M\u2022A\u2022C is a relatively untouched brand in terms of price and distribution in many countries. Take countries like China where M\u2022A\u2022C is really, really untapped, enormous opportunities only in a limited number of cities and a lot to go. And there are many examples like that. And there are other places where M\u2022A\u2022C is well penetrated, well developed like the U.S. or the UK. So it depends by the mix. Each one of these brands have a very different mix in portfolio. That's why I don't think we are going to deploy every single brand and every single opportunity in price and distribution and organic growth brand per brand. And that's why I summarize with the one-third, one-third, one-third. And then your \u2013 so this will continue. And the second part of the question is the role of acquisitions. Yeah, we have \u2013 in the fragrance business, the role of acquisition has been to create the engines of growth of this new high-end artisanal fragrance category where we want to lead and to drive growth. And I think this quarter you see for the first time a very significant sign of that and the potential of it in the long-term. We are doing fragrances what we did in makeup \u2013 past history on makeup. And then we'll continue to drive that. In the other categories, acquisition will play a role like they always played and will continue to play a role to create the right portfolio brands and to create the right possibility of growing in areas where we have strategic opportunity or strategic gaps. And so you can expect us to continue leveraging acquisition and continuing analyzing the opportunities on your acquisition in the future to manage these strategic gaps or opportunities. And last, we have also some minority investments around the world that could be very interesting in the long-term. For example, Dr. Jart+ in Korea, which is one of the fastest growing Korean brands where we have a minority investment, there could be an acquisition in the future as an example of strategic opportunities that we continue to monitor \u2013 to enrich our different engines of growth. And to close, I mean, we are building engines of growth, differentiated, different in many to diversify our opportunity for growth in the long-term. That's the key strategy. And frankly, we're making great progress on it quarter by quarter. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And the only thing I want to add to that is internationally, outside of the markets that we've spoken about, M\u2022A\u2022C growth from a comp store standpoint is strong and is expected to be strong throughout the balance of the year. So the international M\u2022A\u2022C business is quite strong. The travel retail business is quite strong for M\u2022A\u2022C as well. So I just want to... Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And the online is very, very strong. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And online as well. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: One specific issue is U.S. distribution platform on M\u2022A\u2022C and the competition in the U.S. That's the specific M\u2022A\u2022C issue that we have addressed and we will address in the next months.

To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor section of our website. During the Q&A session we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for the call. And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that in the second quarter we delivered our financial targets. Our sales grew solidly, up 5% in constant currency. It was a meaningful acceleration from the first three months. In constant currency, our adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 5%, reflecting strong growth in high profit channels and disciplined expense management coupled with phased growth leverage. During the quarter, we enhanced many important strategic growth levers which created positive momentum across our diversified business in our brands, channels, geographies and categories. These gains were fueled by strong strides in our innovation, social media and digital engagement. We continue to make priority investments through our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which is proceeding according to plan. I will elaborate on each of these in a moment. Our two biggest challenges currently are the brick-and-mortar business in U.S. mid-tier department stores, which continues to be impacted by soft traffic and a slowdown in consumer purchasing in the Middle East. Additionally, Hong Kong continued to be soft, and we remain cautious about the impact of political issues and terrorism affecting our business in certain markets. We also continued to be penalized by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Despite these headwinds, we continue to successfully activate many of the elements of our strategy, which give us confidence in the strength and sustainability of our business growth. The first successful element of our strategy is the positive momentum of our diverse brand portfolio, and we continuously build from this strategic advantage. In the quarter, our best performers were our mid-sized and luxury brands, which continue to gain devoted consumers and strengthen their desirable product offering and services. They are headed on a path to become big brands. Tom Ford, La Mer, Jo Malone, Darphin and the brands we acquired in the past few years generated impressive constant currency double digit growth globally. Tom Ford products were particularly well received, and the brand grew in every category in every region. Two of our big brands generated improved sales and grew globally in constant currency. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand sales increased mid-single digits with positive growth both in skin care and makeup. Est\u00e9e Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ was the largest U.S. skin care launch in calendar 2015 according to NPD. The brands' makeup sales increased in every region and globally were up double digits led by foundations and lip products. Est\u00e9e Lauder brand grew in every region, which included an acceleration in China and in travel retail. Makeup fueled growth in the UK where the brand has a high makeup penetration. M\u2022A\u2022C. global business also grew in constant currency, as we had anticipated. The brand international business further accelerated with double digit gains in most market as well as in travel retail. In the U.S., M\u2022A\u2022C. sales showed improvement versus the first quarter, but still declined, due primarily to weak traffic in brick-and-mortar mid-tier department store and its tourist-focused freestanding stores. We expect M\u2022A\u2022C. international sales to increase further in the second half of the fiscal year with continued rapid online growth, creative innovation, expanded consumer coverage in overseas markets including launching in new cities, improved merchandise in store and accelerating its successful efforts in social media. Our aim is to strengthen the brand competitiveness in the U.S. while investing behind its international momentum. We also strengthened our portfolio with the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, two of the fastest growing prestige makeup brands. With a strong millennial following, they extended our presence in specialty-multi retail, which is one of the fastest growing channels for prestige beauty. Too Faced joined our company in mid-December, just as it was introducing its Sweet Peach collection, which became its most successful launch ever. The collection attracted nearly 100,000 consumers online who waited up to four hours to make a purchase. We were excited about the prospect of maximizing the potential of BECCA and Too Faced forward, as we are doing with our other new brands. The other acquisitions we made over the last two years are growing rapidly. We continue to integrate them into the company while we expand their consumer coverage and offerings. As an example, we launched Le Labo in Nordstrom and created a new fragrance set, which were popular gifts and best sellers online. Our important strategy of diversifying our distribution to expand our consumer coverage is progressing well. We are evolving the company distribution footprint to meet consumers' changing shopping patterns. We are accelerating the execution of the strategy as some U.S. department stores closed unproductive doors while our most profitable channels delivered outstanding performances, including specialty-multi retail, travel retail and online, all of which rose double digits in the quarter. We have deep experience successfully managing our business across a wide variety of distribution channels, for example in the UK and in many European countries. In a fast-growing specialty-multi retail channel, we are increasing our presence by launching more brands globally to reach new consumers. In the quarter, we launched Est\u00e9e Lauder initially in 30 ULTA stories in the U.S. and on ULTA.com and had very strong results. Clinique's expansion in the channel included more than 50 new doors with Sephora in JCPenney where it was the number one skin care brand in those doors. Outside the U.S., Clinique launched in the largest specialty-multi retailer in Korea. In travel retail, our strategy to make our limited distribution brands more widely available and offer a broader portfolio of brands in the channel has yielded outstanding results. We have broadened our makeup offerings in travel retail to capture growing demand while Jo Malone growth has helped drive a reinvigorated fragrance business, and we are introducing some of our newer artisanal fragrance brands to airport locations. Our retail sales growth was more than double the 8% passenger traffic growth in the channel, as more than half of our top 30 travel retail markets posted double digit gains. However, it bears mentioning that travel retail remains volatile, as political issues as well currency fluctuation can cause significant changes in travel patterns. We continue to execute on our e-commerce strategy, which deliver accelerating double digit growth in the quarter, as we supported our own sites and retailer sites with new programs and innovation. Our sales were strong across brand sites, led by M\u2022A\u2022C, as well as retailers and third-party sites. Traffic in orders rose strong double digits compared to last year. We opened our \u2013 or launched an approximately 100 new sites globally for our brands and products, and began selling online for the first time in Hong Kong, the Middle East, and the Balkans. In North America, several brands had record-breaking online sales during holidays, including Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique, Origins and Aveda. We continue to focus on mobile engagement and saw significant growth in traffic, which drove m-commerce sales increase of 75% over the Thanksgiving Cyber Monday weekend. Our brands on retailers' site also posted double digit growth in the quarter. Our online business was exceptionally strong in China, where sales nearly doubled, thanks to a highly successful single day on Tmall. During that event on November 11, sales of our six brand stores on Tmall were twice that of previous year. At Est\u00e9e Lauder, most of the consumers who purchased products that day were new to the brand on Tmall, illustrating the success of our strategy to reach new consumer through different channels. From a geographic standpoint, two of the largest markets we had expected to improve this quarter did so. Our business in France showed solid growth, and our U.S. sales improved, led by our high-end fragrance brands, which were big winners at holidays. Est\u00e9e Lauder's Blockbuster Set helped drive traffic and sold out weeks before Christmas. Our sales in China were strong, with many of our brands rising double digits. La Mer was a standout, driven by the successful launch of its Renewal Oil and Skin Color Collection, a key entry in the fast-growing area that bridges skin care and makeup. The Skin Color line is at the incremental sales, and having a positive halo effect on the brands' skin care business. Makeup continue to be fast-growing category in China, and we are responding to the demand. M\u2022A\u2022C's growth in China was outstanding, as lipstick sales rose strongly. The brand's upcoming launch on Tmall is expected to further drive sales, particularly in cities without brick-and-mortar. We expect Est\u00e9e Lauder brands' momentum in China to continue. In our third quarter, we plan to launch its best-selling Double Wear Foundation in a cash room compact, (12:51) a package innovation that is coveted by Chinese consumers. Looking at our categories now. Our three major ones are growing solidly on a constant currency basis. Skin care returned to growth, and we have created a new profile growth engine with a fragrance category, with our now extensive portfolio of high-end fragrances, which includes Jo Malone, Tom Ford, AERIN at Zegna Sensa, (13:20) as well as newer brands such as Kilian, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mall, and Le Labo. They had growth of nearly 30% during the quarter. These luxury fragrance brands were primarily powered by strong new fragrance launches and social media. In addition, innovation is driving our success across multiple engines of growth, expanding our brands, regions, channels, and target consumer groups. We are leveraging opportunities across the largest, fastest-growing subcategories in areas of consumer benefits while creating a leading new breakthroughs. We are increasing our speed to market and creating more superior products. Additionally, our research and development team continues to develop new proprietary technology platform, and our innovative concept extend beyond product to also include packaging, delivery systems, merchandising, services, and even new approaches to digital engagement. One of our numerous products in packaging innovations is Clinique's Fresh Pressed Daily Booster. Launching this month, the Booster represents a new subcategory for our company. The product concentrated vitamin C is intended to be freshly pressed into our moisturizer to immediately brighten and even skin tone. Fresh Pressed should also increase sales of Clinique core moisturizer business, since they are used together. Our brands are also focusing innovation around hero products and hero franchises, creating new offerings around a core collection is very efficient, and draws renewed attention to the brand priorities. For example, Est\u00e9e Lauder recently introduced new products to reinforce its two biggest franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, and it paid off, as both grew double digits. In the U.S., sales of the core Advanced Night Repair Serum rose 17%, boosted by its innovative Intensive Recovery Ampoules. And a new eye mask that just launched last month as part of the franchise should further lift the serum and the entire collection. I'm proud that several of these products are being recognized for their innovation. Last month, Est\u00e9e Lauder received Marie Claire's prestigious Prix d'Excellence Award in research and development for three products : Advanced Night Repair Powerfoil Mask, Advanced Night Repair Ampoules, and Revitalizing Supreme+. This award honors the most Innovative products of the year. Our innovation is helped by our brands' and retailers' websites, which play a key role as a marketing vehicle to raise awareness of our new products. Millions of people can research the latest launches and read ratings and reviews before purchasing. We will continue to invest in capabilities to further expand our presence online, and our brands are making important strides to stay on the cutting edge of social media, which continues to strongly influence beauty choices. As an example, in the last years, M\u2022A\u2022C has significantly increased its digital engagement. The number of global Instagram followers of M\u2022A\u2022C has increased by 75% to 40 million and its number of global Facebook fans has climbed sharply. M\u2022A\u2022C has launched local Instagram's account in several markets including Brazil, Germany and Russia and the content is shoppable. M\u2022A\u2022C's global makeup artists are engaging consumers with locally relevant content, as the brand is using more influencers a user generated cost to augment its messaging. We just announced a collaboration with 10 global beauty influencers and bloggers who will create their own M\u2022A\u2022C lipsticks. Our brands' actions to drive earned media value through influencers is working well a win made (17:58) gains in all product categories. As a company, we have tied to the number one position in earned media value share in Total Beauty is measured by Tribe Dynamics, which quantifies the value of digital content created by third parties about a brand. We have the largest corporate share in skin care and fragrances and we have tied for first in makeup. We have Tom Ford, Smashbox and now Too Faced a strongly growing share of engagement with influencers, which is reflected in the higher shares in prestige beauty. In the second quarter M\u2022A\u2022C strongly increased its social influencer engagement, which led to a 30% rise in earned media value. And in another impressive achievement in China, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was ranked number one and the only genius brand in the recent L2 China Beauty Index, which cited the brand leadership in digital marketing, mobile and social media. Now let me turn to outlook. We expect to achieve constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2017. This includes approximately 1% of incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of Too Faced. We continue to expect our sales and profits to accelerate in the second half. The stronger gains are expected to come from four main factors, including organic growth, regular price increases that took effect in January, increased consumer coverage tailored by brand and contribution from the recently acquired brands. There are certain brands, channels in countries that we believe will be superior growth engines. They include our luxury brands and the online, travel retail and specialty-multi channels. By market, we expect China to remain strong and Hong Kong should start stabilizing. As we capitalize on the best growth prospects, we are also managing costs and reallocating resources from lower growth area to priority ones, aided by Leading Beauty Forward. We continue to hire talent where we need skill sets and investing capabilities that will position us to win in the fast moving competitive world of global prestige beauty for the long-term. With a diversified business that's directed by proven strategy and powered by multiple engines of growth, which we have strengthened even further with our artisanal fragrances and our recent acquisition of fast-growing makeup brands, we are confident in our long-term outlook. Our results will continue to be fueled by the best brand portfolio and the best people in the industry which will drive our winning strategy and continue our leadership in global prestige beauty. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 second quarter results and then cover our expectations for the third quarter and for the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges. As you have seen from our press release this morning, net sales for the second quarter were $3.21 billion, up more than 5% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of By Kilian, BECCA and Too Faced contributed approximately 90 basis points of this growth, slightly less than half of that from Too Faced. From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 9% in constant currency with double digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy, France and Germany and emerging markets like Russia, Central Europe, the Balkans and India. Sales in the UK were also a major contributor to the regions' growth in constant currency, up high single digits. Last quarter, we called out France and the Middle East as two markets that pressured our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France returned to growth in the second quarter as prior year comparisons eased, although the country continues to experience lower levels of tourism than before. Net sales in the Middle East again fell sharply as distributors in the area continue to align inventory to weaker retail traffic. This trend is expected to ease slightly in our third quarter and more significantly in the fourth quarter as we anniversary the downturn. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 12%. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by a double digit increase in China and the Philippines followed by strong growth in Korea and Malaysia. Both Japan and Australia rose low single digits. Hong Kong sales continue to decline, although at half the rate of last quarter. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%. Net sales in the Americas grew 1% in constant currency. Latin America grew 7%, led by strong growth in Chile, Peru and Mexico, while Brazil and Venezuela remain challenged. Canada was flat, and the U.S. declined 1%, representing an improvement from last quarter. Our sales in both the online and specialty-multi channels rose double digits. However, we saw continued declines in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores as well as tourist driven freestanding stores. Net sales by product category were led by the 11% constant currency growth in fragrances for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher margin luxury and artisanal segment of the category. Jo Malone fragrances again led the category growth this quarter as sales rose strong double digits, reflecting a very successful holiday program and expanded consumer reach. Fragrance sales from Le Labo, Tom Ford and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle rose strong double-digits. Makeup sales rose 7% in constant currency. The biggest contributor was Tom Ford, which doubled its makeup business this quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Smashbox rose high single digits, and La Mer nearly tripled its small makeup business due to successful launch of a new foundation. M\u2022A\u2022C's makeup sales grew globally with strong results in travel retail and in Asia-Pacific. The brands in North America business improved from last quarter, but still declined low single digits due to slow foot traffic in its core channels of distribution. Clinique's sales were also soft as they were adversely affected by a promotional shift and the timing of new product launches. Skin care sales grew 3% in constant currency, a nice improvement from last quarter. Nearly all brands saw growth in skin care this quarter, led by double digit increases from La Mer, GLAMGLOW and Bobbi Brown, and solid contribution from Est\u00e9e Lauder. Hair care sales fell 7% in constant currency primarily due to the cadence of innovation on hair care products at Aveda. Our gross margin declined 90 basis points from the prior year due to \u2013 primarily to obsolescence, new product mix and currency. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased 60 basis points primarily reflecting prudent expense management and general and administrative expenses in addition to our cost savings programs and partially offset by higher store operating costs associated with our retail store growth. Operating income rose 1% and operating margin decreased 30 basis points. Net earnings decreased 1% to $454 million reflecting higher net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Diluted EPS of $1.22 was flat to the prior year, as reported, and grew 5% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.06 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.02 of dilution from our acquisitions, half of that from Too Faced. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to favorable channel mix and more prudent expense management. With respect to cash flow and capital allocation for the six months, we generated $824 million in net cash flows from operating activities and we invested $208 million in capital projects and $1.7 billion to complete the acquisitions of both BECCA and Too Faced. The acquisitions were financed with both cash on hand and commercial paper. We continued to return cash to stockholders using $363 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares of our stock and $236 million to pay dividends. So we are pleased with our Q2 results. Now let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. With the inclusion of our acquisitions, we expect sales to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year, reflecting approximately 2 points from pricing, approximately 2 to 3 points from distribution as we expand the consumer reach of some of our brands, and 2 points from innovation and the acquisitions of By Kilian, BECCA and Too Faced. We expect Too Faced to contribute more than half of this impact. Currency translation is expected to depress sales by 2% reflecting weighted average rates of $1 or $1.08 for the euro, $1.25 for the pound and $1.11 for the yen for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.29 and $3.33 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.16 of dilution from currency translation and $0.07 dilution from the recent acquisitions, of which $0.04 is from Too Faced. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 9%. For the fiscal 2017 third quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 7% to 8% in constant currency, including the incremental impact of acquisitions of approximately 350 basis points to 400 basis points. Negative currency translation is expected and estimated at approximately 2 percentage points. The Middle East is expected to see sequential improvement over the next six months, as I indicated previously. Net sales began to slow sharply in the second quarter last year and declined about 15% in the fourth quarter. We expect to see more normal ordering patterns emerge as inventory becomes more aligned with current sales trends in the Middle East. Hong Kong is another market where we expect sequential improvement as the tourist business there has started to show a stabilizing trend. Our business in U.S. mid-tier department stores is expected to continue to remain challenged. EPS is forecast to be between $0.65 and $0.70 before restructuring charges. This includes dilution of about $0.03 from currency and $0.03 from acquisitions. We delivered the first half within our sales range and importantly, above our EPS forecast in constant currency. We remain focused on delivering our full year guidance against an accelerating backdrop of political, economic and currency volatility. The political landscape around the world shifted considerably in 2016. We've recognized the potential challenges this changing landscape presents, and there maybe implications for our business in the U.S. and around the world. While we remain committed and constant in our strategy, we are somewhat cautious in the near-term as a result of the global macro uncertainty. We are very proud that despite the headwinds we have experienced, we continue to proactively manage our business around the globe to deliver excellent sales and profit growth with our amazing teams. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Operator : The floor is now opened for questions. Questions will be taken in the order in which they were received. To ensure everyone has the opportunity to ask their question, we will limit each person to one question. Time permitting, we will return to you for addition questions. Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Leading Beauty Forward, actually, particularly given you guys \u2013 you referenced it a little bit. And my understanding or my interpretation of the program has been that in part, it's about investing for the future in new channels, new distribution and so on and new business systems more for more digital e-commerce freestanding stores et cetera. But the part of the reason we don't see sort of a margin benefit from the restructuring element of this is, you need to keep your infrastructure around, for example, U.S. mature department stores fully intact until this new system is up and running. Can you just \u2013 is that a reasonable way of thinking about it? And given how sharply the U.S. piece of this is declining, is there an acceleration in sort of being able to take some cost out of this, if you'll call it legacy, distribution model? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, no, so thank you for the question, Lauren. Leading Beauty Forward actually is comprised of multiple programs, as you suggest. Some are \u2013 were shorter term and some are longer term, because they require structural changes. One of the things that we are looking at, to your point, is, in light of some of the acceleration that we're seeing in channel shifts in some parts of our business, certainly in the U.S., how we might look to accelerate different components of Leading Beauty Forward. We are aggressively pursuing, expanding our digital capabilities in the company. We are aggressively pursuing looking for other cost savings opportunities under the Leading Beauty Forward program, as well as other \u2013 our other cost saving programs as well. But Leading Beauty Forward, the reason why we indicated initially, when we announced the program, that there was no cost savings this year and we would see some next year, but it was included within our guidance for next year, was just the timing of some of the longer term items that were planned under Leading Beauty Forward that required some structural change. But certainly, we are looking, as we always do, aggressively to accelerate opportunities as we see them. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, and just to add one aspect (33:51) that, beyond reducing cost and doing of what Tracey is explained, I believe one of the key benefits in the next two, three years of Leading Beauty Forward, to reallocate resources to the fast-growing opportunity and the fast-growing businesses that we have around the world. So this should further enforce our strengths, on top of creating more cost saving and more margin over the long-term. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So, I have a couple things. One is, from a top line perspective. At least to our math, based on your disclosures last quarter of sales and growth rates on your acquisitions, all of your acquisitions together this year, including the growth of those acquisitions, should be adding close to 3 points to your top-line growth. So, not just the sales, but the sales and the growth. So does that mean your underlying organic local currency growth is about 3% to 4% for the year? And if yes, how should we think about the, I guess, attainability of your longer term 6% to 8% local currency sales growth target, which I get is only about 5% to 7%, excluding typical 1% M&A, that's on a top-line? And then the second question I had was on your inventory levels. I'm still just shocked that it's not improving. Your own inventory levels look like they're up about 20% year-on-year, and I guess I'm kind of disappointed and surprised, given SAP is now in place and you should see some improvement, and hopefully it generates more cash flow there. So thanks on those two questions. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: All right. Thanks, Ali. I'll start, and perhaps Fabrizio will join in. And the two questions are actually related, right? In terms of why we're not seeing some of the improvement that we had expected to see this year in terms of inventory. So our underlying business, if you exclude Kilian and Too Faced and BECCA, is more in the 4% to 5% range. So you're correct with your math. And that is for the reasons that we shared in our press release and in our prepared remarks. We are seeing some pretty strong challenges here in the U.S. in mid-tier department stores. The Middle East, which is a very \u2013 has historically been a very strong growth and profit market for us, is challenged, and we've talked about Hong Kong now for the last couple of years. So those are the primary drivers. We expected a bit of a different mix in terms of the business, so that has left us with some higher inventory levels in some of our brands. In other brands, we've actually had to chase inventory, because they are growing faster than we expected, like Tom Ford and Jo Malone and some of those brands. And we're managing all of that, obviously, to deliver the results that we shared with you this morning. We are still committed, certainly, to leveraging SAP. It has helped us tremendously as the portfolio has become broader and more complex, to manage in more volatile time. So thank goodness we have SAP and we, along with our supply chain and business partners, can manage the different flows of inventory as situations change around the globe. But we are still committed to the levels of inventory management that we have shared with you at the end of our year last year, as we gave our three-year guidance. And we'll certainly update that in August. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And I just would like to add one thing on the top-line, which is \u2013 yeah, 4% to 5% organic plus acquisition is what we see today. And actually, all what we are doing in terms of action is to improve the ability of all of these elements to grow faster in the future. Meaning the organic is \u2013 the good news, there are so many very strong drivers of growth within the current organic travel retail. China gains, stabilization of Hong Kong, continue of online, and they're all accretive in term of margin. So the organic, with the activity that we are doing and with actually \u2013 with the decrease of the department store in the U.S., which is, at this point, the most disappointing performance as part of our portfolio, this part is decreasing as a percentage of business. What is increasing as a percentage of business are all the fast-growing channels and fast-growing activity. So the 4% to 5% can become stronger over time and not weaker, plus the acquisition. Now the acquisitions are doing fantastic. We acquired great brands, both this concept of artisanal high-end fragrances, which as I said in my prepared remarks, altogether growing more than 30% and the new acquisitions like Too Faced, the BECCA which have high growth brand into high growth channels. So the mix of improving our organics with a new change of mix and adapting to the new reality and the strong acquisition actually aims to reinforce our growth potential rather than dilute it. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And then the only other thing I'll add, Ali, to Fabrizio's remarks is back to inventory, just remember that in Q2, we also have included the inventory from our new acquisition, mainly Too Faced. Operator : Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I have a question on M\u2022A\u2022C. It seems that much of the brand softness in the U.S. has been due to issues that have been outside your control like weak tourist volumes and weak traffic at mid-tier department stores. So, first, would you agree with that point? And then second, in terms of what's in your control, you did mention some success you've had with your social media presence which is great, but curious how effective some of your promotions have been with M\u2022A\u2022C and whether you've had success in attracting new consumers to the brand. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, no, I frankly disagree that over what's happening on M\u2022A\u2022C is out of our control. There are two things which is happening on M\u2022A\u2022C One, which is a soft traffic in the distribution where M\u2022A\u2022C is present and we need to correct that over time. And so it's kind of in our control. We can correct that. And second, if M\u2022A\u2022C had to make improvements in the social media activity penetration and we are making these improvements. And this is in our control and it's an area that we could do better. We are doing better as I explained and we'll continue to do even better. And the third part is marketing programs. M\u2022A\u2022C quality of collection, quality of innovation will need to improve and continue to improve in the U.S. and we are working on it and some of the things have been already visible in quarter two and more to come in the next quarter. So it's not only a distribution adjustment, it's also a consumer engagement opportunity and also an innovation programs opportunities and we are addressing all of these three. Then I want to add that on M\u2022A\u2022C we are also working on new freestanding store formats that will address the ability to have freestanding store also in lower productivity situation while low tourist traffic because they will be smaller, more connected online, more engaging for consumers and more profitable. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just I had a question on the gross margin line. The gross margins came in a little bit light compared to our expectations. Can you help us understand the key drivers for the decline and what your expectations are for the back half of the year? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Sure. So as I indicated in my prepared remarks, gross margin was impacted by some obsolescence. Product mix and in particular some of the programs that we have introduced this year have been a bit higher cost than prior programs so that has impacted our gross margin this year. And then there is some geographic mix in there as well and channel mix, so we have a lot of mix components. And then the last component is currency, so currency in terms of the transaction impact of currency has negatively impacted cost of goods this year and certainly that's what we had anticipated. In terms of the back half of the year, we still expect to have some gross margin pressure on as it relates to some of the higher cost programs. However, as Fabrizio indicated and as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do have incremental pricing that we've taken in the second half of the year, so that will help mitigate some of that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tracey, just to follow-up on your previous comment regarding price increases, if you could just give us some sense of historically how effective those have been and if we should think about it as an effective mix or if it's like-for-like pricing? And then as a counterbalance, how you're thinking about using discounts and promotion to drive conversion even on higher pricing if that's the thing we should think about? Does it give you a little bit more flexibility to use some promotional tactics? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, no, great question. So our pricing historically has been a combination of mix and like-for-like pricing. I would say probably a little bit more like-for-like than mix although I indicated obviously that we have introduced some higher cost programs which obviously have higher prices in both last year as well as this year. In terms of promotional activity, that's something that we have certain of our brands that have embedded within their operating model, promotions like Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and the gift with product promotions that they do. And in certain situations where the environment during certain times of the year becomes more promotional, we have the flexibility within our model to react and respond. And certainly, the U.S. is one of the places where around holiday, it has become more promotional and some of our brands have reacted and responded to that. And then the last place that we will use promotion is in a situation where we do have higher inventory levels with certain brands, and you might see some very short-term promotional activity to liquidate that inventory. So those are primarily the areas we use promotion. Sets have always been a part of our business, particularly in travel retail, and that's a form of value to the consumer. But by and large, we are not a heavy promotion company, and so we certainly use advertising and digital and social media now to drive traffic with the innovation of our products and the innovation of our marketing campaigns. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And the only thing I would like to add is that in a moment of evolution where consumers are really sensitive to innovation and to trying new products, one of the area of promotion where we are investing more is sampling. And we really are learning more and more how to make samplings very effective, also models that we call paid samplings which are very effective way to do sampling. So we are increasing sampling. And thanks to this, we are increasing the trial level of our new innovations. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, great. Thanks. So clearly, the 5% to 6% underlying growth that you're guiding to is still impressive versus what we've heard from other companies, but it is below the level you seemed confident in a few months ago, even while Q2 came in more or less along with expectations. So can you just help us better frame where that one muted outlook over the second half of the year is coming from because it doesn't look like your market expectations have changed all that much? You seem muted on department stores in the Middle East coming into the quarter, et cetera. And then secondly on expense control, which you've talked a little bit about. It looks as though your EPS guidance now reflects the higher FX headwinds that you called out plus the Too Faced solution and nothing else, despite that underlying top-line growth reduction of 200 basis points or so in the back half. So if that's correct, that implies a good deal of expense control to absorb the lower top line. And I know you \u2013 probably you alluded this in your prepared remarks, but could you or Tracey just provide more color on where that \u2013 where spending levels have been reduced relative to the October outlook? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Sure. I will \u2013 let me start from the growth. So we see the market 4% to 5%. Our goal \u2013 our, say, high-end goal has always been to grow at least 1 point more than market, meaning to continue growing market share. And we are delivering that and we believe we'll continue to deliver that in the long-term. Now to explain the detail of what happened. In reality, we are taking the estimate down 1%. That's what's happening, and we are obviously still deliver 6% to 7% thanks to Too Faced. But there is 1% less expected growth than there were before Too Faced. Now where this comes from and why we believe will accelerate in the second half. This comes from mid-tier department stores in the U.S. that did less than what we expected originally and comes from the Middle East, emerging markets mainly. Middle East, that was really tough, and Turkey. Turkey was a super high growth market for us and a very unfortunate event of the quarter two make Turkey grow much less than what we were expecting. And so this is what was the 1% less. But on the other side, there were many things that continue to do well actually that did even better than what we expected. So for example, the improvements in Asia particularly in China are even better than expected. The trend stabilization of Hong Kong is very good news. The continued success of Korea is really amazing, and this has huge implication for travel retail. Frankly, the super high growth of travel retail, which show how our strategy is working is even better than what we could have anticipated. And the online continue to be very strong. So at the end, the net of this is that many of our engines of growth are getting better and better. Two of the things that took us down in the past, Middle East and Hong Kong are stabilizing, and the issue remains mid-tier department store U.S. where we do not anticipate a lot of improvements in this quarter, and that's what is the result. Of our estimate, you need to add to this that our acquisitions are very strong and they could do very well and even better, and so that's the other element of strength that we are adding to the second semester in our ability to deliver our goals. Now, Tracey, on the EPS? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yes, and so on the expenses, as I spoke previously, one of the things that we have done certainly is try to ramp up our cost saving programs in light of some of the softness we're seeing in some parts of the business. So some of the planned expenses that we had had in some parts of the business we have certainly pulled back on. We have cut back on travel, we have cut back on some of the consulting projects that we had planned to do this year that have been cancelled, and some of the hiring in certain areas that we had expected to do. So those are the primary areas that we've addressed in terms of expense management. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning, and thank you. I'm wondering what your advertising and marketing spend looked like year-over-year and as a percentage of sales, and if you can just help us think through the third and fourth quarter as to how that might flow? And do you see year-over-year maybe a decline in the fourth quarter? And the other question is around this gross margin, just the risk that has peaked given that a lot of your growth is coming from more extensive input and that you're driving sampling and so on. I'm just wondering if \u2013 we seem to have been missing margin goals for a number of reasons. I don't how much of that is currency and how much is just the change in portfolio? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Okay. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So probably I could (52:06) start and say our absolute advertising spending is going to be more or less stable across the year and will be \u2013 is assumed to be a bit stronger actually in the second six months, so in the six months we have in front of us, particularly in the third quarter because of innovation launches and activities. In terms of percentage of sales, so we'll slightly down in the year and this percentage is driven also by mix, meaning our advertised \u2013 or more advertised brands, I should say our traditionally advertised brands are becoming a lower percentage of our total business and our brands which are supported by different tools from social media to sampling and to others like in store activities are becoming a bigger percentage of the business. Because of that, you should assume an overall stability for the next months of our absolute investment, and a slight reduction of percentage of sales. In gross margin, Tracey, you want to comment on that? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, so in terms of gross margin, Caroline, as you know, and clearly we talked about some of the factors that are driving it this year, but you're right, the last couple of years, it's been relatively flat. That happens to correspond with a mix shift in terms of the significant growth of makeup and fragrance, and the slowdown in skin care. So we do have different gross profit margins depending on the category. We do also have certain of our cost activities that are targeted against cost of goods, and we do expect that that will continue over the next couple of years. And again, clearly, if the skin care mix picks up, that will also help gross profit margin. So I do think we can see, and we do expect to see, some increase in gross profit margin, but as long as makeup and fragrance are driving the best growth from a category standpoint, it will be somewhat suppressed. Operator : Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for \u2013 thanks for the question. I'm going to try to jam two in here. First, sort of a follow-up to the margin questions, or maybe it's a follow-up to Steve Powers' sort of flow through question. Fabrizio, in your answer to Steve's question, it sounded to me like you were saying there's also a mix shift by channel happening, so while you're getting slower growth, your slower growth is in lower margin channels, your faster growth is in higher margin channels, and this is helping to mitigate the bottom line impact of the slower top-line growth. So question one, is that a reasonable interpretation? And then second question, back to sustainability of top-line, 4% to 5%, we hear you on that sort of underlying. You've done 3.5% in the first half, on average. You're guiding to 3.5% to 4% in the third quarter and your full year guide implies something in the 6% to 8% range by the time we get to the fourth quarter. So how do we get comfort in the pace of acceleration, and should we view even the slightly lowered guide as still carrying a degree of risk? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So on the first question, the answer is yes. The evolution of our channel mix is accretive. But not only to margin, it's also accretive to growth potential, because we are swinging a bigger percentage of our business into higher growth channels, from what we see. So there is a positive margin and positive growth. And to your point, to your second question, I think \u2013 I believe I already explained. The key thing is that the key area of acceleration are pricing. We had pricing in January, which had about 2 points of acceleration. We had a lot of new \u2013 particularly for new brands \u2013 new distribution opportunities which are planned to start being impacting the business in the second semester, and there are 2, 3 points that will come out of new distribution. And this new distribution, I do mean \u2013 new distribution, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone in new countries, new cities. So it's not cannibalizing distribution, it's really coverage of consumer. That's why we call it consumer coverage opportunities. Plus, this includes some of the mix acceleration, meaning the moment Est\u00e9e Lauder brand successfully built doors in ULTA, and they were very well, these automatically create more distribution which grows better. So there is more of this in the second semester. Then there is strong organic growth, the innovation that is working, as we have explained our prepared remark, will now continue to impact and grow in multiple areas. I believe the good news is that skin care is growing again and is adding this engine \u2013 and the other good news is that the engine we just created with these fragrances \u2013 high-end fragrances \u2013 continue to grow (57:51) very well, and we continue to accelerate growth on a higher base. Plus, as I explained, Middle East and Hong Kong , they've been two negatives in the first six months, should be better in the second six months. And finally, the base is lower, frankly, particularly in quarter four. The base is lower, and so we believe that the combination of these things will bring our organic growth to the level that we are estimating. On top of that, the new acquisitions, Too Faced and BECCA, are doing very well, so \u2013 and we believe they will add the very significant sense of comfort to the ability to deliver the right growth, and by the way, this will continue into next fiscal year. Operator : We have time for one more question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Just following up on that, I mean I think \u2013 this is two quarters in a row where you've come in at the low end of your guidance, and yet some of your peers are saying the market's improved. And so I'm wondering, number one, what your commentary is on that. Do you think you have the right forecasting ability et cetera, et cetera, just to boost our confidence, if you will, in terms of the guide for the back half? The other question I had, Tracey, you've talked in the past about the point of, as you expand into specialty-multi, there is a risk that the productivity of your doors or your counters in department stores will drop and I'm wondering if, in the U.S., you are seeing that as you expand distribution, as you open up more of your own freestanding stores. Are you facing a problem at some of the mid-tier department stores, and is that putting pressure on your growth? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So let me start with the second question, Wendy. One of the things that our team is very careful about is the doors that we do open in specialty-multi and the distance they are from certain department stores. So we do look at the impact of cannibalization of doors and we haven't seen it. When we look at whether it's Clinique's performance or whether we look at Est\u00e9e Lauder, which is now starting to perform or expand in ULTA as Fabrizio said. We're not seeing that cannibalization. The net of the double points of distribution if you will are accretive and are growth for the brands. One of the things that and we have talked about in the past, Wendy, is that there is a shift in the retail landscape obviously in the U.S. where there is space being taken out of department stores that are closing doors and obviously we are working with them and managing to try to shift that business to online or to other department store doors. But then our specialty customers like Sephora and ULTA are adding doors every year and so we are adding our brands in those doors as well as they expand. And that's a shift I think we'll see for the next couple of years in the U.S. It's driven by consumer and consumer traffic patterns. It's certainly not driven by any of the actions that we're taking with respect to our business. If anything, we're trying to be where our consumers are shopping and they're shopping in multiple points of distribution. So I think what we're seeing and how we're managing it is the right way to go for both parts of our business. But, painful at least here in the near-term this year. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. And going back to the first part of the question is, yeah, we came at the low end of the guidance, but the guidance has a high end and a low end, so I would now conclude is that we have issues forecasting. The issue is the one I explained. The issue is that versus our competition. We are absolutely overexposed to mid-tier department stores in the U.S. particularly. And this very high exposure and we have been obviously hit harder than others on the soft traffic that this channel has experienced in the last year. And that's why we are trying to react to. We are trying to continue to diversify our business globally in order to be able not to be over-dependent by any channel, any country, any brand. And to have such a well diversified portfolio that we can deliver our 1 point ahead of market or more growth independently from any other area of the business or any specific area of the business. So frankly I'm very proud how we are pivoting the company in terms of online, TR, specialty-multi distribution, how we are pivoting the company in terms of social media versus historical or traditional way to engage the consumers, how we are pivoting the company to penetrate the makeup boom in a very aggressive way, how we are pivoting the company to split up and change our innovation models. We are pivoting and we are pivoting while continue to be one of the fastest growth companies in the consumer industry. I personally am very proud of my team in the way we are managing this. although we do recognize that we were at the low end of our estimate and we are overexposed to the soft and usual mid-tier department store in the U.S. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for the call. And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our company delivered an excellent performance in the third quarter. Our business accelerated, driven by many brands, channels and markets that experienced strong momentum. In constant currency, our sales rose 9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 28%, both of which exceeded our expectations. The outperformance was generated from stronger organic sales growth, largely in China in travel retail channel; a better-than-expected performance of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, as well as disciplined expense management. When fiscal 2017 began, we said our sales were expected to accelerate every quarter, culminating in a robust second half. As we look to the fourth quarter, our sales growth should increase farther, enabling us to deliver our financial and sales target for the full year and position us for a strong start in fiscal year 2018. Our success this quarter came despite continued external macro headwinds in certain areas. In the U.S., foot traffic continued to decline in brick-and-mortar department stores, our largest domestic channel. And Macy's closed 68 stores, as expected. In certain other countries, we faced difficult economic or political climates, particularly in the Middle East, Turkey and Latin America. And the continued strength of the dollar impacted our reported results. Globally, we encountered stiff competition from both established and upstart brands. The fact that we have achieved a strong performance against this backdrop speaks to our successful strategy, which is anchored by our increasingly diversified business model and multiple engines of growth. We also are benefiting from our choice to stay focused on a dynamic prestige industry that has been growing steadily for many years and continues to grow faster than many other household and personal care centers. As global prestige beauty undergoes rapid change, we are embracing new opportunities, accelerating penetration of the fastest-growing channels, reallocating resources to the leading business drivers and pivoting for the future in our industry. Consumers' appetite for beauty products is intensifying, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup, which fuel outstanding growth in our high-end brands and continued double-digit growth in our makeup category. In addition, we enjoyed superb growth in the fastest-growing beauty channels, with travel retail, online and specialty multi, each rising strong double-digits. By geography, we grew strong double digits in certain emerging markets, notably China. Altogether, we generated higher sales in every region and in our three largest product categories, fueled by an acceleration of our hero products, new product innovation and increased social media presence, new digital initiatives and greater penetration in the fastest high-growth channels. At the same time, we continued investing in priority areas and capabilities and our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Our diverse portfolio of brands continues to be a strategic advantage. We leveraged each brand in the most appropriate prestige distribution channels to target different consumer segments. This approach yielded outstanding results for our luxury brands including Tom Ford, La Mer and Jo Malone. Each generated double-digit sales growth in constant currency in every region. La Mer's new hydrating serum and brightening mask were well received and benefit from an increase in travel in Chinese consumers around the world. The brand gained share in Asia-Pacific and maintained its leading position in luxury skin care there. Among our largest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder achieved the solid growth globally for the second consecutive quarter, with higher sales in skin care, makeup and fragrances. The brand was well positioned to capitalize on increased travel and consumption from Chinese consumers, which favorably impacted its business in travel retail, the UK, and Asian markets and lifted its skin care sales. Est\u00e9e Lauder's makeup category excelled in Asia-Pacific with increases in face, lip and eye products. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand continued to support its two key hero franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, with new products combined with more effective marketing and communication. The investment paid off. The two highly desirable product lines reached the new consumer, posted positive growth in every region and increased double digit for the fiscal year-to-date. Around the world, Double Wear is the best-selling prestige foundation in many markets such as the U.K. and attracts consumers across generation to the brand, including millennials. We have successfully created a new growth engine with our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands and they continued to advance strongly, while at the same time improve the profitability of the entire fragrance category. Jo Malone and Tom Ford accelerated rapidly, particularly in travel retail and we also see great potential for our newer fragrance brands, Le Labo, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and By Kilian. This is the first full quarter that reflected a contribution of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA and their sales exceeded our expectations. We also started to extend their presence internationally. Adding these brands to our portfolio accelerated our penetration in both makeup and in the fast-growing specialty multichannel and increases our reach with millennial consumers. Indeed, many of our brands are expanding in fast growing channels to reach new consumer. Since today, they have wider choices of where to shop for prestige beauty products. In this regard, we are excited our M.A.C. brand will launch this month in Ulta Beauty, one of the fastest growing specialty multi-retailers in the United States. Ulta's consumer are devoted beauty enthusiasts and have been requesting the brand. M.A.C. will first be available on ulta.com starting next year, followed by about 25 stores beginning in June, with more than 100 doors planned by the end of December. The locations will feature dedicated M.A.C. makeup artists in a boutique-like setting, allowing M.A.C. to provide it exceptional artistry services. Expanding into specialty multi globally is integral to M.A.C's strategies to grow its consumer base, continue to raise awareness, become more accessible and drive incremental sales. Although M.A.C. is the number-one prestige makeup brand worldwide, it is in less than 3,000 doors, a fraction of the location of most of its direct competitors, in some cases, in even less than 15%. M.A.C. continues to make great inroads in specialty multi internationally. In Brazil, for example, M.A.C. is the leading brand on sephora.com and will open in some of the retailers' top brick-and-mortar stores this August. In Europe, M.A.C. is increasing consumer reach by opening more doors with Douglas, as well as other specialty multi retailers including KICKS in Sweden. Our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand launched in Ulta last fall in 30 doors and successfully tapped into a new audience. During the first three months, more than 40% of consumers who bought its products were new to the brand. And over 65% of the new makeup consumers were millennials. With strong sales results, Est\u00e9e Lauder plans to roll out to more Ulta stores. Clinique's experience in Ulta has been terrific and it is building on its business there with more in-store boutiques. By the end of fiscal 2017, our three largest brands will have strategically expanded their consumer reach in the U.S. specialty-multi channel. Several of our other brands have achieved strong sales in the U.S., specialty multi, including GLAMGLOW, Smashbox, Tom Ford in Sephora and Darphin in Bluemercury. During the quarter, we launched Jo Malone and La Mer into a few key Sephora doors, including its largest one that recently opened in Manhattan, and also on sephora.com. Initial response has been terrific. Both brands are recruiting new consumers from these efforts. Internationally, our business has also performed well in many specialty multi retailers, including Mecca, Boots, Douglas and (11:18). More specialty multi retailers are entering Korea, and Clinique and Origins have expanded their consumer reach to some of these new locations. Clinique and M.A.C. has launched in specialty multi in Thailand with fantastic results. We had outstanding results in travel retail, led by our business in Asia-Pacific. Our vibrant retail sales showed the strongest quarterly growth in over three years and far outpaced passenger traffic growth in the quarter. Sales increase in every product category. Makeup sales surged, led by M.A.C., Tom Ford, and several other brands. Higher skin care sales were driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer in the greater number of Chinese and other Asian travelers. And in fragrance, which still leads total beauty sales in the channel, we achieved the superior results and share growth, led by Jo Malone and Tom Ford. We believe there will be strong demand among consumers for our newer luxury and artisanal fragrance brands in travel retail as we roll them out, enabling us to further penetrate the channel's most important category. We also continue to expand the availability of our other brands that aren't widely distributed in travel retail, and brought more brands into more high potential airports. Our sales from our e-commerce channels continue to grow at an exceptional pace, up 30% globally, more than twice the growth of e-commerce in general. Sales rose double-digits across brand, retailers, and third-party sites, and also grew double digit in every region, driven largely by increased traffic, order size, and conversion. Mobile-driven sales rose significantly and are now a larger portion of our total mix. We entered Hong Kong, a new market for our online business, with a brand size from GLAMGLOW. And in China, our online sales soared, led by our brands on Tmall. M.A.C. plans to launch on Tmall this quarter, which should provide more fuel for our China business and allow M.A.C. to reach new shoppers in smaller Chinese cities who don't have access to its products in brick-and-mortar stores. Globally, we continue to successfully launch additional brands online in more markets. Department stores are striving to provide consumers with strong experiences they can't get anywhere else. International department stores remain strong, particularly in Europe and China. We continue to work our \u2013 with our U.S. department stores to create in-store and omni-channel excitement and innovate with product, services, merchandising, and education. We are devoting additional resources to the top doors and promoting in-store events on retailers' websites where, as I just mentioned, our business had been brisk. Research shows the consumer who shop both in-store and online spend more than those who buy in just one channel. We are being proactive with department stores to design strategies to reinvigorate traffic, while addressing productivity challenges in brick-and-mortar. Now, let me turn to our recent and upcoming innovations. Across our brands, we are focused on the biggest global opportunities, which in Clinique's case means its core products, like moisturizers. Its initial launch of Fresh Pressed serum and cleanser with concentrate Vitamin C was a global hit that garnered terrific attention and demand, and validated the brand's strength to leverage the initial success with a more extensive rollout in the coming months. The serum is used with the brand's moisturizers, which increases their sales as well. Fresh Pressed helped drive improving retail trends for Clinique in China and travel retail. In another move to strengthen its position in moisturizers, Clinique just introduced a supercharged hydrating formula of Moisture Surge, developed from proprietary (15:45) technology that is expected to elevate the best-selling franchise. Clinique marketing will focus on the instant benefits of Moisture Surge, which has been growing in most markets. Est\u00e9e Lauder will begin introducing Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix in July. This product, which contains innovative technology based on scientific breakthrough research, repairs the visible signs of aging on eyes to make eyes look refreshed, and features a custom designed massage applicator. It is one of the brand's highest scoring products in testing with consumers. For example, after four weeks of usage, almost 90% of women said their eyes looked more youthful. It will be supported by a 360-degree campaign, based on strong insights from consumers around the world. In makeup, we are very excited about Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear Cushion Compact for Asian market, which will be supported by strong investment in China, and Pure Color Love lipstick, a global launch that is aimed at younger consumers. M\u2022A\u2022C new Next to Nothing sheer Face Color is a lightweight foundation that makes skin glow. It is being supported with a major social media campaign that is already helping fuel M\u2022A\u2022C sales this quarter. In fragrance, Jo Malone launched Star Magnolia cologne, which is expected to have wide appeal, and Tom Ford created SOLE DI POSITANO, which evokes my fragrant (17:28) Italian coast. With the help of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, we continue to reallocate resources faster, and cut cost deeper, to invest in talent and capabilities that will drive our business in today evolving beauty landscape. This includes social media, digital technologies, retail operations, and analytical expertise. To help leverage both new and existing brands, our brands continue to increase their social media activity and capabilities to engage consumers across numerous digital platforms using influencers, brand ambassadors, and other compelling voices and technologies. For example, Smashbox collaborated with a popular influencer to help promote its Cover Shot Eye Palette, and the collection became one of the brand's largest launch ever. And in China, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand significantly lifted its makeup sales by leveraging a combination of in-store and social media campaigns. This kind of digital content created by influencers and third-parties is measured in terms of earned media value. In the third quarter, M\u2022A\u2022C remained the second largest beauty brand among prestige and mass makeup players in earned media value in the U.S., as measured by Tribe Dynamics. M\u2022A\u2022C has improved its earned media value share in makeup in each of the last three quarters. Our brands are also creating inventive digital experience for consumers. For example, a cutting edge technology used by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Smashbox lets consumers virtually apply different lipstick shades, either in real-time or in (19:16). Our performance this quarter further demonstrated our company strategy, built on multiple engines of growth and leading to agile resource reallocation, when need, is sustainable and working. Our company has the most desirable portfolio of prestige brands in the industry. And we are (19:38) to strategically deploy them brand across fastest-growing channels and consumer segments around the world. Importantly, we have the highest quality workforce with extremely capable people committed to our company's success. At the same time, we are reducing costs, redesigned for better sales growth leverage, and reallocating our resources to make priority investment in the most attractive areas that are expected to drive our growth in both the fourth quarter and next year. As a successful high growth company in a growing industry, we have continued to increase our global share in prestige beauty. And as we enter our fourth quarter, we are further building momentum to deliver another year of strong profitable growth. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 third quarter results, and then cover our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges, which are disclosed in our press release this morning. Net sales for the third quarter were $2.86 billion, up 9% in constant currency compared to the prior-year period. Incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 4 points of this growth. And the balance was driven by strong performance in several areas of our business, most notably travel retail, online, China, and our mid-sized and luxury brands. From a geographic perspective, every region grew sales, led by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Net sales rose 13% in constant currency in EMEA, led by a 30% increase in global travel retail. The substantial growth in travel retail was supported by an 8% increase in international passenger traffic, as well as further expansion of our makeup and fragrance brands in the best airports. Notably, our travel retail business in Hong Kong and Macau returned to strong growth in the quarter. We are closely monitoring the political tensions that have curtailed Chinese consumers traveling to South Korea but we do expect the slowdown in this travel quarter to be offset by Chinese consumers traveling to other Asian destinations. The EMEA region also benefited from strong sales in Italy and the U.K., which rose high-single-digits while most other Western European markets grew mid-single-digits. The region's major soft spot this quarter was the Middle East, where net sales fell again as distributors continue to align their inventory to much weaker retail traffic. This negative sales trend, however, did begin to ease this quarter and is expected to further improve in our fourth quarter as we anniversary the turndown. Excluding the Middle East, the total EMEA region grew 15%. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 8% in constant currency. Growth was led by China where net sales rose more than 20%. Most of our brands grew double-digit in China this quarter and our online business in China grew more than 70%. We also achieved solid sales growth in Taiwan and Malaysia, and both Japan and Australia rose low-single-digits while sales in Hong Kong continue to stabilize. Net sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency. Latin America sales grew 5%, led by strong growth in Mexico and Chile while Brazil remained challenged. Sales in North America benefited from the addition of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, as well as double-digit growth in both the online and specialty multi-channels. These increases were offset by continued declines in the brick-and-mortar business of department stores, as well as in freestanding stores. Our gross margin declined 160 basis points from the prior-year period due primarily to adverse product mix, including the impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisitions and the associated inventory step-up related to purchase accounting. Obsolescence was also a slight contributor to the margin decline. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 370 basis points, primarily due to lower selling and promotion expenses that reflected our changing channel mix, along with prudent expense management in line with softer sales in U.S. department stores and freestanding stores. General and administrative expenses also declined, reflecting the benefits of our cost savings programs, equity income from our investment in Have & Be Company, and the deferral of some IT and R&D projects to the fourth quarter. As a result, operating income rose a strong 23%, and operating margin increased by 210 basis points. Net earnings rose 24% to $340 million, reflecting the operating income improvement and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Diluted EPS of $0.91 was 25% above the prior year, and grew 28% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to the margin accretive sales beat, coupled with disciplined expense management by our teams, and the deferral of some projects to the fourth quarter. With respect to cash flow and capital allocation, for the nine months, we generated $1.25 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, and we invested $316 million in capital projects. And approximately $1.7 billion in acquisitions. In early February, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, which we used to repay outstanding commercial paper and to refinance $300 million in senior notes coming due on May 15. We also continue to return cash to shareholders utilizing $363 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares of our stock, and $361 million to pay dividends. Now turning to our outlook for the full year, we expect to end fiscal 2017 with sales growth of between 6% to 7% in constant currency, and that reflects approximately two points of incremental sales from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. Currency translation is expected to depress reported sales for the full fiscal year by nearly 2 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.08 for the euro, $1.26 for the pound, and $1.09 for the yen. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.32 and $3.37 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.13 of dilution from currency translation and $0.07 of dilution from the recent acquisitions. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 8% to 9%. Our sales in the fourth quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10% in constant currency, demonstrating the sequential acceleration in sales growth that we have anticipated throughout the year. The strong fourth quarter increase is expected to come from approximately four points of incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA, expanded consumer reach for our several brands, particularly in Specialty Multi, online and in our international free standing stores. Further improvement in Hong Kong as sales are expected to return to positive growth as travel to the area picks up. An easier comparison in the Middle East, as we lap the period of soft retail sales and destocking, and continued momentum in China and other Asia-Pacific markets. We are also committed to continue to invest behind our strategic priorities. We do plan to invest increased spending in our fourth quarter behind new products and marketing activities, support for the roll-out of the new distribution, such as M\u00b7A\u00b7C and ULTA and some projects in IT and R&D, information technology and research and development that were delayed from the third quarter. We expect fourth quarter EPS of between $0.35 and $0.40. This includes dilution of about $0.03 from currency and about $0.03 from acquisitions. We are successfully executing against our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives according to plan as Fabrizio mentioned and will continue to reallocate resources to strategic areas of importance. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results and are very proud that our organization continues to make great progress on achieving our long-term strategic objectives, while pivoting and successfully reallocating resources when necessary towards the fastest growth areas of our business. In this dynamic, ever-changing global macro environment, our success is a true testament to the collective efforts of our dedicated employees around the world. And that includes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking by question, and congrats on a great quarter. So my two questions are on BECCA and Too Faced. First, I wanted to get a sense of what type of growth rates you're currently seeing in those businesses? And then, it sounds like they're both trending above expectations, so just curious what's driving the above expectation performance so far? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So the growth is very, very strong in these two brands. So, it's very strong double-digit growth in each one of the two brands and in every segment they're operating. And what is driving the success is actually same-door sales is a success, which is driven mainly by same-door sales and for the moment, a very small initial distribution deployment. These two brands are really strong and consumer demand is exceptional. And their recent launches are among the most successful launches in the entire marketplace. And on top of that, for us, the great news are that they attract really new consumers that in the past we were attracting less, particularly Too Faced attract more younger consumers in our portfolio which is great extra business for the company overall. And importantly, they have dramatically increased our penetration in Specialty Multi in the U.S. And this will continue internationally, which is a very important objective because as you all know, the Specialty Multi-Channel globally is one of the fastest growing channels in our sector. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you can kind of elaborate more on basically the Clinique products into ULTA stores and how \u2013 I understand you've been there for five years, and how that learning can be applied to the M\u2022A\u2022C relationship? And along those lines, how you think about any cannibalization of the products within Specialty Multi against department stores. And second, if you could elaborate more on the fourth quarter guidance for margins, because it seems conservative against your beat of $0.21, and just $0.03 increase over the low-end of the guidance. So if you can give us what is your embedding in terms of investments? I understand from Tracey's comment that you had some R&D that might be pushed over to the fourth quarter. So if you can elaborate more on the investments? And again, congrats on the results. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you. I'll start with answering the ULTA question. So Clinique is very successful in the ULTA channel. And what we have learned is that when Clinique is exposed with all the strengths of the core (32:42) portfolio and the strengths of services to a good growing traffic, the brand responds very, very well. And Clinique is growing both makeup and skin care aggressively in every ULTA door in which the brand is deployed. In terms of what we can learn for M\u2022A\u2022C \u2013 by the way, as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan to increase gradually the number of Clinique doors in ULTA in agreement with our retail partner. And, as far as the learning for M\u2022A\u2022C, absolutely we have learned a lot for perfecting our upcoming M\u2022A\u2022C execution; also from the Clinique experience. In particular, we have learned the importance of the service aspect, of making sure that the brand is deployed with all the necessarily SKU, assortment SKU, and decorations of the SKUs to the consumer, is the concept of a curated assortment that really fit the consumer, which has been a big learning that will be absolutely applied to every one of our brands. The good news, that is true for Clinique based on your question, but is true for every other \u2013 our three big brands. Also Lauder is the same. We really attract new consumers and a lot of millennial consumers. So the cannibalization is very, very limited. This consumer, our consumer that were not shopping in the brands before in a large majority, or they were lapsed brand users, because they were not anymore going in channels that \u2013 where the brands today are distributed. So the large majority of the business is net extra business. Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And in terms of the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, because we have some very strong launches coming up in the fourth quarter, we also have a fair amount of consumer reach expansion into Specialty Multi, as well as some of the opening of our free standing stores and other points of distribution in the fourth quarter. And that's where the investment is coming in, in the fourth quarter. When you look at the \u2013 our expense mix in the fourth quarter relative to last year, it's relatively comparable. And again, our motto certainly here has been to start strong and stay strong. So, a combination of very strong launch and distribution activity in the fourth quarter, and certainly supporting products to accelerate into fiscal 2018 is what the fourth quarter represents. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. First, curious if you guys have detected any change in overall market growth for global prestige beauty from the 4% to 5% it was growing at earlier. And then secondly, a little bit more detail on the U.S. growth, with and without Too Faced and BECCA, and maybe what M\u2022A\u2022C did in North America this quarter? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So on the total M\u2022A\u2022C growth, no. We're not seeing a big change. Overall, it's still between 4% and 5%; probably closer to 4% in this moment than to 5%, but still in the range. And \u2013 but what we have seen a change \u2013 we see a change continuously is where the growth is coming from. And the growth is coming from \u2013 by category \u2013 is coming more from makeup than in the past, as you know. And by recently, in this quarter, the growth is again coming from Asia more than in the previous quarters. And then, certain emerging markets have been more challenged than in the past, like, I don't know, Brazil or Turkey, obviously, and a few others. And so, we see a variation where the growth come from. But what is interesting is actually the total growth is still between 4% and 5%. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And as far as the North America performance this quarter. As we indicated, the brick-and-mortar channels were pretty challenged, particularly in the U.S., in the third quarter. Excluding Too Faced and BECCA, the North America segment was down in sales, and M\u2022A\u2022C was certainly a contributor to that performance. The M\u2022A\u2022C team is working very strongly in the U.S. to accelerate performance, both in the department store channel and certainly in their freestanding stores, and has some great programs coming up over the next couple of quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to focus on the comment, Fabrizio, you made on the earned media value for M\u2022A\u2022C picking up in the third quarter. When you look back, what was driving that? Was it new product launches? Was it product placement with influencers? And then I guess just a housekeeping question in terms of the cadence of openings at ULTA. You talked about 25 in June and over 100 by year-end. Should we just kind of model the balance of that in the next quarter? Or how do we think about kind of the next couple of quarters in the calendar year? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, let me start from this last question, is \u2013 no, is what I said. You should not model it differently; is 25 by June and then 100, and you can assume that the 100 will be equally split, because it's a matter of capability opening. And the opening will be more aggressive as of September, obviously, because of organization and capability things. But this is the total number that we're planning for at the moment. What was the? Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Earned media for... Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Ah, the earned media value of M\u2022A\u2022C. So what was driving the improvement of the earned media value of M\u2022A\u2022C is, first of all, the M\u2022A\u2022C activation of many more influencers. And the activation also of M\u2022A\u2022C makeup artist has influenced themselves, which is a unique model created by the M\u2022A\u2022C brand. Meaning M\u2022A\u2022C is, obviously, activity is external influencer, (39:17), but also, many of the very valuable makeup artists of M\u2022A\u2022C influence themselves. And being enabled by a lot of great quality asset to support to do this job around the world, and particularly in the U.S. The other thing is, activity in this, is M\u2022A\u2022C is back launching hero products. And as you know, a lot of these media value is driven by exciting new products. For example, Next to Nothing launch, which I mentioned in my prepared remark, is an activity which is creating a lot of conversation in the social media arena, which is helping support the brand. We believe this strength will continue. The M\u2022A\u2022C brand is very active among the various changes they're leading in the U.S. market and internationally in increasing the numbers of hero products that will be passed of their deployed portfolio of innovation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for slotting me in. I just want to turn to margins. Your guidance implies that EBIT margins are going to be down for the full-year modestly. Another three year where you kind of fall short of your longer term targets of 40 basis points to 50 basis points. Can we go through some of the drivers? Like, obviously some deleverage in free standing stores, department stores, et cetera. Talk about the size of those, the path forward? And maybe put a little more teeth on this Leading Beauty Forward program to give us some context of the savings when they can flow? And what it means for margins on the forward? Is this sort of just the new reality that we should get acclimated to service stagnant (41:09) margins? Or is there a path to improve on the forward? Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. With respect to our margins this year, and I think we had indicated this was the case last year as well. One of the things as you all know that we've been experiencing for the last three years is negative currency impact on our margins. So, in fact, if you look at the guidance that you're referring to, Jason, for this year, we have 80 basis points of improvement in margins. That is being offset by a combination of currency as well as our acquisitions. And so we've had a bit of that experience over the last couple of years as we have done a fair number of acquisitions. But most importantly the currency drag on our margin. So, yes, we've had deleverage in free standing stores and that's had an impact. We are offsetting much of that with some of the shifts that we are doing in terms of expansion into specialty-multi, and you'll certainly see more of that impact in fiscal 2018. As it relates to Leading Beauty Forward, when we announced the program about a year ago now, we indicated that the structure of the program is efficiency, effectiveness and redesigning certain organizations to allow us to achieve greater leverage in the future, and leverage implies margin expansion. So, we've delivered 80 basis points of savings from just our cost savings programs this year. Leading Beauty Forward will take another chunk out of our cost base, and also allow us to grow in a more leveraged fashion. And we've got lots of great activity around Leading Beauty Forward. When we announced the program, and certainly still maintain this, we said that we would not see benefit this year. We will start to see some benefit next year, but it will not impact our margin guidance for next year. And then you'll start to see Leading Beauty Forward lead into our margin results over the following few years until it achieves its full potential and that full potential is $200 million to $300 million. We will invest a portion of that back but a portion of that will also be dropped to the bottom line. So it is the reason that we have so much activity around Leading Beauty Forward and, as both Fabrizio and I mentioned, it is actually slightly ahead of plan in terms of some of the initiatives under the program as the organization really rallies behind this to not only create some of these leveraged structures from an organizational standpoint, but also build some of the capability for the future support of our strategic objectives. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. I have a couple of quick follow-on questions on M\u2022A\u2022C. First I just wanted to clarify that it did improve sequentially in the U.S? And then in ULTA, I imagine this will be incremental in the top line. But will it be a drag on your margins given some expected cannibalization of your more profitable M\u2022A\u2022C retail stores? I guess how do you balance that? And then I was curious about a potential halo effect that you might be seeing, broadly speaking, with your new innovation on some of your hero franchises or maybe as you further penetrate new channels, such as specialty-multi with some of your big brands. I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any evidence that Est\u00e9e Lauder customer baskets are increasing? Meaning that your customers are buying more of your portfolio brands and possibly spending more per transaction? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, let me start from this line. I think we said it in prepared remark and everywhere we comment on this new distribution. The new distribution is bringing new customers. And so we have absolute evidence. That's why we have tested our way first with 30 doors, then in certain areas internationally, the same. We have done this very gradually with a lot of attention. And there is \u2013 the large majority of consumers are new to the brands. This is true for new distribution, both online in specialty and this is true for a lot of our new innovation which is focused on segments where we have strategic opportunities or strategic gaps. And that's actually been the big strength. And the other information we \u2013 that I have already shared but I want to further clarify it is that the large majority of these new consumers are millennials. And that's true in all these things that we have. We have year-end data that comport all these learnings and then based on this data, we made decision on distribution evolutions around the world. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: In terms of M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S., no, we think some up and down performance as it relates to M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. So the expectation, obviously, is in the fourth quarter and beyond that the M\u2022A\u2022C performance given certainly the expansion into specialty-multi along with, as Fabrizio said, many of the programs that they're working on and the increase in some of the digital activity that they're doing will start to gradually improve sales in the U.S. And also, as we said, M\u2022A\u2022C is quite strong other than a couple of pockets in international, quite strong in international, particularly in Asia. And again, in addition to some of the expansion into specialty-multi that's being done here in the U.S. and the work that is going on to grow sales in the freestanding store and distribution \u2013 and department store channel, they're also launching in Asia on Tmall. So we expect next year to be a strong year for M\u2022A\u2022C going forward. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And then in term of profit dilution of the new distribution, M\u2022A\u2022C is very dependent from traffic. And so if we \u2013 where we are able to create good sales per door, M\u2022A\u2022C is a profitable brand. And so our priority is to stay focused on really making M\u2022A\u2022C a good brand with great sales per door in every single distribution channel and that will make M\u2022A\u2022C \u2013 will keep M\u2022A\u2022C as a very profitable brand. And in term of the overall dynamic, I want again to clarify the \u2013 M\u2022A\u2022C exposure to, in this moment, the declining brick-and-mortar department store traffic is the key issue we are trying to solve. M\u2022A\u2022C has enormous demand and attention from consumers. It's a very desirable brand. Wherever M\u2022A\u2022C is exposed to traffic, it's performing well. And that's the key issue we are trying to work on. As we said, we have many international pockets where M\u2022A\u2022C is booming. And we need to address the U.S. issue as we have discussed. And I hope you see many of the pivoting activity that we are doing to achieve this goal as fast as possible. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And the only thing I want to add to that is M\u2022A\u2022C is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, brand online in terms of growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to go back to the overall category growth question and answer. So obviously, good quarter sequential improvement but still pretty decently below your large peers in terms of absolute organic growth. So I guess I'm curious to what do you attribute this? How much is Americas? The M\u2022A\u2022C commentary that you've touched on, how much is Clinique as a brand that hasn't been touched on but seems like it declined in the quarter? And then how do you think about improving those trends relative to peers? Or do you think this sort of normalize over time as overall growth moves back towards what you're calling 4% to 5% prestige beauty category growth? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Our growth algorithm is 6% to 8% and we are obviously on this trend. And the key point is this industry is not a zero-sum game. All the big companies are growing. And depending by quarter and by year, some are growing a bit less or a bit more, but we all are growing. So the key point is that there is a strong category growth and there is space to grow for a lot of big companies. And they believe that small brands are diluting the growth of big companies is clearly not demonstrated by the facts, because big companies are growing, are growing their brands and enriching their portfolios. If there are some smaller brands which are doing very well, some of them get acquired by the big companies when they have the right rate of return. And so I believe actually this is an environment where many big companies can grow and can grow at the same time in this amazing part of the industry which is prestige beauty. Now, what do I attribute in the short-term in the last six months, nine months? Our growth be below some of our competitor is frankly 80% U.S. department store traffic. We are the company which has the highest exposure in percentage of our business and in our big brands to U.S. department store traffic. And that's the big thing. And then there are other \u2013 many, many other areas of the world where frankly we are growing faster than many other companies. And the last point I want to make, we are building market share. So in a market we continue to grow 4% to 5%, we continue to grow market share. This was evident also in the recent Unimonitor (52:02) report for 2016 calendar and is obviously proven by these first quarter numbers where we are growing in constant currency 9% versus the market which is probably closer to 4%. So we keep growing market share. We keep growing well in all over the world and we do have an issue to solve \u2013 to address, which is that U.S. department store traffic and our high penetration of this channel. And we are pivoting to reinforce this channel and at the same time diversify our business in the needed way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. First, we obviously talked a fair bit about M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. and the increase in ULTA and Sephora, but one of the things I want to know is how much of their issue for M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. do you think is a function of more competition in the makeup category versus just its retail positioning, particularly with younger consumers that M\u2022A\u2022C has captured for so long. And then perhaps can you give a little bit more detail in terms of what other opportunities are there for other brands in terms of the specialty-multi distribution, not just the smaller faster growing brands, but also the larger ones? And then following up on that, as more activity moves online into smaller format channels, what's the difference in terms of the purchasing patterns versus your traditional retailers? Obviously, the consumer is younger. They are clearly focused a little bit more on the smaller brands versus the larger brands, but what about like product category, price points and things like that? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Okay. So let's start again. M\u2022A\u2022C is \u2013 there've been some recent research issued that M\u2022A\u2022C is the number one brand loved by teenagers in this market in the U.S., and just been published a research on this. All our consumer data showed that M\u2022A\u2022C is among the preferred brands among the millennials and, frankly, all generations. So M\u2022A\u2022C is a business built to be really very sensitive to traffic. And that's the key thing we need to do. The brand is in excellent shape, very desirable. And as I said, to demonstrate this, there are markets around the world where the brand this quarter has been growing 40% or 45%, despite the competition being the same. And so it's a very specific opportunity. Said that, there is definitely a lot of new competition, and every big brand has to face this new competition. On this, I would like to make an \u2013 to do an observation. What we see in the data is that this increasing competition, done by an ever-increasing number of brands, is an increasing competition in the momental (55:06) trial. That is, we don't see increasing competition in the area of loyalty and in the area of retention and repeat, which where the profit is. Let me explain this. We have, for example, in all our big brands, take Est\u00e9e Lauder with Advanced Night Repair, take M\u2022A\u2022C with Studio Fix, the big hero products in this moment are getting more success and increased repeat, despite the increased competition. What is tougher is to get the attention at the trial moment, because of the many small brands , there's more activity out there (55:42). But I would like you to think that the trial moment is not the profitable moment. Trial is an investment. Repeat is a profit. And so at the end, the profitable brands are still the big brands with great hero product, great repeat, and not many small brands that generate a lot of noise on trial, because unless they get the repeat, they will not be sustainable. And so, we are very focused on a sustainable, long-term profitability strategy for our brands, and that's the way we are addressing the issue at M\u2022A\u2022C and the opportunity for all our brands. So, the second question was specialty-multi, which is an opportunity for many of our brands, and I mentioned many of them in my prepared remarks, exactly to give you maximum exposure to all the pivoting we're doing. Instead of repeating them, I would like just to clarify one point. Every brand has a unique distribution strategy in the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company portfolio. So, we don't do things by channel. We do things by brand. So, there are brands which are designed to win well in specialty, brands which are designed to be in multiple channels, and brands that are designed to be more exclusive in a certain channel type. And our broad portfolio brands give us the possibility to play this growing multichannel portfolio globally in an excellent strategic way. The last question was on online, and yes, we see a very different pattern in purchases online. Purchases online tend to be younger and tend to be, frankly, very profitable, because consumers are very loyal when they get into it. There's a lot of good repeat. But most importantly, the online sales allow us to reach consumers that sometimes we cannot reach with brick and mortar. This is particularly true in emerging markets. I just gave the good example of China, where a good launch of M\u2022A\u2022C in Tmall that will happen this quarter, we know, by all our analysis, that will expose millions of Chinese consumers in cities of Tier 3 or Tier 4, that today cannot buy the brand, to be able to buy the brand. This is true for many other brands in our portfolio, and many of our online activities around the world. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So, I wanted to look at your two heritage brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, and Est\u00e9e Lauder looks like it's clearly stabilizing here. There's another quarter of sales growth in both skin care and makeup globally. What are you learning from that? Because on the flipside, it looks like Clinique is still struggling a little bit, both in skin care and in color, not just in the U.S., but it looks like globally as well. So if you could help kind of figure out what could happen to Clinique, and how you're learning from Est\u00e9e? You mentioned some innovation. Is that really going to be the turning point in Clinique? And then second thing, Tracey, maybe more for you, on just more quantification on the drivers you'd mentioned regarding SG&A coming down in the quarter. How much of it was a shift in IT spend from this quarter to next quarter? Was there an ad spend shift perhaps, versus how much of it was kind of more permanent, in terms of actually the improved efficiencies from cost cutting or channel mix? Thanks, guys. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Okay. I'll start from the Lauder and Clinique question, and Tracey will take over. So, first of all, Lauder is growing, so it's not stabilized. Lauder has been growing in a very exciting way, in my opinion, this quarter. And this is the second quarter in a row where the Lauder brand is growing globally. What is driving that is successful innovation that is hitting new consumers, combined with an amazing work on relaunching hero products, and that's the key point. I mean, Double Wear is a fantastic foundation product that millions of consumers around the world love. But still, there are millions of consumer that never tried this product. And so, the ability of the brand to continue win with winning hero products is the key learning, and this is working very well. And, for example, we have learned that Double Wear in specialty-multi attracts Millennials, despite being a foundation that's been there for many years, and being a fantastic product for many years, attract new Millennials to the brand better than maybe specific Millennial launches targeted to Millennial. So we are now ready to leverage these new discoveries on Lauder and continue the acceleration. The third thing which is helping the Lauder brand is that the Lauder brand is more exposed, positively exposed, to the Chinese consumers and to the Asian dynamics than the Clinique brand, for example. The Clinique brand in the country is more exposed to U.S. department store than any other brand in our portfolio together with M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. But globally, Clinique is more exposed in total. So the key point is that Lauder benefited from the comeback of growth in Asia and it being part of one of the brands, driving the comeback of skin care in Asia. And so the research of Asia, Asia skin care is obviously helping the Lauder brand and in our opinion will continue to grow \u2013 to support the growth of the Lauder brand. The learning for Clinique are the same, is more hero products, more activity on innovation that on top of building specific new products, build existing hero products, the Pressed Fresh Vitamin C launch is an example of that. Vitamin C is a new product per se, but at the same time create regimen with existing moisturizer of Clinique and so sell and build hero products and we have tested these successfully in the last year. The art of learning for Clinique is that also Clinique need to accelerate the entrance in growing channels. So also Clinique is further accelerating the expansion in the successful specialty multi-channels where it's playing and online. And so we will continue to do that and, sorry, the last thing on Clinique is the makeup. Clinique is also working to further activate their makeup innovation and activities in fiscal year 2018 that should further boost the brand. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And in terms of the beat this quarter in the margin leverage that we had this quarter, I would say that about 65% of it is a combination of the sales beat as well as the mix of sales. So, favorable channel mix as well as category mix, as Fabrizio was just saying. We did see a pickup in our skin care category and as you all know, that is our most profitable growth category from a margin standpoint. And then the balance of it was some shifts in terms of projects, and as well as A&P spend. So, again, we mentioned there were some of the programs that are launching in Q4 that we are spending behind that were initially thought to launch in Q3. The Cushion Compact would be one of those for Est\u00e9e Lauder in China, and so we are spending behind that in Q4. So that's some of the shifts. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 PM Eastern Time today through May 17.

Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal year 2017 was another successful year for our company. We build momentum in every quarter, pivoted our business through the channels and categories driving global prestige beauty, created exciting new products, reached new consumers, and strengthened our multiple engines of growth. When the year began, we said we expected our sales to accelerate as demands progressed and they did, building each quarter and culminating in an exceptional final quarter and full year. The fourth quarter results came largely from terrific strengths in China, travel retail and online, as well as from many of our brands including our latest acquisitions. In this new fiscal year, we expect our effective strategy to continue to drive our momentum leading to strong sales and profit growth. For the full year, we delivered sales growth of 7%, approximately 2 points ahead of global prestige beauty, enabling us to once again gain share. This is the eighth consecutive year we generated a strong performance and outperformed the industry, demonstrating the sustainability of our strategy despite inevitable external headwinds. This year was marked by greater economic and geopolitical volatility and terrorism, which curtailed demand in several countries. The trend of consumers shifting their shopping preferences by channel accelerated, which resulted in declining traffic in some U.S. brick-and-mortar department stores. At the same time, global competition intensified as new beauty brands and thousands of new products competed for a share of consumer wallets. Despite these challenges, we strengthened our growth engines and created formidable new ones, which was evident in higher sales across our major product categories. Through our seasonal and luxury brands, we have reinvigorated our fragrance category. We also solidified our leadership in the fast-growing makeup category with the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. These exciting brands anchor our portfolio with millennial consumers who often prefer to shop in specialty-multi retailers and online. Central to our success was pivoting our business to capture new consumers. We did this by increasing our exposure to the fastest-growing prestige channels, strengthening our brand portfolio, investing in key geography and enhancing our digital and social media communications. Consumers have a growing emotional attachment for their beauty experience, strong loyalty to product performance, a desire for high-touch service and a preference for experiential channels. These are the pillars of our Company\u2019s success that we will continue to build on. In fiscal 2017, we took decisive steps to gain a more significant presence globally in specialty-multi retailers and increased our penetration by 40%. We have historically been well-represented in specialty-multi internationally, and we reinforced our position with new and existing retailers. In Europe, some of our brands expanded in Sephora and Douglas. In Asia, our brands went into more Sephora stores in China and Southeast Asia and captured new opportunities with the brand-building specialty-multi retailers that are emerging. Clinique was our first brand in Eveandboy in Thailand and in Olive Young in Korea. In the U.S., our high-end La Mer and Jo Malone brands entered Sephora\u2019s flagship stores and began selling on its website, joining many of other brands \u2013 of our brands that are already successful there. In addition, Est\u00e9e Lauder and MAC opened in selected ULTA Beauty stores and on ulta.com, which helped them reach new target consumer, especially in smaller cities. E-commerce continued to be vibrant and our business accelerated, growing 33%, with strong global growth. Our brands opened sites in new countries and with various retailers, planting seeds for future gains. In the fourth quarter, we launched MAC on China popular Tmall, and it was the platform\u2019s largest prestige beauty launch. Our travel retail sales grew more than 20%, generating the best gains in five years due to strong demand for our product and wider availability of our brand portfolio in large productive airports. Passenger traffic grew high single-digits and a resurgence of Chinese tourists helped drive our strong performance. We remain the leader in makeup and skin care combined in travel retail, and our makeup sales soared, which lifted many brands. One of those was Tom Ford. Its travel retail business more than doubled, fueled by Chinese consumer who coveted the brand\u2019s high-end makeup and fragrances. Our brands continue to be highly desirable. Our best performers were many of our mid-size and luxury brands, which grew double-digits and helped fuel our makeup, skin care, and fragrance categories. As an example, La Mer\u2019s success stemmed from driving trial with compelling innovation and repeat purchases with core products. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand returned to solid mid-single digit global growth for the year, delivering gains in both makeup and skin care. It was well positioned to take advantage of the resurgence in China and travel retail and strengthen its Europe franchises with innovative new products. Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, and the Pure Color Envy lipstick lines all grew double-digits. The brand also benefited from effective social media and digital market which led to its top ranking in the L2 China Beauty Index. We strategically invested in key geographies to match success. Countries represented more than one quarter of our sales grew double-digits, including emerging markets of China and Russia as well as developed countries like Italy. We attribute the strong results to locally relevant products and communications and targeted expanded consumer reach. Thanks to a strong economy and growing desire for prestige beauty, demand from Chinese consumer climbed, both in the local market as they travel the world. Our China business accelerated throughout the year, delivering outstanding growth of more than 40% in the fourth quarter and 90% for the year. A record 133 million Chinese tourists traveled last year, as we see this momentum continuing, which should positively impact our business across the globe. Enhancing our social media and digital engagement is a priority across our portfolio. Our brands leveraged a growing number of influencers. And as we grew our experience, we gain share in our media value, ending the year as the number one prestige beauty company in the U.S. according to Tribe Dynamics. The intersection of social media, digital marketing, and e-commerce is integral to our brand strategies and we have a digital first mind-set throughout the company at this point. In fiscal 2017, we continue to direct more advertising dollars to the digital space. Nearly half of our visible A&P spending globally was digital, up significantly from the year before. In other areas, we began implementing several programs under our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We augmented our digit talent, capped expenses, and reinvested in high-growth areas to position us to compete more effectively in the environment that lies ahead. With the prestige beauty landscape shifting rapidly, we are proactively positioning ourselves to capture the new ways consumers are engaging with beauty. To continue to lead and win, we will leverage our company strengths; our broad prestige brand portfolio, superior product quality, creativity, talent, and brand building distribution all across our many geographies. Let me now discuss the focus of our fiscal year 2018 strategy. We will continue to connect our brands to high growth, brand-building channels to align with how and where consumers are shopping. We expect specialty-multi, online, travel retail, and freestanding store will continue their strong growth. Dennis will discuss the online segment shortly. In specialty-multi, we have captured a new consumer by matching our brands with global retailers that are the right fit in collaborating to drive trial, repeat purchase and regimen usage. For example, MAC is opening in Sephora\u2019s top stores in Brazil and we launched in the specialty multi-channel in Asia-Pacific. We are rolling out Too Faced in Sephora in most European markets, including France and, in Douglas, in Germany. In the U.S., La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford will solidify their distribution in Sephora while Est\u00e9e Lauder, MAC and Clinique will extend their presence in ULTA. In addition, Bumble and bumble is launching on ulta.com this weekend followed by 500 ULTA stores. In travel retail, we are building on our strength in skin care, further growing our makeup and fragrance categories. We are introducing some of our newer brands, opening more doors in high traffic airports, developing new store formats, ensuring we have locally relevant product in major travel corridors. We expect the higher passenger traffic coupled with effective marketing to increase conversion, will lead to strong sales growth again this year. We are enhancing the experience of our freestanding stores by adding more open sell environments such as in MAC redesign of its Time Square flagship. MAC will offer different shopping option across its stores, which should strengthen productivity. Throughout our more than 1,400 global freestanding stores, we are adding more omni-channel capabilities to connect them with online. Globally, department stores are an important brand-building channel that provide high-touch service, and we are investing by modernizing our counters in our service model in the best performing doors. Many international department store continue to generate very healthy growth especially those in high traffic touristic destinations like Harrods or Selfridges in London where our business is robust. In several other markets such as China or Italy, department stores are delivering strong gains. Our biggest challenge has been in some U.S. brick-and-mortar department stores, which are struggling from falling foot traffic especially in smaller malls and touristic driven doors. U.S. department store represents approximately 17% of our global sales last year. And we are encouraged by new signs of strength in some retailers\u2019 top doors. We will leverage debt activity by improving our merchandising, our service, our communication, and our sampling and we are also collaborating with U.S. department stores to boost that business online, which is growing strongly. We expect our makeup and fragrance categories to lead our growth. As the global leader in prestige makeup, we are leveraging individual strengths of our many makeup brands to cater to different consumers. We will drive our luxury and our seasonal fragrance portfolio by strengthening the brands we recently acquired and supporting and Jo Malone and Tom Ford excellent momentum. In skin care, our sales improved last year and we anticipate even better growth this year supported by exciting innovation and more robust consumer demand. Looking at our three biggest brands, we expect Est\u00e9e Lauder to, again, deliver solid growth. We also anticipate improvements at MAC, its international business has remained strong. And it plans to open 200 new ULTA stores in the U.S. by fiscal year-end. Clinique has enjoyed good momentum in China and travel retail in recent months in recent response to new launches such as Fresh Pressed Serum with pure vitamin C and we believe its results will also improve. We will continue to reallocate resources and add talents to our social media programs which have become a critical component of beauty marketing. Our brands are aligning with authentic and locally relevant influencers and amplifying their storytelling to ensure that their content is differentiated and memorable. Consumers are purchasing beauty products more frequently than in the past partly because they can quickly and easily order online. This is especially true for our hero products and franchises, which generate more triumph in bringing new consumer as well as repeat business, which is more profitable. We have robust cadence of launches planned with an emphasis on strengthening core franchises. As an example, Est\u00e9e Lauder just introduced Advanced Night Repair eye concentrate matrix which incorporates innovative technology and has been well received. It also launched a new formula of its best-selling Double Wear foundation, which is a top recruiting product in many markets, attracting both millennials and ageless consumers. Foundations are a large and high loyalty subcategory and many other brands like Clinique are introducing new formulas. It\u2019s Even Better glow makeup is off to a strong start. MAC Next to Nothing lightweight foundation is a departure from the brand\u2019s full coverage makeups and should continue to be a strong recruitment product this year. In skin care, La Mer is rolling out two new types of moisturizer to support its iconic Cr\u00e8me de La Mer product lineup including a lotion with a matte finish and we expect a strong consumer response. Clinique launched Fresh Pressed serum and a supercharged version of Moisture Surge a few months ago, each to terrific perception and they should continue to be a major sales driver for the brand this year. To gain insight and help drive decisions across innovation, social media, and marketing, we are using much more analytics. We expect our investment in advertising to increase and comprise a greater percent of sales with digital media, the fastest growing outlet. We will advance more programs and the Leading Beauty Forward, allowing us to drive further efficiency, provide more fuel, reallocate resources to high growth area in advertising and better leverage sales growth. In closing, we are extremely proud of our performance in fiscal 2017. I want to thank our global employees and my executive team for their leadership and ability to effectively execute change across the organization, which is an important competitive advantage for our company. We are fortunate to operate in a highly desirable industry they are focused on the many opportunities in our future. We are confident in our ability to win. We will achieve our goals by leveraging our successful strategy that is based on multiple engine of growth, a well-diversified business, superior talent and creativity and unmatched product quality and branding. As we have shown this past year, we are executing our change agenda with excellence and speed. As we drive our momentum, we will continue to embrace a changing landscape, push the boundaries of possibility and pivot to tomorrow\u2019s opportunity as consumer preferences evolve. As I mentioned, we are instilling a digital-first mind-set throughout our company. And now Dennis McEniry who has led our online business for the past 17 years will discuss this exciting area. Dennis? Dennis McEniry : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. We created our dedicated online division almost 20 years ago, and today encompasses a global team of nearly 700 people, working on hundreds of direct-to-consumer and retailer sites across 39 countries. We are responsible for building and operating our direct-to-consumer A&M commerce sites partnering with retailers to fuel their growing online businesses as well as spearheading digital technology, innovation and omni-channel initiatives. The online division has historically grown sales at an average annual rate of about 25% and is margin accretive to the company. In fiscal 2017, online sales accelerated, growing 33% to $1.3 billion globally. Many of our brands, in particular Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, MAC and Tom Ford, had an outstanding year online. Too Faced, a recently acquired brand, more than doubled its online sales when viewed on a 12-month comparable basis. And our top four online markets, e-commerce represents approximately 20% of our sales. Globally online represents 11% of total company sales, up from 4% just five years ago. We continue to outperform total online retail growth in the U.S. and in the UK, our two largest online markets. In China, our third largest market, we nearly doubled online sales and we\u2019re again the top prestige beauty company on Tmall for Singles\u2019 Day. We are also nearly doubled our online sales in other emerging markets such as Russia, Turkey, South Africa and we launched in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and India. Our fiscal 2017 online growth was fueled by both direct-to-consumer and retailer sites, which account for approximately 60% and 40% of our online business respectively. We launched over 45 direct-to-consumer sites on our own platform and third-party platforms such as Tmall. Our signature High-Touch services that are available online set us apart from our competitors. We combine real-life beauty experts who have extensive knowledge about our products with technology to deliver the best beauty advice online. We also work with artificial intelligence and other technologies in order to deliver a more unique, interactive, personalized tool such as virtual try-on of makeup technology, using augmented reality and facial recognition technology, as well as a botspowered foundation finder tool. On retailer sites, we saw strong online growth from a number of customers, including Sephora, Selfridges and Douglas. Many of our brands, in particular Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and MAC, had an outstanding year on macys.com. We also successfully launched Est\u00e9e Lauder, Origins and MAC on ULTA.com and Jo Malone and La Mer on sephora.com. We are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities by linking our online platform to our freestanding store and support our newly launched loyalty programs. With MAC Select, Est\u00e9e E-List and My Origins Rewards our consumers are spending more across channels and more frequently, improving our consumer retention rate and driving higher consumer lifetime value. Mobile commerce continues to drive our results, as it provides consumers with always-connected and always-on commerce. Mobile accounts for two-thirds of our traffic and nearly half of our online sales. We anticipate this trend to accelerate, so we are expanding our mobile team and increasing investments in mobile innovation to provide the best beauty experience. We are working to tie our social media efforts to m-commerce sales with the best High-Touch beauty experts in the industry. This branded beauty experience brings our brands to life in a way that is personalized, locally relevant and fun, all delivered to her mobile device 24/7. The online team has a strong track record of delivering consistent double-digit top-line growth and margin accretive profit growth to the company, while navigating a rapidly-changing online environment. Looking forward, we are confident of our proven capabilities positioning us well against our competitors to drive continuous sustainable growth. We have built a strong e-commerce foundation with a global team located in 39 countries, which makes us highly competitive. Our model gives us a solid platform to deploy more brands in more countries with more products and categories in the future, which will enable us to garner new consumers around the world. We are strategically focused on expanding our brand-building distribution online across both direct-to-consumer and retailer sites. Opportunities exist in capitalizing on industry growth as more consumers shift online, adding new brands in our existing markets, expanding our online platform to the countries we are not currently in. For example, we plan to expand our online presence in India, Middle East and Southeast Asia this year. A number of our brands, including Jo Malone and La Mer, have many untapped markets to enter. We also have attractive online expansion opportunities from recent acquisitions, including GLAMGLOW, Too Faced, Le Labo and BECCA. Our strategy also includes a focus on category opportunities. Fragrance is our fastest-growing category, and currently accounts for less than 10% of our online sales. With untapped potential, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, we expect our fragrance brands to drive significant online growth over the next three years. Our growth opportunities will also be fueled by technology improvements, innovation and advanced data analytics. We are investing capital and resources in key areas including Mobile, omni-channel, digital innovation and marketing technology. To ensure online remains a key engine of growth for the company, we are committed to further developing and building our talent. We have trained over 2,500 people in digital this past year across the company, and the digital and online area has the fastest growth in terms of people head count. Our online team, which is tightly integrated with our brands through close collaborations, consists of 80% women, 60% millennials and 39% Gen X. It is our priority to foster a team culture that promotes diversity, learning and strong collaboration in order to drive success in a fast-paced environment. In closing, I want to thank my amazing team for strategic thinking and tireless execution. I also want to thank my colleagues in the company, and our retailers worldwide for their continued support. Now Tracey will review the company\u2019s financials. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results, and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2018 first quarter and full year as well as our three year target. My commentary today excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments including Leading Beauty Forward charges, impairment of intangible, adjustments to contingent considerations and the China tax adjustment, which are all disclosed in our press release this morning. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.89 billion, up 11% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 3.5 points of this growth. Our business in the Asia-Pacific region led our growth this quarter, with sales up 18% in constant currency, driven primarily by accelerated momentum in China. Sales in China rose more than 40%, as you heard Fabrizio mention, with broad-based growth across brands and channels. All of our brands grew double or triple digits in China this quarter, and our online business more than doubled. Hong Kong continued its rebound with high single-digit growth ending more than two years of declining sales. We also achieved solid sales growth in Japan, Korea and Indonesia. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales rose 12% in constant currency, led by a 20% increase in global travel retail. The outstanding growth in the travel retail channel reflects a 9% rise in international passenger traffic and buoyant retail in areas of historical strength for us; notably Hong Kong, Macau and the UK. The strong performance across most of our brand portfolio; in particular Tom Ford, Jo Malone, La Mer, MAC and Est\u00e9e Lauder was driven by new launch activity and targeted expansion in high-performing airports to reach new consumers. The EMEA region also benefited from double-digit sales growth in many markets, including Italy, France, the Nordic countries and Greece. The UK and Spain also grew low to mid single-digits. In the region\u2019s emerging markets, the Middle East grew strongly as it lapped the downturn that began last March and began to slowly replenish stock. Overall, retail continues to be consistent with the economic situation in the region. Russia was flat, but other Eastern European markets and India rose double digits. Net sales in the Americas grew 6% in constant currency. Latin America sales rose 20%, led by double-digit increases in Argentina, Chile, Peru; Mexico and Brazil rose high single digits. Sales in North America rose 5% due to the addition of our newest brands Too Faced and BECCA. Excluding the acquisitions, North American sales declined 3% due to continued softness in the brick-and-mortar business of department stores and, to a lesser extent, freestanding stores. Our net sales in online and specialty-multi channels rose double digits. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 170 basis points from the prior year period, due primarily to adverse product mix, including the impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisitions and the associated inventory step-up. Obsolescence and currency also contributed to the margin decline, while pricing partially offset the decreases. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 250 basis points, primarily due to lower selling expenses that reflected our changing channel mix, along with prudent expense management. These improvements were partially offset by higher advertising, R&D and store operating costs. As a result, operating income rose 20% and operating margin increased 80 basis points. Diluted EPS of $0.51 was 21% above the prior year and grew 25% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the outstanding results delivered by our travel retail and China businesses, stronger growth in skin care and overall disciplined expense management. Now let me cover a few highlights of our full year results. Net sales grew 7% in constant currency. Incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions contributed approximately 2 percentage points of that growth. Our gross margin decreased 110 basis points. Supply chain efficiencies and pricing were more than offset by the mix of higher-cost new products, the impact of acquisitions including the inventory step-up, higher obsolescence and adverse currency. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 140 basis points primarily due to lower selling expenses and prudent expense management. These improvements were partially offset by higher store operations costs, stock compensation and shipping expense. Our full year operating margin rose 30 basis points to 15.9%. This margin included 70 basis points of unfavorability comprised of 50 basis points of dilution from the recent acquisitions and 20 basis points from currency translation. We improved our expense leverage of sales growth, and our cost saving programs contributed more than $200 million in savings this year. Net interest expense rose to $75 million from $55 million in the prior year reflecting our increased debt level partially offset by higher investment income. Net earnings grew 7% to $1.3 billion, and diluted EPS rose 8% to $3.47. Earnings per share included $0.12 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.08 of dilution from acquisitions. At constant exchange rates, EPS grew 11% for the year. In fiscal 2017, we recorded approximately $143 million after tax in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We\u2019ve begun establishing more efficient structures in certain areas of the company, including some of our regional organizations and corporate functions and redesigned our procurement organization to generate further savings opportunities in several areas of spend. Additionally, we realized a $21 million net after-tax gain for adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration and impairments of intangibles relating to some of our 2015 acquisitions. Lastly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change in the tax law in China expanded the corporate income tax deduction limitation for advertising and promotional expenses. As a result, the company released into income its previously established deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately $75 million related to its accumulated carry forward of excess advertising and promotion expenses. In fiscal 2017, we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations, representing a slight improvement over the prior year. Excluding the cash costs of Leading Beauty Forward, cash from operations increased 7%. We utilized cash generated as well as $1.5 billion in new debt to repay $300 million in senior notes that came due in May to acquire Too Faced and BECCA and to make a minority investment in DECIEM, a multi-brand beauty company. We also spent $504 million on capital improvements primarily for retail stores, e-commerce support and counters. We continue to return cash to shareholders, repurchasing 4.7 million shares of our stock for $413 million and paying $486 million in dividends. We increased our dividend rate by 13%, the eighth consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases. Overall, the 7% sales growth and 11% EPS increase in constant currency we delivered in fiscal 2017 is in line with our long-term goals. Our increased balance and diversification by geography, channel and brand helped us to sustain growth above the industry and deliver our profit objectives. Looking ahead, we expect global prestige beauty to continue to rise 4% to 5% annually, barring any significant economic downturn. Our goal is to grow at least 1 point to 2 points ahead of the industry by continuing to balance our distribution with higher-growth channels and markets and at least generate 1% of that sales growth from acquisitions over the next three years. We continue to pursue efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do so we can both reinvest into our key strategic growth drivers, especially consumer-facing activities, and achieve our financial objectives. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is well on-track and expected to deliver $200 million to $300 million in annual net savings by 2021, as we told you previously. Through the redesign of certain areas of our company, the program has already enabled us to accelerate the changes we needed to support stronger digital consumer engagement, enable greater cost leverage and more aggressively reallocate resources into stronger growth drivers. The Leading Beauty Forward program combined with our ongoing cost management efforts allow us to support continued strong top line growth and to target average annual margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points and double-digit EPS growth over the next three years. Over the next three years, we will also continue to pursue working capital improvement to free up cash. In fiscal 2017, our inventory days to sell increased by 12 to 201 due largely to the new acquisitions and we did not achieve the improvement we expected. And while higher sales growth in certain fast-growing regions and channels next year could create higher inventory in our distribution networks, we have developed more robust action plans to drive improvement in slower-moving SKUs and the acquisition impact should diminish. We now aim to reach approximately 150 inventory days to sell by the end of fiscal 2020. For now let\u2019s take a look at our expectations for fiscal 2018 full year and first quarter. For the year, sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency with contributions from all regions and product categories. We expect growth to be led by many of the same drivers we saw accelerate over the past year, travel retail and China, which are expected to drive improved momentum in skin care, the makeup and fragrance categories and the online and specialty-multi channels. Additionally, Too Faced and BECCA will contribute higher incremental sales through the first half of the fiscal year until they lap their acquisition dates in the latter part of the second quarter. For the full year, they are expected to contribute approximately 2 percentage points to our overall sales growth. Aside from these strong growth areas of the business, we are also expecting some improved momentum in our large brands. Currency translation is finally expected to be favorable in fiscal 2018 following several years of a strong dollar depressing our result. Based on August 1 spot rates of 1.14 for the euro, 1.30 for the pound and 112 for the yen, we expect currency translation to benefit reported sales for the full fiscal year by about 1 percentage point. We continue to achieve cost savings through indirect procurement, A&P effectiveness and demo selling within our ongoing programs and we expect to see initial net benefits from Leading Beauty Forward as overhead savings are expected to modestly outweigh reinvestment this year. Some of the savings will be reinvested in digital marketing and advertising, supporting increased activity for many of our brands. Leading Beauty Forward provides us with the flexibility to invest more in advertising globally and also support consumer-facing IT and brand expansion in fast growing channels. And our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27%. The impact of the new accounting pronouncement for stock-based compensation is not included in our estimates at this time. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.87 and $3.94 before restructuring charges and other adjustments, including approximately $0.09 of accretion from currency translation and $0.01 accretion from the fiscal 2017 acquisition. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 11%. In fiscal 2018, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% compared with last year. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $600 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales, primarily to support counters, gondolas, stores and e-commerce, general infrastructure needs in our supply chain and new technology to enable our digital-first and analytical efforts along with the Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Our sales in the first quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10%. Key drivers include approximately 4 percentage points of incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA, expanded consumer reach for many brands particularly in specialty-multi, online and in our international freestanding stores, continued momentum in China, online, travel retail and some European markets like Italy and Russia. In the U.S., we expect a continued challenging brick-and-mortar environment in certain channels. We expect first quarter EPS of between $0.94 and $0.97, growth of 12% to 15%, including dilution of about $0.01 from acquisitions. Currency translation is forecasted to be neutral to both sales and EPS in the first quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our results over the past year and the momentum we gained on our strategic objectives. Given the rapidly changing world of global prestige beauty and the dynamic macro environment we operate in, we are thrilled to be creating additional momentum for the future by accelerating the execution of our strategies while delivering strong results. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] To ensure everyone has the opportunity to ask their questions, we will limit each person to one question. Time permitting, we will return to you for additional question [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning. So Tracey, first I just wanted to follow up on the margins. You mentioned 50 basis points per annum for the next three years. But just putting in the guidance for fiscal 2018, it looks like margins are expected to be flat for 2018. So one, is that right? And could you just expand sort of the reasons for why that is the case? Tracey Travis : So on a constant currency basis, we expect that margins will improve about 30 to 50 basis points in fiscal 2018. What I said, Faiza, was that on average we expect to deliver about 50 basis points over the next three years. So that could be 30 basis points one year and it could be 70 basis points another year. But the average we expect to achieve over a three-year time horizon is 50 basis points. And obviously that will depend on where our sales growth ranges. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. Actually, I have two, sorry. One is, can you talk a little bit more about just the cadence of growth between the first half and the second half of 2018, given BECCA and Too Faced acquisition timing? Are you including any acquisitions in the guidance? And especially kind of your \u2013 curious about your view on the Americas because ex BECCA and Too Faced at 3.5% for the company, for the quarter is down 2% or 3%. So just kind of cadence of how you roll off successfully those acquisitions. And second, I want to just take advantage, Dennis, of you being on the call. For a while, we\u2019ve asked about Amazon, how that fits into your online strategy. And it sounds like we\u2019re continuing to say that Amazon is not part of the strategy at this point. But my concern obviously is that \u2013 and I think many people\u2019s concern is that you might be essentially advocating your brand and price management on Amazon to third parties who are selling your products \u2013 you might not be selling but Est\u00e9e Lauder can be bought on Amazon. So what would you have to see from Amazon to decide to sell there? Thanks for taking the two. Tracey Travis : So let me start with the acquisitions and Fabrizio might add on to this. But we called out obviously that they will contribute 4% in the first quarter and again, we\u2019re speaking about Too Faced and BECCA. Different lines or different product lines of ours have somewhat different seasonal cadence in terms of their growth algorithm. So, and for the full year, they will contribute 2%. So we acquired Too Faced and BECCA in the November-December timeframe of last year. And so certainly in the second half, we would expect for total company our growth to moderate about a point or two from the first half due to the fact that we will have Too Faced and BECCA in our sales growth numbers from prior year. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And on the contour of the cadence, in fact, the activity also \u2013 the base of the second six months would be stronger than the base of the first six months. As you remember, we had the first quarter last year at plus 2%, 3%. And so that\u2019s the other factor that we would need to expect. So in our estimate, we do expect a stronger top line in the first six months from the second six months. But we expect also very strong and solid second six months and as we said, a 7% to 8% for the year. On the second question, on your question on Amazon, I mean, we distribute into brand-building distribution, which exercise the key drivers of our prestige beauty including High-Touch services. And so we are ready to distribute in channels where those criterias are fully respected. We do distribute in some global e-commerce platforms like Tmall where those criterias are respected. At this point we do not distribute in Amazon, and in our fiscal year 2018 plan and estimates, there is no distribution in Amazon included. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. I was actually hoping you guys could comment on any effects you might have seen from department stores such as Macy\u2019s rolling out discounts on cosmetics. First, have you seen a lift in your sales from this? And then second, what is your view on this strategy? And how have you been working with some of your retail partners as they\u2019re facing headwinds? Fabrizio, you touched on this a bit, but I was hoping you could drill down a little further on some of the strategies that are being implemented to offset the weak foot traffic. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, no, absolutely, no. We are really strongly collaborating with our partners in department store to increase traffic. And I mentioned that \u2013 but I mentioned merchandising. We are relooking at merchandising activity and we are relooking at our counters, at our system of engagements in store, and we are making some progress, in my opinion. But obviously most importantly is the way innovation gets executed, and the way social media gets executed on the innovation is also an important element to contribute to traffic building again. The third big factor, we are working very aggressively with our partners with online. And they\u2019re making excellent progress online, and we are making on our business very good progress on e-commerce with them as well, and that\u2019s also important. The other important thing that e-commerce is increasing the frequency of purchase of our consumers because their repurchase is readily available, and sometimes in the past, people would have waited to repurchase their regular preferred product to the next visit. Now they don\u2019t need to wait. So basically all the gaps of people in usage or repeated usage of product are being filled by the user online. That\u2019s also very true also in the department store channel, and we are leveraging this reality. We are seeing some initial progress in the strong doors, and as I said in my prepared remark, the problem remains in the smaller malls where traffic for the moment is not yet strong. But I\u2019m optimistic that we may see \u2013 we may have in front of us a moment of improvement in this area in fiscal year 2018. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks, and morning, everybody. Maybe just a follow-up and then another question. So just back to the Amazon question, would it be fair to look at it sort of a different way and say you may be more willing to put select brands like Clinique, which has struggled a little bit in North America, on a platform like Amazon that potentially helps to get the brand to more consumers? I guess, what would be your thoughts on that? And then just more broadly, on Asia-Pacific, so obviously really strong growth. I\u2019m curious if you could quantify if possible the benefit from geopolitical issues between China and Korea, for example that has contributed just to the overall category accelerating in terms of the results from yours and some of your large competitors, and thoughts on the sustainability of 40% type growth in China? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. So on the first question, as I said, all of our brand \u2013 our company is 100% focused on prestige luxury beauty, meaning that all of our brands without exception are distributed in brand-building distribution proven to have all the driver of prestige. So there will not be exception for brands like \u2013 any brand. And Clinique, by the way, is very much a key prestige brand in our portfolio. On Asia, yes, 40% is a big number, so I\u2019m not going to say 40% is sustainable. But a double-digit continuous growth in this moment looks very sustainable because there are several dynamics that are playing in the China situation. First of all, the growth in China is depending a lot from the lower import duty that\u2019s been passed on to pricing into the local product. This has pushed the market. Then the second big dynamic is that the Chinese consumers are passionate about makeup and fragrances more and more. So China historically was really driven by skincare. Today, China is driven by three engines, two of which on a very dynamic growth. So this is proven by our retail growth in quarter four, where we had for example some brands like MAC that just doubled the business in one quarter now, obviously helped by the team who launched. But still, the growth in the same-door brick-and-mortar was outstanding, and the same for our Bobbi Brown and the same for our Est\u00e9e Lauder makeup, where historically Est\u00e9e Lauder was very successful on skincare only is now adding a very important leg in makeup. This phenomenon is going to continue, in our opinion, and that\u2019s why it would be sustainable. Third point in China, we see growth from department store, from Sephora, from freestanding store, from online; it\u2019s really across and it\u2019s across all the cities. We are in 170 cities. When we look at our online sales, where the purchases come from, an enormous amount of these purchases come from cities we do not operate in brick-and-mortar, which makes the distribution in China efficient, but also the opportunity to grow new consumers come from cities where we do not operate today. And then finally, the portfolio fragrance is going to get traction for the industry and for us, particularly Jo Malone and Tom Ford at this point. So I believe there is a lot of traction and a lot of fundamentals in China in this moment which is very strong. Now, you asked about Korean brands. Yes, in this moment Korean brands in China are weaker than usual and this may not be the sustainable part of the story. But that\u2019s why I wanted first to explain the sustainable part of the story because I believe that even when the Korea brands demand had to stabilize, I think we will continue to see good traction in China. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just had a question on Asia, in particular, from an operating income perspective. Tracey, could you just speak to some of the drivers in the quarter that led to that slide in profitability? And then as you go into fiscal 2018, what\u2019s assumed in profitability of this region? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So in the fourth quarter, one of the things that we saw was great new product launch from some of our brands. So the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, as Fabrizio mentioned in his prepared remarks, launched their double-wear cushion compact. There were new launches against Nutritious. MAC had their \u2013 the launch of Tmall, so we had a fair amount of advertising investment in the fourth quarter to support new product launch activity in China and in some other markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific region is a strong and profitable region for us. And to the extent that we had new product launches, and certainly you\u2019ve seen this from us in the past, one of the ways that we, given our new product launch cadence, one of the ways that we certainly start the year strong is by investing at the end of the year against momentum launches that we see. The other new product that we expect to support in Asia-Pacific this year is the Fresh Pressed launch from Clinique, which also has had tremendously strong momentum. And we expect that to continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Russ Miller : Hey. Good morning. This is Russ Miller on for Nick. Fabrizio Freda : Hi. Russ Miller : I just wanted to ask on the MAC U.S. business. Can you provide any more details of the state of business there? Is MAC U.S. meeting your expectations, and what are the plans to further improve the business moving forward? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. MAC U.S. is improving, that has still been declining in the last quarter. So our expectation is that the brand will improve by better innovation, stronger social media, improvement in store and obviously activities, which are about the assortment and the marketing plans of the brand, which are in evolution to better match the consumer expectation and the consumer evolution. And also the distribution, MAC is still very much exposed in the U.S. to the foot traffic of brick-and-mortar department stores. And so this will be for some time. And so we will \u2013 we are working to improve MAC trend in the U.S. as well. But for the moment, we are assuming that MAC in the U.S. will get the majority of the improvement from the marketing I said and from the ULTA distribution that I quoted in my prepared remarks. The rest of the benefit will come from the international business. Most importantly, I want to underline that MAC online in the U.S., as was explained in the prepared remark of Dennis, grew 29% last year and we are expecting this to continue. So in summary, better marketing, better in-store activities, more social media, ULTA distributions, strong online are the positives that should create the improvements of MAC And we are for the moment not assuming an enormous improvement in the brick-and-mortar department store part in our estimates but we are working on it actively. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. It\u2019s [indiscernible] on for Andrea today. Just want to dive in a little bit more in the skin care business. Can you talk a little bit more about the accelerators, other drivers of acceleration there with skin care being less strong more recently than historically? Are you seeing a pickup in the underlying market that\u2019s helping to grow the acceleration? And how are you thinking about that market going forward within your expectations for the 4% to 5% growth globally? Tracey Travis : So, skin care has been picking up and certainly very strongly in the fourth quarter and we do have higher expectations. Some higher expectations for skin care growth this year than we\u2019ve seen certainly in the last couple of years. And there are a few things driving it. The first I would say is strong innovation. So Clinique, La Mer, Est\u00e9e Lauder, all have strong innovation programs that they\u2019ve launched and products that they\u2019ve launched in fiscal 2017 that we expect to carry into fiscal 2018 along with new innovation that they have planned. The other driver is obviously the momentum that we\u2019re seeing with Chinese traveling consumers. Both in China as well as in the travel quarters and that is driving a lot of skin care growth and consumption as well in various channels of business. We\u2019re also seeing a bit of a pickup in Russian travelers as well which helps our skin care business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi. A few questions for Dennis. First, just detail-wise, can you give us a sense for e-commerce profitability relative to the rest of the Est\u00e9e organization? And then within e-commerce the difference in margins between DTC versus your partner business? And then the broader question is, and this will build on from the earlier questions, but conceptually there are a number of online retailers, some fairly sizable that have this open architecture beauty assortments and not just premium brands but mass brands also. Can you give us more insight on how you decide which online retailers you\u2019re willing to partner with or not given your prestige positioning? And if they\u2019re large e-tailers you\u2019re not exposed to, does that create risk longer term from a market share perspective? And then within the e-commerce sites you\u2019re at, how do you protect the prestige positioning given obviously ordering off a website is very different than purchasing a product at a department store. So how do you kind of manage to keep the prestige positioning within e-commerce? Thanks. Dennis McEniry : Okay. Let me address a lot of that. First of all, the margin is accretive to the company in total. It\u2019s accretive across our own sites and our direct-to-consumer businesses and it\u2019s accretive in our retailer business as well. So all of the components of the business is accretive to the company. Obviously, it varies by business around the world. We operate over 700 sites around the world. So, depending on how long the site has been launched and what sort of scale we have in that particular business or that brand in that country. But we\u2019re really, really happy with the profit accretion of the channel. That\u2019s number one. In terms of the amount of retailers we work with, we work with over 200 retailers around the world. I personally spend a lot of time with department store CEOs, with the heads of e-commerce businesses in different markets around the world. And frankly the number one consideration in which ones that we focus our effort on are two things : where is the consumer going? And secondly, what is their ability to help build our brands and to build our brand equity? Okay. In terms of prestige, we focus a lot on building the beauty expertise of what consumers expect in historically in the real world or in the brick-and-mortar world and we bring that expertise online by marrying both real people with real expertise and technology to help them provide really, really outstanding makeup, skin care, fragrance advice online. So we do not believe that it is all about putting up a website and letting people order and then processing packages. The expertise and the people part of it is as important to our brands and to our prestige positioning as anything else that we do on the technology side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. First in terms of just back to the U.S. and promotions, I mean how do you \u2013 obviously, a lot of that is being funded by the retailer at this point but how do you protect against a potential that the end consumer starts to get used to accepting discounts or delays purchases waiting for a deal, which does ultimately impact the health of the category for you guys? And then on margins specifically for fiscal 2018, I guess I\u2019d like to better understand what kind of benefits you expect from Leading Beauty Forward for this year because you had said that you expect the benefits to outweigh the reinvestment. But 30 to 50 basis points sounds a bit light though obviously to your 50 basis point annual expectation, especially given that FX is turning from a tailwind into \u2013 from a headwind into a tailwind and the hit from M&A should lap as the year progresses. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. I\u2019ll start with \u2013 to say your question is if the consumer will get accustomed to promotion. I mean, they are \u2013 consumers are segmented, and there are certain consumers that do wait for promotional opportunities to buy and this is not new. This has always been the case. And there are other consumers that don\u2019t. But on average, I just want to make you think that the growing part of the business is the non-promoted one. And the growing \u2013 the fastest-growing channels are the channels that promote the least. And so in total, I would say that prestige beauty is from a consumer standpoint is an industry that need a moderate amount of promotions. And then where there are excessive promotions is a short-term event that generally doesn\u2019t generate a change in consumer behaviors. And then I think Tracey will address Leading Beauty Forward. Tracey Travis : Yes. So Leading Beauty Forward, when we announced the program last year, one of the things that we said was fiscal 2018, we would start to see some of the benefits of the program. We expected that we would reinvest those benefits back in talent in some areas and capabilities. So we talked a lot in our prepared remarks about the digital technology and skill sets that we are enabling in the company that are important for us to drive our \u2013 the growth of our brands, certainly, in fiscal 2018 and beyond. So net-net, we are not seeing a flow-through of any of those benefits of Leading Beauty Forward because we are reinvesting them in fiscal 2018. You will start to see more of a flow-through in future years, in 2019 and 2020, and obviously the full benefits of the program in fiscal 2020, 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So, I also wanted to touch on the U.S. prestige category. So, clearly, we\u2019re seeing more discounting from the department store channel. So, I was just curious from your perspective, has anything changed for the category fundamentals? And as you look at your results recently, have the growth rates \u2013 I guess maybe not your results, but within the industry at all changed in prestige beauty the past few months? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So I\u2019m not sure I understand completely the question. But no, we don\u2019t see any change in the dynamic of the industry. Actually, let me take the opportunity to explain one important thing. Obviously, the industry is based on trial and repurchase. What the change of the last few years is that the trial activity has become more competitive. There are more brands that have been in some cases promotions, they\u2019ve been more active. And so, the world of trial has become more competitive. But the world of trial tends to be an investment. The world of repurchase, loyalty, actually has not changed a lot. The loyalty level on our brands are improving in some cases, stable in others. The repurchase rate remains very high for our hero SKUs. So, what\u2019s happening is that the repurchase is still driven by product quality and by product performance and by brand loyalty. And those things are not changing much less. Now, it happened that the majority of the profitability is in the repurchase gain. And so, the brands and the companies that own the repurchase gain are owning more of the profit and more of the cash. And the trial gain which is becoming more competitive is what we are all reacting to, improving our social media activation, our innovation, our activation in-store and all the rest. Promotion is only one element of how this is evolving and, frankly, not the biggest one in my opinion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, everyone else have done two things, I\u2019m going to go with two things. First is just on Clinique. So, one was just performance in the quarter, but more specifically, I was curious if you could parse out Clinique performance in the channels where there\u2019s traffic. So, whether it\u2019s specialty-multi, also specifically online, things like that. And anything you \u2013 whether you feel like there are green shoots or examples of where Clinique is improving outside of the Fresh Pressed or if the brand still kind of needs a bit more love and attention. MAC freestanding stores, I don\u2019t think we got an update there on the U.S. performance. I know you talked about brick-and-mortar challenges ongoing. And then the final thing was on SMI. Tracey, I think you said that the savings were over $200 million this year. I believe the guidance was $150 million. So, I just want to confirm that SMI came in above plan and if you\u2019re willing to share anything on the outlook for 2018. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : So, on stats and then Tracey, you take SMI. So, on Clinique. Clinique is growing in Asia. Clinique is growing in Europe. Clinique is growing in Latin America. I\u2019ll ask Dennis in a second to speak about Clinique online. Fresh Pressed has been a success. There are several aspect in the Clinique business which is growing. Clinique in brick-and-mortar U.S. department store is declining. And since this is still an important part of Clinique business, obviously, this is offsetting some of the positive moments. Sorry, then you asked about specialty, Clinique is growing in specialty in the U.S. Dennis, on online? Dennis McEniry : So, Clinique in \u2013 first of all online Clinique is our second biggest business. It\u2019s been the first business and the first brand that we ever launched in the company and it is growing over 23% globally. So, it\u2019s very strong for us. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And then on MAC again, as I said before, I already answered the question on what type of positive signs from MAC which is, MAC international and MAC online, ULTA, MAC in the U.S., the improvements in MAC marketing activity, et cetera. But yes, the two areas of MAC which are still taking the brand down are brick-and-mortar brand store and freestanding store U.S. But freestanding store outside of the U.S. keep growing profitably. So, those are the two areas where we are working to further turn around the MAC However, to be clear, the expectation in fiscal year 2018 is MAC to grow because between the positive and these two areas still to be fixed, the positive are much bigger than these two areas still to be fixed. And then on SMI? Tracey Travis : So, you\u2019re right, Lauren, on SMI. We did deliver over $200 million in terms of savings this year and we did expect $150 million. So, we were able to drive additional cost saving programs in certain areas. Next year, we\u2019re expecting around the $150 million to $200 million savings as well. Some of the programs under SMI are dwindling a bit in terms of the opportunity. Some of the actions and programs under Leading Beauty Forward allows us to reignite some of those areas. Indirect procurement would be one of those areas where we managed to get a fair amount of lower hanging fruit in the last two years. We\u2019ve expanded the number of categories now that we are focused on with standing up a new organization. And that should allow us to continue to drive savings in that particular area. So, the classification in total, both in terms of our ongoing cost saving programs and what Leading Beauty Forward is enabling, we expect to have continuous improvement in not just annual cost savings but certainly the leverage of the company as our sales grow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Tracey Travis : Good morning. Fabrizio Freda : Morning. Jason English : Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to come back to margins as well. Congratulations on the 100 bps of underlying margin growth you achieved last year. But it has gotten you to a point where you\u2019re kind of roughly parity with where you were in calendar 2013, so, kind of hovering around at 15.9%. Now, I know there\u2019s been a number of extraneous factors in the battered margins are proven to be headwinds last couple years you tried to overcome. But many of those issues sound like they\u2019re dissipating, right? FX, no longer the same headwind. Skin care acceleration through the year, you\u2019re talking about more acceleration next year. A number of times throughout the call, you touched on the channel shift and acknowledged that much of that channel shift is margin accretive. And you\u2019ve got Leading Beauty Forward coming at the same time. So, why couldn\u2019t there be a bit of a catch-up here after the stagnation for a number of years? And is there conservatism kind of embedded in maybe the average 50 bps of expansion over the next few years? Or are there other offsets that we need to be contemplating whether they\u2019d be in the form of how the business is changing, shifting, cost to compete reinvestments, et cetera? Can you help me understand that? Tracey Travis : Sure, Jason. So, in terms of over the next three years, you\u2019re absolutely correct that we should \u2013 I mean, hopefully, and the macro environment is quite volatile. But as we see currency now becoming more favorable, if currency rates are better than what we have anticipated and reflected in our guidance, there will be upside related to margin. And we certainly would hope to recover some of the margin that we\u2019ve lost from some of the currency hits that we\u2019ve taken over the last few years. In terms of the acquisitions, yes, our acquisitions, if they actually outperform what we have anticipated then that too will allow us greater margin expansion. Right now as you heard, we\u2019re expecting about $0.01 of impact from Too Faced and BECCA. If they perform better this year, that will improve our margins as well. And then Leading Beauty Forward, to the extent that some of those savings get realized earlier, and we have a tremendous amount of momentum against this program. There has been adoption across the company. To the extent that we can actually start realizing some of those savings earlier, then that that also will impact. So, I think we\u2019re pretty confident that we have a lot of irons in the fire in terms of improving margin. What we\u2019re not confident of and hence the reason why we are saying around 50 basis points of margin expansion annually, so that\u2019s an average over the three-year time horizon. Again, it could be 30 bps one year and 70 bps or, like you indicated, 100 bps last year, excluding some of those items. What we\u2019re not confident of is the macro environment. So, we have experienced a fair amount of geopolitical tension and volatility whether it\u2019s in our travel retail channel or in many of our markets. And so, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent for us to not consider that that could be a factor this year and over the next few years. So, whether you call that conservatism or whether you call that prudence, that is certainly contemplated in our guidance. The last thing I would say is we do have a number of new brands that we are building. We\u2019ve done several acquisitions, as you indicated, over the last few years. And we are supporting them in terms of distribution growth and, in many cases, building their presence in markets that \u2013 new markets that they\u2019re entering globally. And so, that is factored into our guidance as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a real quick question on your channel mix. I think you indicated department stores are about 17%, online about 20%. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help bridge the balance across specialty-multi, freestanding and some of the other venues where you\u2019re distributing? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So, just a reminder that that 17% was U.S. department stores. Our department store mix now is about 40% globally, a little over 40% globally. And so, this is one of the first years where actually our overseas department store business is larger than our U.S. department store business. On specialty-multi we talked about on the last call, and with Too Faced and BECCA and what they have added to the specialty-multi channel given their presence, we\u2019re at about 11% in terms of specialty-multi is where we ended the year. And then Dennis talked about where we\u2019re at online, which is in the 9% to 10%, and expecting 11% in this upcoming year. So, that generally is where we\u2019re at. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, I would like to take the opportunity of this question to make one thing noticeable, that we have double-digit growth in many of these channels. But if you just take the combination of travel retail, specialty-multi, online, you arrive, just with these three, at well about one-third of the company. And this is growing very strongly and very double-digit, more than 20% each one of these channels, et cetera. So, we are in a situation from a channel diversification that we have more than one-third of the company growing in the high-20s and that\u2019s very, very strong. So, the channel mix is actually a great point of our strategy of multiple engines of growth and diversification and is one of the key element which is building momentum. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS. Mr. Powers, your line\u2019s open. Steve Powers : Hello. Can you hear me? Tracey Travis : Yes. Steve Powers : Great. Sorry about that. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the U.S. business, if I could. As you look forward to the second half when BECCA and Too Faced become part of the base business, do you expect U.S. growth to return to positive territory at that point? And can that continue? Question number one. And then just to clarify on your 2018 outlook, do you expect new door openings versus closings to be a net tailwind to the U.S. business in fiscal 2018 because there\u2019s a lot of stuff that you\u2019re putting in motion? Or are you still factoring in some net headwind from department store closings? Just some clarity there would be great. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So, yes, in our plans, there is a stabilization of the U.S. business without BECCA and Too Faced and absolutely. That\u2019s what we are aiming for and working for. And the second question, we believe that we can open more distribution points than what will be closed. And so, this will be \u2013 is in our numbers. There\u2019s still a net improvement of consumer reach in our plans. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning, everyone. As you think about the freestanding store footprint and how it\u2019s growing relative to online, what do you think the potential is for freestanding stores and also specialty-multi channel? How does that penetration develop? And then new product launches, as you look going forward, what brands do you think will have the most impactful launches of in fiscal 2018, and is there any quarters we should look to for that? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So, freestanding \u2013 go, go. Tracey Travis : Yes. So, Dana, we expect that freestanding stores will continue to show strong growth. And one of the things that Dennis spoke about is how we are enabling more productivity in our freestanding stores through linking them to more omni-channel capabilities, whether it\u2019s loyalty programs or other things that we are doing to try to keep the consumer in a branded experience leveraging technology and we will continue to do that. So, we certainly recognize that even though online represents 11% of our sales mix, that means 89% is in brick-and-mortar somewhere. And freestanding stores are still \u2013 play an important role. There is no question that we are making sure, as we look at opening new freestanding stores, that we are contemplating the online growth in the region and how many points of distribution we need in a particular market so that we can make sure we are not over-saturating any market with brick-and-mortar distribution with the fast growth of online. So, that is factored into our retail plans. As it relates to specialty-multi, specialty-multi has continued to grow quite strongly, both the online sites of specialty-multi which Dennis talked about how he works with all of our retail partners with their online business to make sure our brands are represented well online. But we\u2019re also seeing strong growth in specialty-multi. In the U.S., certainly, ULTA and Sephora, but also in our international markets as well. So, we expect that that, too, will continue as a great alternative for consumers. One of the things that we see and, again, as both Fabrizio and Dennis mentioned, we are getting much better at tracking our consumer and utilizing our consumer information for decision-making. And we see that whether it\u2019s millennials or Gen X or Gen Z or we, ageless, consumers like to shop multiple channels. And so, there\u2019s more choice than ever out there in terms of shopping. Online is very convenient, but in-store offers a different experience. And certainly freestanding stores offer a different experience than specialty-multi, than department stores. But she likes to shop multiple experiences. And so, we are certainly focused on making sure all of our points of distribution, including online, are well-represented from a branding experience. Fabrizio Freda : In terms of innovation, we have one of the strongest innovation pipelines. As I said in my prepared remarks, the innovation in fiscal 2018 will be also very focused on reinforcing the existing very strong franchises which are in all brands \u2013 Too Faced, Peach or Better Than Sex, Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, Clinique taking the Fresh Pressed concept to the next level, et cetera, et cetera. So, there is a lot of buildup. You are now going to see one blockbuster which is a high-return, high-risk. You\u2019re going to see every brand to have three, five, big serious initiative well-focused by category. And the portfolio of innovation of the company to cover all the opportunity by sub-category and region in a much more sophisticated way than we did in the past, thanks to better analytic and better preplanning. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. Thanks very much for the follow-up. Just want to go to the impairment charges of $31 million on Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and Olio Lusso. What percentage of the purchase price of those brands did that represent? And clearly, that\u2019s typically because the business didn\u2019t perform quite as well as you\u2019d thought. So, I\u2019d love to understand why and if it\u2019s helping you think about the future acquisitions in any way. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : No. Frankly, this is very small. I mean, only one small fragrance brand is really in these impairment. And then one very small brand that was part of the acquisition before. And most of the other brands are growing double-digit, triple-digit, out of our [indiscernible] where we\u2019re including the small brands where we have an impairment on. They are all growing double-digit or triple-digit. And in the case of the impairment, it actually is a timing issue. So, frankly, no. We believe our acquisitions have been very successful and there is only one brand that has a small delay which in the context of the many acquisition that we have done is frankly not relevant. We are very satisfied with acquisition and we believe that BECCA and Too Faced and the other acquisition we have done particularly in the fragrances, or GLAMGLOW for example, are extremely successful and will continue to be a big part of our growth. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. If you are unable to join the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 :00 PM Eastern Time today through September 1. To hear a recording of the call, please dial 855-859-2056. Pass code number 65289585. That concludes today\u2019s Est\u00e9e Lauder Call.

Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our new fiscal year is off to a terrific start. We delivered an outstanding financial performance in the first quarter, powered by multiple engines of growth across our business. Both sales and earnings per share rose double-digits, and all of our regions and major categories advanced. Our 13% constant currency sales increase exceeded our forecast, and we leveraged the incremental top line results into excellent earnings growth, aided by cost savings and efficiencies. We accelerated the momentum that we experienced at the end of fiscal year 2017 by continuing to focus on fast growing brands, channels, and countries, and fueled these areas with additional resources and investments. We targeted new consumers as we expanded our reach, especially with millennials, and they were drawn to our innovative, high-quality products. More influencers' attention, sophisticated social media programs and a digital-first mindset across our brands helped drive our success. With an encouraging start to the year and continued confidence in our outlook, we are increasing our full-year sales and EPS guidance. In constant currency, we now expect our sales to rise 8% to 9% and earnings per share growth of 12% to 14% in fiscal year 2018. At the same time, we are mindful of external geopolitical and economic issues that could pose challenges to our business. Looking out our categories, makeup has been strong for several years and continued to be robust across many of our brands. Too Faced and BECCA contributed significantly along with Tom Ford and Est\u00e9e Lauder. What stood out in this quarter, however, was our skin care performance which rebounded strongly, a trend we are seeing in the industry. Our improvement stemmed from strength in existing products and successful recent launches from Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, and GLAMGLOW, as they captured many new consumers. Our fragrance categories growth came largely from our luxury and our artisanal brands, which are gaining traction worldwide and have developed into a strong growth engine. Nearly all brands in our portfolio advanced globally. Our flagship Est\u00e9e Lauder brand generated double-digit global growth with positive results in every region, led by particular strengths from Chinese consumers and global travelers. Aligned with the company's strategy, Est\u00e9e Lauder has developed multiple engines of growth across its categories, channels, and geographies. Much of the brand's momentum stemmed from an acceleration in skin care on top of continuous strength in makeup. This was reflected in the success of these powerful hero franchises, including the Advanced Night Repair and Re-Nutriv skin care collections and Double Wear and Pure Color makeup lines. This marks Est\u00e9e Lauder's fourth consecutive quarter of solid sales growth, in the last two quarters, up double-digits. Our M\u00b7A\u00b7C brand grew modestly on a global basis, thanks to excellent gains in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, where its business more than doubled. Growth also came from travel retail, where its sales climbed double-digits. M\u00b7A\u00b7C has successfully captured new consumers, helping to deliver sequential improvements also in North America. Our luxury brands continued to enjoy strong worldwide demand. La Mer, Jo Malone, Tom Ford each grew double-digits in every region. And our newness brand are performing well, and we build their equities and broaden their reach to a targeted consumer base. To stay in the lead in prestige beauty, we continued to successfully pivot to the high-growth channels, where more consumers are shopping. Our sales in travel retail, specialty-multi and online each grew strong double-digits. Sales gains in travel retail reflected higher passenger traffic, a greater number of Chinese travelers to Hong Kong and Macau, compelling offering and a wider exposure of some of mid-sized brands. All of our brands benefited from the positive trend. Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and La Mer were standouts while most of the portfolio had healthy gains, including Clinique, which rose sharply on strong demand for its moisturizers. All regions grew in travel retail. Asia/Pacific led the growth with Chinese consumer traveling in greater numbers within Asia as well as to key tourist destinations in Europe. We continued rolling out some of our newer brands in major airports, including By Kilian or Le Labo. For the fiscal year, we expect our travel retail business to remain robust based on expected strong passenger traffic growth, increased conversion of travelers into buyers and sustained demand for our products, particularly from emerging market consumers. We plan to invest more in China and other emerging markets this fiscal year to further build awareness and demand for our brands. We should benefit consumption in both the local market and several travel corridors. Our strong online business was led by third-party and retailer sites. Globally, our metrics improved across the board, including higher traffic, conversions, and orders. We continued to garner new consumers throughout our business on Tmall in China, where our sales more than doubled, fueled in part by M\u00b7A\u00b7C's successful launch in May. In the recent quarter, M\u00b7A\u00b7C also successfully launched on a large online platform in Southeast Asia owned by Alibaba called Lazada with a brand building distribution model similar to Tmall, where we control the look and the content of the virtual store. We expect to expand on the platform in more markets and with more brands starting this quarter. We continue to broaden our global online footprint with new site launches and retailer distribution expansion. In the quarter, we added more than 100 sites. The majority were retailers and most of them in the European region, demonstrating the scalability of our digital model. Spurred by the growth of social media and technology advancement, mobile is the focus of our digital strategies. In the recent quarter, mobile accounted for 70% of our global online traffic. We are seeing the results of our investment in mobile, as it is an important factor driving first time digital consumers in emerging markets and increasing the frequency of purchases in more developed countries. We also continue to strengthen our position in specialty-multi retailers globally. Many of our brands expanded their target reach as they pushed younger consumers drawn by the channel. M\u00b7A\u00b7C roll out in ULTA Beauty in North America has resonated strongly, as approximately half the consumer who purchased M\u00b7A\u00b7C products were new or lapsed users of the brand. M\u00b7A\u00b7C has become a best-selling makeup brand in the large majority of ULTA Beauty stores where it opened. And based on the strong initial performance, we plan to accelerate its expansion there. By opening in more specialty-multi stores globally, M\u00b7A\u00b7C will continue to balance a meaningful presence in all major channels, department stores, freestanding stores, specialty-multi, online, and travel retail. Internationally, we are strategically expanding our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, in the specialty-multi channel which is their primary distribution focus. We have entered certain European markets through Sephora and other retailers and are highly ranked. Several brands are actively expanding in specialty-multi in Korea where sales has been excellent. For example, Clinique and Origins each added more than 50 doors of Olive Young. Turning to our geographies, our sales in China soared. Virtually all our brands there grew double-digits, while some, notably M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Tom Ford, and Lab Series, more than doubled. Our makeup business in total doubled for the second consecutive quarter while skin care accelerated. Our luxury fragrance brands also performed beautiful. Our brands have strengthened our position with Chinese consumers, and our analytics show that much of this growth is coming from consumers new to our brands. Our retail sales accelerated sequentially from last quarter, and importantly, we gained share. The surge in consumption for luxury beauty in China is due in part to stronger demand from millennials in lower prices as a result of import tax reductions which have given consumers more purchasing power. We foresee continued strong interest in luxury products by Chinese consumers and plan to continue investing in the country. Hong Kong delivered strong gains as tourist traffic increased and local demand improved, contributing to increases across categories. More investment in digital and social media helped drive awareness. We have been strengthening the portfolio of our newness brand by providing R&D and supply chain capabilities. We are also identifying new distribution opportunities where we see strong consumer interest. As a result, we launched several of our new luxury fragrance brands in European flagship department stores that have significant tourist traffic. In the U.S., we are committed to collaborating with department stores to drive growth both in store and online by exciting consumers with product innovation and better services. This quarter, our sales from many of the stores' online sites were robust, and although our business in brick-and-mortar continued to be challenged, we saw early signs of progress. We are encouraged that our organic sales in North America department stores showed sequential improvement for the quarter, despite the impact of hurricanes that affected our business for several weeks in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. This speaks to the breadth and strength of our portfolio, as well to our channel mix. On a more personal level, we are proud of the work that the company has done to help our affected employees and their families in the areas disrupted by the storms. Fueling our success across channels and geographies was an array of exciting products that captivated consumers. We continue to focus our innovation on our biggest franchises, striving to make our hero products in every brand even more valuable, introducing new products with an important franchise brings it more attention and increases sales across the key areas of our business. Through effective social media, our brands are inspiring more trial of core product lines, which more often lead to repeat purchases and brand loyalty. For example, Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced a new eye serum under Advanced Night Repair line, the ANR Eye Concentrate Matrix. It was highly successful worldwide and helped drive sales of the entire franchise. Likewise, Clinique newest Moisture Surge product, a supercharged concentrate, boosted the collection and created the halo effect on the moisturizer's sub-category, which is a strategic focus area for Clinique. Moisture Surge sales have increased significantly for the last two years globally and, in the recent quarter, rose more than 30% as retail in the U.S. Clinique plans to bolster the Moisture Surge franchise with additional products. As we promote our wide array of beauty products, we are focusing our marketing spending on digital to allow how consumers are seeking communications and information. Each of our brands has adopted a digital-first mind-set with an emphasis on mobile. With a tailored approach, each brand continuously decide which platforms and messages are most effective in reaching their target consumers. Another important piece of our digital strategy is social media, especially the use of influencers, who have proven to help our brands standout. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand recently named a new global beauty director, who is attracting younger consumer and collaborating on product development. Clinique uses hundreds of local influencers all over the world, who promote its products in culturally-relevant ways. Clinique China business was solid this quarter, due in part to improved consumer engagement. Looking to the holiday season, we believe our compelling programs will drive traffic to stores and support our overall business. Clinique has developed desirable sets that will be competitively positioned, while M\u00b7A\u00b7C's Snow Ball collection reflects current fashion trends. We continue to invest in capabilities and talent. Our performance is the reflection of our terrific teams across the globe who were able to quickly pivot and execute change smoothly. We continuously developed our bench strength to ensure that our business leaders are in the best positions to perform with excellence and advance our strategies. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is enabling us to cut expenses, become more efficient, and create great leverage of our sales growth. This will allow us to invest more in best growth opportunities by also expanding our operating margin. We are maintaining some flexibility to allocate further resources to our biggest opportunities with the potential to spur momentum. We plan to devote greater resources to our strongest growth engines; China, global digital commerce, product innovation, and travel retail, to advance our industry leadership and sustain our growth above global prestige beauty. We are gratified to be starting this fiscal year on such a high note, which is a testament to our winning strategy, to the agility of our talent and to our execution capability. We are optimistic about our future and excited about the global opportunities that lies ahead while remaining mindful of potential macro risks. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2008 first quarter financial results and then cover our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Net sales for the first quarter were $3.27 billion, up 13% in constant currency compared to the prior-year period. Incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 4 percentage points of this growth, as expected, which means our organic growth accelerated this quarter to 9%, exceeding our expectations. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18% in constant currency, driven by a strong double-digit increase in our global travel retail business. Travel corridors in Asia led much of the growth and they were fueled by strong demand in local markets that drove solid passenger traffic, exceptional like-door growth, and some additional points of sale outside of travel retail. Business was more mixed in the region's other markets. Our sales in the Balkans, Turkey, and India grew strong double-digits and we had solid increases in Italy, the U.K., and Switzerland. These gains were partially offset by declines in Germany, the Middle East, and South Africa. In the Asia/Pacific region, sales rose 17% in constant currency, driven primarily by the accelerated momentum in China. Sales in China rose almost 50%, with broad-based growth across brands and channels. Hong Kong also accelerated, rising 14% off of a very soft performance prior year. We also achieved solid sales growth in Taiwan and Malaysia. Net sales in the Americas grew 7% in constant currency. Excluding the incremental sales from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, the region's sales declined 3%. The U.S. had continued strong growth in specialty-multi, retail and online, including department store online sites but remained challenged in much of the mall-based brick-and-mortar stores. Canada also declined slightly due to softness at Sears Canada, which is liquidating. And Latin America sales fell moderately in the first quarter. Our gross margin declined 90 basis points compared to the first quarter last year due primarily to the impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisitions and the associated inventory step-up. The mix of sets of new products largely offset favorable category mix and efficiency gains. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 360 basis points, primarily due to lower selling expenses due to our sales channel mix as well as continued expense controls. We also benefited from a change in the timing of stock compensation expenses due to a new provision in our equity award agreements, which will adversely impact OpEx in the second and third quarters, offsetting the first quarter benefit. Operating income rose 34% and operating margin increased by 270 basis points. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 22.3%, reflecting the impact of the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement related to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. In our first quarter, we recognized $23 million of excess tax benefits as a reduction to our income tax provision. This benefit, which flowed through stockholders' equity prior to the change, reduced our effective tax rate for the quarter by 420 basis points and added $0.06 to our EPS. Diluted EPS of $1.21 increased 42% compared to the prior year and grew 41% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of favorable currency translation. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the outstanding results delivered by our China and travel retail businesses, stronger overall growth in skin care and continued disciplined expense management. Given our strong results, we plan to maintain the flexibility to redeploy some of these funds to further support areas of momentum over the next few quarters. Our Leading Beauty Forward efforts are going very well. We have great momentum with approximately 60 initiatives identified and approved, and we continue to uncover further opportunities. For example, we are optimizing our go-to-market selling and education areas and providing employees with digital tools to better and more efficiently serve our retailers and our consumers. We established a new global shared services organization called 1Source (23:30), which is designed to efficiently deliver fundamental services to the company. Initially, 1Source (23:35) will provide select finance, legal, and HR services and, over time, will expand its offering to generate even more services. And our brands are building locally-relevant consumer engagement capabilities with increased investment in digital assets and experiences. We are very pleased with the progress we've made and the hard work of all of the employees involved who have embraced Leading Beauty Forward with The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' competitive spirit. During the quarter, we generated $93 million in net cash flows from operating activities and we invested $116 million in capital expenditures. We used $111 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our stock and paid $126 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share. Now, let me turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. We've had a terrific start to our fiscal year and yet we do recognize that a variety of macro risks, including the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union, political instability in many areas around the world, and soft economies in certain markets create an ongoing level of uncertainty in many parts of our business. Additionally, I want to remind you that comparisons will normalize more in the second half of the year when Too Faced and BECCA will be in the base year, and we are more closely lapping more of the sequential improvements we saw throughout fiscal 2017 in China, Hong Kong, and travel retail. That said, we are raising our sales guidance expectation to 8% to 9% in constant currency for the full fiscal 2018 year. This estimate includes approximately 2 points of growth from the incremental sales of Too Faced and BECCA. Currency translation is expected to benefit reported sales growth by 2 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.18 for the euro, $1.34 for the pound, and $112 for the yen for the fiscal year. The strength of our first quarter performance allows us to both raise guidance and to maintain some flexibility to invest in areas of strength to propel momentum and help protect against downside macro risk. Supporting the strong performance we have in the Asia/Pacific region remains a priority, as does accelerating the rollout of our newest brands. We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.04 to $4.12 before restructuring and other charges, including approximately $0.16 of benefit from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 12% to 14%. At this time, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%. While this guidance includes the first quarter impact of the new accounting pronouncement for share-based compensation, we are not forecasting the impact for the remainder of the year given the level of uncertainty in estimating how the stock market will perform, as well as uncertainty with both the timing and level of employee stock option exercises. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 10% to 11% in constant currency, reflecting early confidence in our holiday assortments, new products, and expanded targeted consumer reach. Currency translation is estimated to add approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. Too Faced and BECCA are also forecast to add approximately 3 points to sales growth for the quarter. As I mentioned before, by the end of the second quarter, these two brands will have lapped their acquisition dates and will be part of our organic growth in the back half of the fiscal year. EPS is forecast between $1.38 and $1.41 before restructuring charges, and this includes about $0.07 benefit from currency. We are, obviously, pleased with the momentum we saw in the first quarter and with our progress, executing our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We remain focused on delivering another successful year of solid top-line growth, margin expansion, and double-digit EPS increases. And that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Our first question today comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning folks. Congratulations on a strong start to the year. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: You're welcome, and thank you for letting me ask a question. I guess I wanted to delve a little bit deeper in terms of the swirling tide of what's happening underneath the hood of beauty growth overall, prestige beauty growth. You mentioned skin care getting better, makeup slowing. We've also seen in some of the measured data out there a bit of a slowdown in some of the small brands that have encroached upon the territory in the last couple of years. It's raised some consternation of what it means for the sustainable growth of some of your recent acquisitions. I'd love to hear you weigh in on what you're seeing, and what you expect from Too Faced and BECCA as they roll into the base? But, maybe as importantly, if not more importantly, weigh in with what this shift may mean in terms of your stronghold in skin care, the implications for your market share overall, and the implications for margins on the Forward? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Wow, this is one question. But yes, basically, prestige market we believe will continue to grow 4% to 5%. In this moment, it's pretty solid. The drivers of the global prestige market, frankly, are not changing, and they are the higher consumption of prestige from the millennial consumers. The higher access to luxury and prestige businesses in emerging markets, particularly in China. And the continuous \u2013 the higher level of usage, particularly on makeup, of the millennial consumers versus previous generations. The recent improvements of the trend is in skin care where the millennials are also entering more than skin care business. Now what is the consequence of us of this is frankly a better balance of the growth between makeup and skin care is favorable to us because our skin care margins are better than the overall makeup margins, but I want still to remind that, within makeup, there are certain categories like face or foundation, which are also very profitably like many other skin care categories. So it's a very good positive. In term of the impact of this trend on Too Faced and BECCA, makeup is growing. Now the new news is the acceleration of skin care. Frankly, I don't see any big issue with deceleration of makeup, also because makeup continues to grow internationally in a very strong way, and we are, in fact, deploying Too Faced and BECCA more internationally. So what is our expectation for Too Faced and BECCA? Obviously, after we have finished to add them \u2013 when we will add them in the base, we plan to continue growing this brand double-digit and, as part of this, the internationalization of these two brands will be an important step. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. My question had to do with the U.S. business. Tracey, I think you threw out a number of the U.S. business being down 3% ex the acquisitions. And I know that's just sort of a reflection of tough times in department stores, et cetera, et cetera. But what's your outlook there? I mean when does the specialty-multi distribution become big enough so that it really offsets your exposure to the department stores so that we can see positive growth in that core organic U.S. growth? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Well, I'll start and then perhaps Fabrizio will pipe in. So we do expect, Wendy, to your point and spoke about the fact that we do expect to roll out more brands in specialty-multi this year. We've rolled out Bumble and bumble into specialty-multi. We continue to rollout M\u00b7A\u00b7C into specialty-multi. So we now have a good representation of brands in specialty-multi, and are doing quite well as we said in our prepared remarks. At the same time, Fabrizio reinforced the fact that we are also partnered with our department store customers to try to stabilize some of the declines that we've seen in their brick-and-mortar business \u2013 again, the retailer dot-com business is growing quite nicely, but in the brick-and-mortar business and a lot of good dialogue and discussion there, and we hope to see some improvement in that area. Those two things combined, we expect to come out of this year in a much better position as it relates to the U.S. market, both in terms of us having diversified our distribution more with our brand portfolio and hoping for some stabilization based on the activities of ourselves in combination with our retail partners in department stores and brick-and-mortar. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yes. And I just want to underline the point that we are working very closely to our department store partners to look for accelerating and finding a better way to attract higher traffics also in the brick-and-mortar malls \u2013 stores, and we see some promising signs that some of the activity we are testing and learning about has a stronger effect on consumers than what we have done in the last couple of years. So we will keep focusing on that. But to Tracey's point is the balance (34:30) is being where the consumer is. And I want to underline where the consumer is, is more and more online. And so our strength online including our strength online with our department store partners is a big part of this mitigating impact of the change of traffic in the country. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I have an admittedly two-part question about your guidance. So first on top line, the back half of the year implies organic sales growth decelerating from, call it, 9% roughly now to below the 6% to 7% organic sales growth number. So can you talk through that organic top line deceleration a bit? And what's your expectation on comp store versus distribution growth? And then similarly in guidance, so your SG&A this quarter was down 380 basis points it looks like. Can you talk about the drivers of that specifically? How much was mix? So channel, product, geographic, so how much was mix? And how much is actual apples-to-apples cost reduction? And all that's really tied together, but trying to understand the run rate going forward for you guys, especially in the back half of the year. Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Sure, sure. So let me start with the cadence of the year in terms of organic growth. As you'll recall, Ali, we are anniversarying a fairly soft quarter last year. Our organic growth last year was 2% \u2013 a little over 2%, and so the 9% is on top of the 2% from last year from an organic standpoint and obviously not having Too Faced and BECCA in our numbers. We saw sequential improvement throughout the year, particularly in the second half in terms of our organic growth. So we started to see the pickup largely in our Asian markets, so certainly in China, in Hong Kong, as well as in our travel retail markets and that would be global. And so we are anniversarying that. And when you look at the second half of the year, both the combination of having Too Faced and BECCA embedded within the second half of the year still growing double-digits for both of those brands but also anniversarying that sequential improvement that we saw in our Asia and travel retail markets last year, that's where you see the organic growth starting to mitigate a bit in the second half of the year, still meaning that we have a terrific year that we expect to well outgrow the industry and gain share. As it relates to the SG&A in the quarter, I did talk about one timing issue that was embedded in that number, and that was a change in our stock comp plans that actually just caused a timing shift in the recognition of some of our stock comp expense. This is not the tax accounting change, but this is actually embedded in our expenses. So we had a little over 100 basis points of impact of that in terms of favorability in the first quarter that we'll see reverse out in the second and third quarter. The balance of the favorability was, to your point, a combination of mix as well as expense controls, and I would say it's about 50-50 in terms of the balance of between mix and expense controls. After that shift, that timing shift. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about GLAMGLOW. It's been about two years since the acquisition and you just called it out as an outstanding double-digit growth in the release. So I was just kind of curious about, I guess, one would be how the product line has expanded, two, any international expansion that's going to happen that maybe kind of slipped beneath the radar screen for me? And just over kind of outlook for that business, particularly now that the skin care category's accelerating. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. No, GLAMGLOW is doing extremely well. It's continued to grow in the U.S. and is expanding internationally, is, in this moment, very successful in the U.K., for example, and is expanding in other markets. The target that we are hitting is the younger consumer. So millennials really like GLAMGLOW. The strength of the GLAMGLOW, in this moment, skin care proposition, are several, but two standouts in my opinion. One is that the glow overall promise of the entire brand, the benefit of glowing skin is one of the most desirable benefits in the market in this moment and, importantly, is the most desirable benefit for younger skins, which is behind a lot of the growth we are seeing in skin care around the world, which is driven by that target group. The second strength is the fact that this brand is focused on masks, and masks is the fastest-growing product category in skin care in this moment in most of the global regions. And third is that this brand is, as you said in your question, expanding into other categories beyond masks. And every single very careful decision we have taken to expand the category is working and is giving great results. It is coherent from a consumer standpoint. And finally, as I already said, the internationalization of the opportunity. So again, a good acquisition, a good promising start of the acceleration of this brand, and a lot still do to in the next years to make this brand one of our mid-size and then one day very big brands in our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning, and congratulations from me. I'd like to know a little bit more about your online growth. You did talk about how strong it was in China. Can you talk about other markets; what you're seeing in terms of growth rates online? Are they accelerating or declining in any of your big markets, specifically the U.S.? And is your market share, as far as you know, bigger or smaller online? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So our online business is still growing very strong. We were up 33% in quarter one. And our online by now represent about 11% of total sales now globally, but the penetration is much higher than 11% in some of the top markets where online is very strong. We are growing our online business this quarter in general in our estimate for the year. We have growth in our brand dot-com, in our retail dot-com, and in platforms. So all the three segments are growing very strongly. This quarter, particularly brand dot-com remain very strong, but we saw a tremendous acceleration of platforms, namely Tmall. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the beginning of our investment in Lazada in Southeast Asia. And we saw amazing progress in retail dot-com across the world. So growth in department store retail dot-com in the U.S., growth in the specialty-multi retail dot-com and growth in many retail dot-coms around the world. Actually, the exception is China where in China is now retail dot-com driven but is Tmall driving the growth. So very strong and, as we said also in the prepared remark, clearly scalable. We have opened 100 sites just this quarter in a very efficient way, scalable and agile, meaning where we see it works, we can invest more. Where it doesn't work, we can smoothly change and revise and review what we're doing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. I guess bigger picture here, your operating margins were 17% in 2014 and your guidance has you about getting back there by 2020 and recognizing a lot of that in the Americas where you've had a big currency headwind. It's now a tailwind. E-commerce makes it seems to be a tailwind. Why shouldn't you be able to get back towards peak margin in that segment, which would mean peak margin across the company and beyond that? And what are the margin drivers that are still going on with the Americas right now that sort of limit that now that you have these mix factors and maybe a little better performance in department stores happening? Thanks very much. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think that in terms of the currency headwinds that we've had in the past, it's beyond the Americas, right? So, certainly, in the last couple of years, we've had negative currency that has offset quite a few of the initiatives that we've had in terms of cost-savings initiatives. When we guided the year, we said that we expect over the next few years to have on, average, 50 basis points of margin improvement. When you strip out all the noise from last year, we actually had 100 basis points of margin improvement. So \u2013 and we certainly have, in addition to continuing with some basic cost-saving programs, have the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which is expected to deliver a fair amount of savings and allow us to leverage our organization in the next few years. So I believe that we will certainly get back to the historical margin and then some, given all the initiatives that we have over the last few years \u2013 over the next few years. But right now, our guidance is, on average, 50 basis points a year. And, as you know, we'll update that at the beginning of every fiscal year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. First, just a quick detail question. Tracey, can you give us a sense of your A&P spending year-over-year as a percent of sales in Q1 and how that compares versus the balance of the year, just given the SG&A performance in Q1? And then, the real question, Fabrizio, is you had this tremendous sales momentum in China in travel retail the last two quarters. How sustainable do you think that momentum is as you look out longer term? Tracey mentioned those areas should slow a bit in the second half with more difficult comparisons. So just want to get some more detail on the key drivers behind the recent strength and how much they extend longer term from your perspective? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So I'll start with your question on A&P. In the first quarter, we did see quite a healthy increase in A&P spend. It did not grow as fast as sales that we saw a slight amount of leverage in our A&P spend, but we actually expected to deleverage for the year. Again, we are making investments in several areas that generate momentum for the organization. And so we ultimately expect that it will \u2013 the A&P spend will grow faster than what we're projecting our sales growth to grow for the full year, which is a nice increase for us in terms of investment in markets that are growing quite fast. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. On the other two questions, so the short answer, and then I'll give you more detail, is that we believe that a double-digit growth is sustainable. Now, the 50%, 40% are \u2013 may happen again by quarter depending on volatility, but I could not define (47:17) them as sustainable model, obviously. The double-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in retail over the long run should be sustainable trends. Let me go one by one. In China, we are seeing, in this moment, an amazing results, but also in like-door we have 33%. And that's super strong, we are growing market share. And interesting, this quarter we saw these amazing results without increasing the number of cities, but just increasing the number of doors in the cities where we need to be more penetrated, where we need to put more brands. So it's about more establishing our strengths rather than further expanding the number of cities this quarter, which, again, shows the power of online in city \u2013 in China, where the cities where we're not expanding brick-and-mortar yet, because it's not yet efficient, we still can reach the city with online. So the model is pretty interesting, pretty sustainable, and has power. The second thing I would like to say on China, the market continued to grow. So we are growing above the market and building market share, but the market was about 30% growth, so very strong. It's about new consumer. It's about new access, as I said in my prepared remarks. The other important thing in China is we are growing in every single channel in China : department stores, Sephora, freestanding stores, online. They're all growing double-digits. So there is a really well spread. And then in every brand in our portfolio, we are growing. We are growing in makeup. We are growing in skin care. We are growing in fragrance. So it's broad growth, and so it's sustainable, in our opinion, on a more or less double-digit trend. On travel retail, travel retail has been very strong. We have seen this quarter an acceleration of travel retail in the retail \u2013 at retail levels, so a retail acceleration. And this is driven by trends which are sustainable, some trends are the market, meaning the traffic of travelers is very solid. But a lot of what's happened is driven by us. One is about conversion, meaning today we estimate that 15%, depending on airport region, of people entering in airport shop anything. So it's just driving the conversion from travelers to shoppers is an enormous opportunity to continuous traffic growth, and this isn't the end of the brands because this has a lot to do with investments we do in the current (49:45) or in the market of all regions. So the fact that we are investing more in China, we are investing more in Brazil, we are investing more in Russia, et cetera, this is the reason why our countries in travel retail is working better and better, because our conversion in travel retail thanks to the marketing work that our teams do in every one of these countries is working better and better thanks to the assortment we choose in these places is getting better and better. So it's not only about traffic, it's about what we do and what we invest in every single country. And that's why we believe that this is sustainable of more or less a double-digit trend in the long term. The other reason why it's sustainable is very broad. As I explained, it's not only Asia. We grew in travel retail in EMEA, in Latin America, in the U.S., in Asia. Obviously Asia has been particularly strong, but it's broad-based the growth that we see in this moment. And we have developed a strategy where we really can follow the consumer across traveling corridors, and we can make sure also our innovation speaks to them in a coherent way between current country or regions (50:56) where they travel. And so, in summary, strong and sustainable, but not at the levels we have seen this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Our question relates to skin care margins. We saw a very, very strong increase year-over-year and just generally I think the strongest skin care margins we have in our models going back a couple of decades. I'm just curious if you can talk about sustainability within the margin profile of skin care. And then, Fabrizio, to your comments on the millennials, are you seeing anything trend-wise that would give you confidence in that margin structure in that category? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Okay. Skin care \u2013 and now, Tracey, please add any perspectives. Skin care has strong margins structurally in our business. However, when there is a beat of skin care sales where the extra skin care sales versus our original forecast comes without a lot of expenses, this margin gets boosted in the short term. So I will not consider the quarter one margins as sustainable, but definitely we can count on stronger than average skin care margins in the future for the growth of skin care. And in terms of millennials, the millennials are obviously getting more and more in skin care in what I define in summary, instant benefits. Before I was speaking about GLAMGLOW and the glow benefit, there are other benefits which are instant, which is about preparing the skin for makeup, is about benefits for the day. So not only traditional anti-aging but instant benefit for the skin are very popular with millennials around the world, and this will continue also because we are driving it and, frankly, the industry is driving that. So I believe this can be an interesting medium-term trend. Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: No. That's good. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about how to think about your thoughts on the 4% to 5% category growth. It seems like some conservatism there. Just wanted to explore that a bit more and maybe, put differently, why is company share accelerating if the 4% to 5% category growth is correct? And if you couple your performance with peers like LVMH and L'Oreal, that trio collectively is growing something like three-times what you believe the category is actually growing at. So is it share gains amongst the big three? Is it sustainable as a result of that or what is just driving it? Or, as I said, part of it could be that you're just being a bit conservative with the category growth. So maybe any help there would be appreciated. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. No, frankly, this is the number that we see, we estimate for the year. Now, could be more 5% than 4%, absolutely, this first quarter was very solid. But you need to look at the \u2013 this is a global estimate. Now the retail in the U.S. is not super strong. The retail in Continental Europe is not super strong. U.K. is softening in term of market. The Latin America market is not super strong. So what you see today is actually an acceleration in Asia, absolutely. But you don't see in terms of total market every single region accelerated. So in total, with plus and minus, we still believe a 4% to 5%, probably more in the 5% area is what we see today. Which bring me to the second point that is, yes, we \u2013 I cannot speak for our competitors but from the number I see, I would agree with you, the big three are strong and are delivering market share growth overall, and we definitely are. We are growing market share in a significant way. And I think this is explainable in many ways but one way maybe I want to add as far Est\u00e9e Lauder Company are concerned. The big amount of the small brands and new launches, innovation that's happening in the market has created a much more competitive trial environment, meaning consumer buying new products, try new products, being able to access many more new products. But repurchase is continued to be driven by high-quality products at brand they trust. So while the trial game is more competitive, the repurchase game is still in the hands of the hero franchises, the big brands, and these brands continue to deliver very strong repurchase. Remember, a lot of the profitability is in repurchase because trial, most of the time, is an investment. And so what you see is the power of product quality, the power of prestige experiences into play, and that in this very competitive market out there, still strong brands, great quality products, and fundamental superior experiences remain the reason for success. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Congrats on a great quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. I was curious to get additional thoughts on the U.S. beauty backdrop. Some of the specialty-multi players have called out softening trends in the cosmetics category within the U.S. market. So I was just curious, from your perspective, the dynamics currently playing out in the market, is it a shift more to skin care, less newness, or other factors at play? Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So I think that there has been a bit of softening in the U.S. market, again, mostly in, in brick-and-mortar. As we spoke about, certainly, we've seen a lot of strength in online. So we are certainly continuing to see that. The other thing that's happening in the U.S. \u2013 and Fabrizio was talking about online and how we play in various areas of online, but there are beauty brands that are direct-to-consumer that are online-only that bypass any retailer. And these are some of the indie brands as well. And we see more of this phenomena in the U.S. market than in some of our global markets as well. So I think that, too, is impacting some of the results of some of the retailers. They're not captured in the retailers' dot-com business because they're actually \u2013 it's a brand to direct sale, things that come to mind like Kylie Cosmetics for instance. Operator : We have time for one more question. That question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to circle back on M\u00b7A\u00b7C, I just have a couple of questions. It's positive that M\u00b7A\u00b7C in total grew in the quarter, but I guess I was hoping you could drill down further on M\u00b7A\u00b7C's performance in North America specifically. Could you talk about your standalone M\u00b7A\u00b7C stores and how they're performing relative to your own online sales for M\u00b7A\u00b7C? And then when do you expect M\u00b7A\u00b7C's performance, particularly in your own M\u00b7A\u00b7C stores, to start to improve in North America? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So M\u00b7A\u00b7C North America, specifically, as we said, is continuing to decline in the brick-and-mortar part of the business, meaning the department stores and our freestanding stores, and had a tremendous acceleration online and is performing very well in ULTA \u2013 in the store of ULTA as we had explained. So that's the mix. So in total, there is a sequential improvement of the trend of the brand. Also, the innovation of M\u00b7A\u00b7C is planned to improve gradually across the fiscal year to be more in tune for the key trends in the United States of what has been in the past. So our expectation is that the brands, in total, will stabilize over time thanks to the distribution balance, the drive of online, the improved innovation program, and having then in the base the periods that the brand had in the last year. So this gradually will put the brand in a condition to stabilize and then in the longer term grow again. As I said, in many other markets of the world, the brand is flying, and in China even doubling. So, in total, we continue to expect the brand to have the power to grow. But in North America, this will take a little bit of time to stabilize. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, provision of one-time impacts of the new U.S. tax law, and other adjustments disclosed in our press release. You'll find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web-site. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for the call. And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Dennis, and good morning to everyone. We delivered terrific financial results in our fiscal second quarter as our momentum accelerated. Our double-digit growth in both sales and earnings per share reflected broad-based gains across all regions and product categories. Sales rose 14% in constant currency and we leveraged the growth into substantial earnings improvement, boosted by cost savings and greater efficiencies. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% in constant currency. Our sales grew at more than twice the rate of global prestige beauty, enabling us to accelerate our market share gains. Fueling our success was a strong innovation program focused on supporting our iconic high-quality products and heritage brands that had demonstrated their power by driving strong loyalty and repurchase rates. Our performance caps a very strong first half. Based on these results and continued confidence in our prospects, we are again raising our full-year adjusted forecast. Many factors contributed to our achievements. Beauty was popular for holiday gift-giving and performed well across a variety of categories and channels. Our prestige brands, respected for their high quality and authenticity, offered compelling products that resonated strongly with global consumers. To fuel our performance in a balanced and diversified way, we focused our resources on priority areas within our multiple engines of growth. To expand our targeted consumer reach, we increased our investment in fast-growing countries and in channels where more and more consumers are shopping. We also further enhanced our digital capabilities and social media, created in-store displays that grabbed shopper attention, and implemented new technologies that modernize and enhance the consumer experience. Strong execution by our talented global teams was crucial to our excellent results. Our winning strategy fueled many areas of our business. Brands representing 95% of our sales achieved gains this quarter, while brands that accounts for half of our sales grew double digits. Each of our three largest brand, Estee Lauder, Clinique, and MAC, posted highest sales, and combined they grew double digits. Estee Lauder had a standout performance and Clinique and MAC delivered solid global growth. Sales increased in about 80% of our markets and in virtually all of our channels. Our strategy to focus on the best performing categories, leverage consumer shopping preferences, and offer innovative product and services, is clearly working. Both skin care and makeup, our largest and most profitable categories, generated strong double-digit growth, giving us two solid engines. The resurgence in skin care, that began about six months ago, accelerated, making it our best-performing category. Skin care was led by our Estee Lauder and La Mer brands, which posted excellent growth in every region of the world. We have driven our skin care growth by honing our research and development on innovations that support our hero franchises. We are creating products that provide instant benefits and long-lasting efficacy and appeal to large and fast-growing demographic segments, including millennial and ageless consumers. Skin care had remained the priority for us, even as global consumptions lowered, because we anticipated that demand would rebound. We took steps to strengthen our offering in many key subcategories and now our brands are benefiting from renewed interest. Our makeup strength came from several brands, in particular Tom Ford and MAC. Across our portfolio, makeup was strongest internationally. Our growth was also aided by incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA, which we acquired near the end of the previous year's second quarter. Our best-performing brands included our flagship Estee Lauder, whose sales growth accelerated, rising double-digit for the third consecutive quarter, making it a star in our portfolio. The brand sales grew across the board in every category, in every region, and in most markets, with particular strengths in online globally, in China, and in travel retail worldwide. Each success is due in part to executing a digital-first mindset and emphasizing social media strategy which has helped it reach more consumers, especially younger ones. In addition, Estee Lauder's focus on hero franchises and iconic products has paid off beautifully. In the first six months of this fiscal year, seven of the brand's top franchises increased double-digits. Estee Lauder is a prime example of a heritage brand benefiting from continued consumer loyalty, as it successfully innovates around its core products and engages consumers in modern ways. Although we continue to face strong competition or trial from upstart enemy brands, we believe many of them won't have the same power and the repurchase rate of our established brands and core products. Trial is often an investment, loyalty is the key profitability driver. Momentum also continued in our luxury portfolio, whose products were in high demand worldwide. As global economies continue to improve, we expect our luxury brands will continue to ascend. La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, each delivered double digit growth online, in travel retail, and in European and Asian regions. Some midsized brands, such as Origins, were also among our best performance and helped boost the skin care category. From a channel perspective, our online travel retail and specialty-multi businesses continued their rapid pace. Our sales in each climbed strong double-digits. Our online business rose sharply in every region, led by Asia-Pacific where sales nearly doubled. Tmall now accounts for the majority of our e-commerce in China and our sales on the platform surged. This was MAC first holiday season on Tmall, which helped lift its online sales in Asia sharply. And La Mer successfully attracted many new consumers on Tmall on Singles' Day. We expect to launch more brands on Tmall this fiscal year. In North America, the key periods encompassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday were important drivers of our online business, and sales on our brand sites and on retailer sites grew strongly. Mobile continue to be a key component, with sales rising more than 70%, and usage of mobile live chats was 5x greater than last year. With this key shopping period becoming a global event, our online teams in each market created locally relevant offers to drive growth. We continue to roll out more brands online internationally. Our products are now available online in 38 countries, which approximately is one quarter of the market where we have brick-and-mortar presence, giving us plenty of opportunity for expansion and future growth. Travel retail growth came largely from Asia as well as from our five largest brands in the channel, all of which rose strong double-digits. Our investment in emerging markets as well as a rise in the number of Chinese tourists helped fuel the improvement. Investment in the biggest local markets not only drives demand in those markets, but also results in demand in travel corridors. We gained share with Chinese consumer across all corridors, and also in skin care in the European region with the increasing number of Brazilian travelers. We have continued to expand our less distributed brands into more airports, and a wider portfolio provides a stronger foundation. Even with greater distribution, the larger majority of our growth this quarter came from like-door increases. We are benefiting from our efforts to increase conversion among travelers, which encourages more of them to be biased. To this end, we implemented several new capabilities. These included improved shopper insights, better merchandising, and enhanced digital marketing throughout a traveller's journey. We expect continued strong growth in the channel, both short and long-term. Solid passenger growth is expected to continue, particularly from Chinese consumers who are driving global luxury consumption. This specialty-multi channel continues to enjoy strong traffic. Some of our brands are positioning themselves where a growing number of their target consumers are shopping. So they are entering select specialty-multi retailers globally, and we are broadening their consumer base. Many of our brands, such as MAC and Estee Lauder, also have the power to bring new consumers to the channel, like what is happening for example in availability in the U.S. Our brands have had terrific success and they have expanded their targeted worldwide reach in the channel. Some examples from the second quarter include Jo Malone which launched in Sephora in France and Italy, Clinique added more doors with [indiscernible] and Boots in Korea, MAC opened in MECCA in Australia, and Too Faced deepened its presence in Sephora internationally. Our freestanding stores are growing internationally but results have been mixed by market. We continue to focus on productivity and open new ones where distribution options are limited. Some brands are experimenting with retail stores format in strategic new ways. Estee Lauder has continued to refine its store concept and experienced strong sales acceleration throughout Asia. Recently, it debuted in a new store in Milan, it's first in Western Europe, as part of a selective rollout in the region to strengthen brand awareness. Tom Ford chose London as the location of its first beauty-only store, designing a space that combines luxury with technology, and it's had positive early results. In a new concept, MAC and Bumble and bumble created a full-service makeup and hair studio in Dallas. Now, let me catch on our regional performance. Asia-Pacific posted the largest percentage gain. In China, we generated superb growth across categories and channels. Basically, every brand grew double digits in China, led by MAC and Tom Ford, whose businesses more than doubled. Estee Lauder is our biggest brand in China and it posted stellar growth. Our business in Hong Kong continued to recover and we achieved double-digit sales growth, making our best performance for a second quarter in the last five years. This was driven by a strong rebound in local consumption as well as a greater number of inbound Chinese travelers. Successful holiday programs and hero products accounted for a large portion of purchases. Most countries recorded growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and among the strongest was Italy where our sales grew at 5x the rate of prestige beauty. We also grew well in Benelux, the Balkans and the Nordic countries. We faced a slower market in the U.K. and challenges in Germany due to a decline in some brick-and-mortar stores. The Middle East continued to be disabled as lower retail sales caused the stocking. In our emerging markets, investment we have made in distribution, digital marketing and other areas have been effective. In total, these countries grew sharply. The best performance outside of China included India, Turkey, Russia and Brazil. We will leverage our investment during the next phase of acceleration in these markets, which are poised to continue expanding. Our sales grew solidly in North America, fueled by incremental sales from our newness brand, Too Faced and BECCA, and strong online results from retail sites and our brand sites. We are still challenged with the slowdown in U.S. brick-and-mortar department stores and although our business in them declined, there was improvement from the first quarter. Our brands helped drive traffic to stores, with influencer appearances and special events. During holidays, our gift sets were well-received. At Clinique, thanks to desirable product at sharp price points, the brand recruited more consumers than the previous year and also drove basic business well. Estee Lauder annual Blockbuster gift set sold out in the U.S. before the end of the season. Social media has become the most effective and significant vehicle for our brands to communicate with consumers. We are skilled at working with relevant global and local influencers to generate engaging content and drive traffic. Tom Ford, for example, launched a popular lipstick collection in Shanghai with an event for celebrities and influencers. This approach drove significant growth on the brand's digital channels, generated millions of engagements, and was featured on Vogue China online. These sorts of activities across our brands have helped the Company to continue to lead in social media. For the quarter, we were again the top Company among prestige beauty brands in earned media value in the U.S., accordingly to drive dynamics. Staying ahead of the curve, our brands are exploring new technologies to enhance the consumer experience. Estee Lauder collaborated with Google to offer voice-activated night time skin care advice over Google Assistant, extending High-Touch into their home. We are also bringing breakthrough technology into skin care and foundation products. Our innovations are accelerating and we are excited about scientific advances in new products that we believe will help fuel our momentum and continue our share gains. Overall, global economies are healthy. We should held continue driving consumer demand. Asia and emerging markets are projected to show strength. With upcoming tax cuts, the U.S. economy is expected to accelerate. We should continue to benefit from greater consumer spending online, but believe brick-and-mortar retail in the U.S. will continue to be challenged. Against this global backdrop, we are also cautious about the potential risk of political and social challenges, including Brexit. As we focus on driving growth, we are also intent on creating greater cost savings and efficiencies. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is on track, delivering initial positive benefit and allowing faster resource and talent reallocation to our biggest priority and pivots. By creating stronger leverage on our higher sales, we expect to sustain our earning progression. In closing, I want to thank our global teams whose hard work, challenger spirit, and incredible performance have resulted in many successes to celebrate this quarter. We couldn't be more proud of our talented workforce and their passion for excellence in execution. The combination of our superb results and the new U.S. tax legislation give us an opportunity to invest in our workforce by accelerating benefit enhancements and other rewards to help attract, retain and motivate employees around the world. We expect to solidify our plan in the coming months. As we look to the second half of our fiscal year, we are on solid footing. Importantly, we are optimistic about the state of global prestige beauty and confident in our continued leadership. To fuel our momentum, we plan to invest in the categories that are accelerating, continue driving our multiple engines of growth, and become even more efficient and productive as we embrace new global opportunities. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracy. Tracey T. Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning everyone. Before we review the financial results and expectations for the balance of the year, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the implications for our Company of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We believe the legislation allows us to build on our strength. We are a significant employer in the U.S. and a net exporter, with our headquarters here in New York City, and manufacturing, research and development, and distribution facilities in Minnesota, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Tax Act will provide us with greater flexibility to deploy our cash more efficiently around the world and certainly here in the U.S. This further reinforces our already strong capital structure, high return on invested capital, and effective deployment of our resources. The reduction in the U.S. statutory rate supports the continuation of the downward trend we have already seen in our global effective tax rate over the past few years. It will also allow us to realize better returns on our recent strategic acquisitions and minority investments. In the second quarter, we recorded three one-time items related to the new tax legislation which we consider nonrecurring. The first is a charge of $325 million, equal to $0.86 per share, related to a tax on historical foreign earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S. The effective tax rate is 15.5% for liquid unrepatriated earnings generally held as cash and cash equivalents and 8% on earnings that have been reinvested in foreign operations. The cash impact of this tax is payable over eight years. The second is a charge of $51 million, equal to $0.14 per share, related to the re-measurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets at the lower statutory rate. The third charge of $18 million, equal to $0.05 per share, reflects the establishment of a net deferred tax liability for withholding taxes related to the expected repatriation of certain foreign earnings. It is important to note that these charges, the combined impact of which is $394 million or $1.05 per share, are provisional and may require adjustment within the allowable one year measurement period. The tax bill is complex and the final impacts may differ from these estimates due to changes in the regulatory interpretation of the Tax Act. Now regarding our global effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, it is estimated to decrease to approximately 24%. This takes into account the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate as well as our geographic mix of earnings and the year-to-date impact of the change in accounting for share-based compensation we discussed with you last quarter. Additional provisions of the Tax Act become effective for us in fiscal 2019. We are continuing to review these impacts, which include additional provisions affecting taxes on our foreign earnings and the loss of certain deductions. Including these impacts, at this time we estimate that the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate could be between 23% and 24%. Overall, we have a smaller effective tax rate benefit than some other companies. The increased flexibility in liquidity however provides greater strategic support for our long-term sustainable growth. We expect further clarification on the tax legislation as the remainder of the fiscal year progresses and we will update you on the expected tax rate for fiscal 2019 in August when we also provide you with our guidance for the next fiscal year. As it relates to cash and cash investments, at the end of December we had $3.4 billion of cash and liquid investments outside of the U.S. The ability to repatriate our global liquidity when needed could provide additional financial agility to an already strong balance sheet. We will seek to maximize those repatriations in the most efficient manner, if not all of the cash is available to immediately repatriate to the U.S. As our cash needs in the U.S. generally exceed our cash generation, the greater access to our global cash reduces our reliance on debt to fund seasonal working capital, dividends, and other priorities. Our strong balance sheet has provided us with financial flexibility to fund our growth opportunities and our capital allocation strategy has generated strong returns on invested capital over the past several years. Our priorities for capital deployment to drive shareholder value remain unchanged and include, first, investing in our business to support our profitable growth strategy, strategic acquisitions that we believe can earn a strong return on invested capital for our shareholders and enhance our global position in prestige beauty, and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders via a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Now, I'll move on to our financial results for the second quarter. I'll remind you that my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the U.S. tax legislation which I just discussed. Net sales for the second quarter were $3.74 billion, up 14% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. This outstanding performance was broad-based across our business. Every region and most countries contributed to growth, with exceptional performance in Asia Pacific and travel retail. Every product category grew, led by a strong resurgence in skin care, double-digit growth in makeup and fragrance, and solid results in hair care. Incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 2 percentage points of this growth, which means our organic growth accelerated this quarter to 12%. Our gross margin declined 40 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. The unfavorable impact of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions was 55 basis points, which was partially offset by supply-chain efficiencies of 15 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 70 basis points. Higher investments in advertising and promotion expense were more than offset by lower selling expenses, which reflected both our channel mix shift and our ongoing success in reallocating resources through Leading Beauty Forward as well as productivity improvements and indirect procurement [indiscernible]. As we indicated last quarter, the change in the timing of stock compensation expenses adversely impacted operating expenses in the second quarter and is expected to have an additional impact in the third quarter. Operating income rose 19% and operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 20.9%. Our effective tax rate this quarter before restructuring charges and the one-time charges from the tax legislation was 24.4%, a 450 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. The rate improved primarily due to a favorable geographic mix of earnings as well as the impact of the lower U.S. statutory rate. Diluted EPS of $1.52 increased 25% compared to the prior year and grew 23% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.03 of favorable currency translation. The strong EPS performance reflected the continued outstanding results from our Asia-Pacific and travel retail businesses, our innovation success in skin care, and the momentum in expense management and cost savings programs. We are obviously pleased with our first half result, with our net sales increasing 14% in constant currency and diluted EPS rising at more than double the net sales rate at 30% in constant currency in our first six months of the fiscal year. And our free cash flow nearly doubled as well as we generated $1.45 billion in net cash flow from operating activities in the first half and invested $263 million in capital expenditures. We used $398 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares of our stock and paid $267 million in dividends. So now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Given the strength of our first half performance, we are again raising our full-year guidance. We expect continued strong execution to drive performance in our second half as well, even as our growth comparisons become more difficult. Too Faced and BECCA are now in the base year of comparison and will therefore be part of our organic growth going forward. We are also comparing to the strong acceleration in growth in China, Hong Kong and travel retail that began in the second half of last year, and we are slightly more cautious on the brick-and-mortar retail environment in North America and the U.K. And it is always worth noting that as a global enterprise, there will continue to be a number of macro and geopolitical risks, which are outlined in our press release and which Fabrizio referred to as well. That said, we are raising our sales growth expectation for the fiscal 2018 full year to 10% to 11% in constant currency. This includes approximately 2 points of growth from the incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA. Currency translation is expected to benefit reported sales growth by 2.5 percentage points, reflecting weighted-average rates of $1.19 for the euro, $1.33 for the pound, and 112 for the yen for the fiscal year. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and our cost savings programs have excellent momentum and continue to evolve. For example, we continue to reallocate resources to strengthen our capabilities in global digital marketing, which amplifies our ability to connect more directly with consumers. We've also made progress streamlining some of our global functions. We expect to continue to maintain this flexibility to invest a portion of the sales leverage in savings, into our brands and markets where we have experienced strong momentum as well as areas of strategic importance, while also expanding our operating margin. We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.27 to $4.32 before restructuring and other charges and the one-time charges associated with tax legislation. This includes approximately $0.15 of benefit from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 19% to 20%. At this time, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% for fiscal 2018. This reflects the blended U.S. statutory rate of 28% from the new U.S. tax legislation, which was effective as you know January 1. For the fiscal 2018 third quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 9% to 10% in constant currency. Currency translation is estimated to add approximately 3 percentage points. EPS is forecasted to be between $1.02 and $1.04 before restructuring charges. This includes an approximate $0.06 benefit from currency. Our expectations for double-digit growth in both sales and earnings per share for our fiscal year reflect the strength of the execution by our talented global teams and the investments we have made, focused particularly behind successful innovations. We will continue to support our abilities to invest in our growth priorities as we also continue to deliver cost savings and expense leverage with our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. All of these elements position us well in the context of accelerating economies around the world. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Altobello : [Indiscernible] that U.S. was down about 3% excluding acquisitions, and it sounds like at least in brick-and-mortar stores things are a little bit better but still not positive yet. So, if you can give us that number, what U.S. was up ex-acquisitions, that would be great. And then secondly, how fast is the market in China growing and how much are you outgrowing that market? Tracey T. Travis: So the U.S. was slightly down ex-acquisitions, and we talked about some of the successes that we had in the U.S. with our holiday programs which we felt very good about and some of the challenges as well as it relates to brick-and-mortar in the U.S. Online was up strongly in the U.S. and globally as well. So, mixed results in the U.S. And again, our teams are working quite well with our retailers to try to accelerate growth in the second half of the year and beyond. China? Fabrizio Freda : On China, China market was growing double-digit, the total market, and we are growing much, much stronger than the market, much stronger than the market. So we are gaining market share in China, and in quarter two was our strongest share market gain in a given quarter in China. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Congrats on the results. I was just following up, I understand the tough comparison that Tracey had mentioned, but embedded in your guidance for the fourth quarter it seems like you are decelerating EPS to about 6% at the top of the guidance. So, I was hoping to get some clarity perhaps on you reinvesting some of the gains that you had in the year into more advertisement or innovation, how should we think about the balance of profitability I should say, because definitely I understand the tough comparisons, so if you can elaborate I would appreciate. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : As we say, we are delivering, we plan to deliver our margin growth goals for the fiscal year in total. But in the second semester, we are planning to invest on our strengths. And so you mentioned advertising, in absolute terms advertising will increase significantly, particularly in the digital areas in the influencer global strategies and with focus in the markets where there is momentum. So we are investing on strengths. And advertising would also increase a little bit, slightly in terms of percentage of sales. But we are also investing in technologies which are driving our business drivers. We are investing in reinforcing our analytics, which are driving our ability to make choices on the business that I believe this quarter proves they are becoming sharper and sharper every time. We are investing more in the key markets where we see momentum and in subcategories where we see momentum, and obviously on our key brands and hero products and the hero product franchise strategy that we are pushing, which is working so well. And we will continue to invest online where we see strong growth both in the area of our brand dotcom and in the retailer dotcom with all our partners. So, we will continue to invest in our strengths and we plan to solidify and make sustainable the strong accelerated growth trends. Andrea Teixeira : Fabrizio, this is very helpful. You mentioned digital. So the question that we all asked back in the last call was about Amazon. So you mentioned that it wouldn't be included, if anything, this fiscal year. How do you feel, like because you are increasing investments in digital, are you feeling that is going to be a decision that will remain independent, basically you will remain independent in your digital investments in terms of channel? Fabrizio Freda : Yes, we are not changing our strategy. We continue to invest in our brand dotcom, in our retailer dotcom, and in the platforms where we control our assets and our destiny. Andrea Teixeira : On a first party basis, yes, okay. On a third-party basis, I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Russell Miller : This is Russ Miller on for Nik. We wanted to ask on Leading Beauty Forward. Are you seeing any specific new opportunities that perhaps you did not see initially? Tracey T. Travis: Great question. Yes, we actually have seen new opportunities. So there's been relative to Leading Beauty Forward we launched almost two years ago now, and I think I have mentioned and Fabrizio has mentioned on previous calls, we've gotten quite a bit of engagement throughout the organization for the program and it's allowed us to move forward in a lot of areas as it relates to changing some of our organization structures to be a bit more efficient and more leveraged as well as bringing new capabilities into the organization along with reducing costs. So we have added some programs to Leading Beauty Forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Good morning and congratulations. I had a couple of questions. First, just trying to understand, on the BECCA and Too Faced in the quarter, they contributed a couple of points of growth. I think the plan initially was for 3 points. I know it's not significant, but was there anything that changed versus what you expected with the competition? And then, Fabrizio, for you, if you talk about reinvesting in expanding some of these newer brands like a Too Faced internationally, can you just help outline for us what the intermediate roadmap can look like there? Fabrizio Freda : I think I can answer the two questions in one. Basically we are still in line with our plans on Too Faced and BECCA and we are very happy of how these brands are performing within our portfolio, and particularly they are filling one of our strategic priorities, which is to increase our market share in the specialty channel globally, and this is really, really working. In terms of how the plan changes, the plan changes continuously, our big strength is the agility to adjust the plan when we see market variation. So in that sense, Too Faced has been growing less than what we originally thought in the U.S. and we have been accelerating on the contrary the growth internationally more than what we thought, and that's why in the short term it is likely different impact on profitability because the international expansion is slightly more expensive than the North America expansion. But those are variations of agility within the overall plan, which we are very happy with. Erinn Murphy : Okay. And then if I could just ask one for Tracey on the gross margin, now that you are lapping acquisitions, could you just help us think about the back half outlook, what are you seeing in terms of input costs versus some of the supply-chain efficiency opportunity you've been delivering on? Tracey T. Travis: So, it's a great question. We don't expect to see the year-over-year reductions and negative impact on our gross profit margin now that we are lapping the acquisitions in the second half of the year. We do expect some increases in input costs as well. There will be a bit of a delayed impact from that, but we certainly are mindful of fuel prices going up and the impact that that could have on us, as well as a few other input costs. But in general we are expecting slight favorability in our gross margin for the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Maybe turning back to China, I was just hoping you could just compare the same-store sales trends that you saw in the second quarter to those that you saw in Q1, because I think they were up over 30% in the first quarter, I'm just trying to figure out how they compare. And more broadly, I'm just wondering if you would characterize demand in China as sort of comparable on a sequential basis or whether you are seeing actually signs of further underlying improvement, obviously adjusting for the seasonality, because I think we are all just trying to understand how sustainable the strength that you're seeing in China is when we normalize it out over the next 12 to 18 months. And maybe perhaps as you comment on that, you could just expand on how much benefit you think maybe the categories been receiving this year from the lower import taxes, and then Tracey, maybe just tactically whether you see any benefit in the third quarter of this year for maybe a later Chinese New Year? Fabrizio Freda : I mean to answer your China expectation is a difficult question to answer in the long-term, but we believe that double digit growth is sustainable. That's basically the bottom line. Prestige beauty has been growing double-digit in China in the past five quarters, and to your question, is accelerating. We see the market in quarter two was stronger and our performance was stronger than previously, so the reason acceleration. What is driving this acceleration, yes, there's been an impact on the duty reduction on the pricing in the country that we all have executed, and this probably is past what's happening in the market and building the consumption. And that is not only that, it is also the digital economy and the impact of social media is strong and is getting better and we are getting very good in executing this. Our team in China is executing in a fantastic way and a lot of the great results have to be attributed to their talent in executing our programs. The other aspect is pretty simple, we are not increasing number of cities and we are not increasing distribution in quarter two in a very big way. The majority of the growth has been same-doors. And the other interesting aspect is that China is leapfrogging the model of many other big markets like United States. In which sense? In the sense that the department store, the brick-and-mortar is still very focused in high-traffic areas. For example, we are only in 170 cities. Today we serve consumers from 650 cities because the remaining cities we serve it via online. That's why in China online is already 27% of our sales in quarter two, which is making the growth in China pretty productive and the ability to make it sustainable in my opinion better. So, in a nutshell, we believe that double-digit market growth should be relatively sustainable, obviously subject to shorter up and downs, and we believe we have a very solid position and this solid position should continue. Tracey T. Travis: And regarding Chinese New Year, it is a few weeks later this year than it was last year. So we do expect to see slight, both from anniversarying a stronger acceleration last year as well as on a later Chinese New Year this year, a bit of a mitigated growth in the third quarter from China because of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong, Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Can you talk about how many countries some of these brands that are on fire in, like Too Faced, Tom Ford, how many countries are already in and how much more opportunity there is? And then in terms of e-commerce, how does the mix of your sales differ versus brick-and-mortar, is it more skin care heavy versus makeup, is it new customers or existing, or is it a consumer who is trying something new or existing who is replenishing, and as more consumers move online, how do you expect that mix to potentially shift? Fabrizio Freda : I'll start from the second question. So, our online business is strong across, but the strongest categories are skin care and makeup, and the business has a slightly higher percentage of replenishment and repurchase than the brick-and-mortar, which means that is obviously that the growth on online of hero products or franchises that have good loyalty is very important, is very strong. Said in our way, a strong position online allow better loyalty and better repurchase, so allow brand to be stronger and more profitable over time. In terms of the global distribution of brands? Tracey T. Travis: So, Olivia, we still have quite a bit of upside. Too Faced in particular is still largely a U.S. based brand. We have started the plans to rollout internationally, and given the potential that we believe the brand has, actually are accelerating those plans over the second half of the year and into fiscal 2019. Our most broadly distributed brands are Estee Lauder and Clinique, and as we said, Estee Lauder has experienced double-digit growth in the second half. So, distribution certainly is a factor in growth, but also strong consumer engagement, strong innovation also can drive even a more broadly distributed brand to grow, as we are seeing with Estee Lauder and Clinique grew as well this quarter, as did MAC. So we have with our 30 brands quite a bit of flexibility. We talk about multiple engines of growth and we've certainly built that over time from a Company standpoint, both brands, regions, and obviously channels, and we are executing against that, I think as you can see from our quarter results and our year-to-date results. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, but to give you a general perspective on digital distribution, some of our brands today are in one-tenth of the distribution of Lauder and Clinique, some other in one-fifth. So, if the benchmark will be Lauder and Clinique, there will be infinite opportunity for the distribution. But the reality is that we have a different distribution target by brand and some brands, particularly our luxury brands portfolio, will be eased and will continue to be less distributed and more focused and more selective than our broader distributed brands. So, it's a complex portfolio and it's very selected distribution by brand that is what we are aiming, but the key point is there is further opportunity of distribution in our portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason Gere : Nice quarter, guys. I guess one question that will kind of dovetail into the second, maybe if you could talk just about the working capital improvements that you saw in the quarter, the free cash flow, how we are thinking about that going forward? And then when we think about the proceeds of free cash flow while we are lapping Too Faced and BECCA, where do you see, and I wouldn't call them holes in the portfolio, but where you can continue to strengthen the portfolio including maybe opportunities if there are any tail-brands in the portfolio to divest, just how you are thinking about where the portfolio could be maybe a couple of years from now? Tracey T. Travis: So, on the working capital, thank you for recognizing that we did have improvements in working capital, both in terms of our inventory days to sell and certainly payables also. So, we continue to have many strategies across the organization to improve working capital and we expect that to continue over the next few years, ongoing improvements in working capital. As it relates to our capital allocation decisions, and I talked about some of that in our prepared remarks, but our M&A strategies, we certainly feel very good about the portfolio we have. We have identified some whitespace areas that if the right assets become available, we given our strong balance sheet and strong cash flow would certainly entertain those acquisitions if they have the right return on invested capital. Fabrizio Freda : And our M&A strategy is pretty articulated and we have also minority investments that may become available in the next year, so which are already past of our articulated portfolio strategy. And so, our priority is fielding our strategic opportunities and doing it only with brands which are ready for doing that, which are strong enough for doing it, and obviously which are available at the right level of return on invested capital, and this will continue. So how do we see our portfolio in the long-term? Stronger, better, and better covering all our key strategic opportunities to help us deliver the real ultimate goal of sustainability, which is a multiple engine growth, well-diversified portfolio which is covering the key long term opportunity that we analyze and envisage with our complex strategic process. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Congratulations from me on an amazing quarter. On China, I was wondering how many consumers you think you are actually reaching, in the sense of how many are buying your product today versus five or six years ago, and how much of your growth do you think will come just from middle class Chinese increasing and entering into your price points? The second point on that is, for many brands we've seen local competitors get stronger and eat away market share, but it actually seems like the reverse is happening even with Korean skin care being maybe less fashionable than it once was, if you could just comment on that? And I'm sorry but a final one, what are you doing in bricks-and-mortar to renovate the stores, where are you having success with that? Fabrizio Freda : So, a lot of questions. How many consumers in China? Frankly, our business in the last year has been growing exponentially, and so we touch probably 5x, 10x the amount of consumers that we've been touching two years ago, depending where you start the benchmark. So, the growth is exponential. And what I want to \u2013 rather than a number that frankly will not be the right way to answer, but conceptually what's happening is two things. There are more and more consumers which are entering quality products among the Chinese consumers, they are going for quality. And going for quality they choose more and more many of our brands and particularly our hero franchises. And then there is a great repeat purchase which is increasing. So, it's not only more consumers, which was the heart of your question, but it's the same consumer using more of their total usage with high-quality products in our portfolio. As you know, Chinese have a very intense regimen of products in skin care, and so they use depending obviously by person up to seven, eight products of skin care per day. So the more you can penetrate that regimen, the more the growth is there and exponential. So, we are acting on two levels, yes, growing the number of consumers, but also growing the penetration of the portfolio usage of each consumer. The second thing is the growth of consumers in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities, this is exponential. And the reason why it's accelerating, as explained before, because even if the physical distribution is not reaching these consumers, the online distribution is, and so there are more and more consumers, millions and millions of consumers get more and more access to our products via the online distribution, and this is very, very important. And that's why we focus so much on quality of products, on safety of products, on the amazing hero franchises, because at the end it's not just conquering a consumer for one time, it's conquering a loyalty and a repeat purchase of satisfied consumers, and that's what makes the business sustainable in China like in any other emerging market. Then you asked what we do on brick-and-mortar, what we do, we renovate. Tracey, do you want to cover that? Tracey T. Travis: Yes, we are continuing to renovate our freestanding stones. In fact, as we said in the prepared remarks, one of the big focus areas for the Company is improving the productivity of our freestanding stores. So, in some of the MAC stores for instance, we have converted them to open style. We are testing out services in freestanding stores and investing in capital as it relates to that. So there is continued remodeling in addition to opening stores, new doors, primarily in EMEA and APAC, and really the focus on renovations in the U.S. in terms of some of the tests. Operator : Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : I just want to confirm a few things to make sure I understood it correctly. The first one is on the top line implied guidance for Q4. It's about 5%. Are you okay with that or are you saying that you are going to invest more to boost that number? I understand a tough compare but I just want to make clear what you said. Secondly, BECCA and Too Faced, it was expected to be 3% of the growth, it was 2%. You kind of addressed this a little bit in one of the previous questions. But what is the underlying growth of BECCA and Too Faced today? Is it still in that kind of 70% to 80% range? And one more, maybe those two I'll let you answer and then I have one more. Tracey T. Travis: So, in terms of Q4, you're correct that the implied growth is in the mid to high single digits for Q4, and we are anniversarying a very strong Q4 from last year, Ali. We will continue to invest in Q4 in higher advertising and promotion, more in Q3 than in Q4, but we have a tremendous amount of momentum as we have indicated in certain markets and behind certain innovation and we'll continue to invest for the balance of the year against that. Fabrizio Freda : And on this I just want to clarify just the process that we go through. We analyze this, we analyze our risks, our opportunity in this 5%. There is a lot of our point of view on the base, as Tracey explained, the base period and the risks which are in front of us, including some risks specifically in the U.S., Bon-Ton announcement and many other things which are in this number. But any way, our teams are always charged to beat our estimates. That's just the way we work. So, to answer your question, are you trying to beat this number, yes, every time. That's exactly the way our organization works. We are trying to mitigate the risks and better perform on our implementation. In terms of BECCA and Too Faced, no, they are not growing 70%, if that's the question, and they are growing more in line what the expectation will be over the long term. In the calendar year 2017, it was our first calendar, they grew double digit, and that was what we wanted. And then by month, by quarter, up and downs depending on competitive environment. I think that's why we are doing faster than what we thought also on these two brands the creation on multiple engines of growth, meaning the internationalization of the brands and the acceleration particularly of the online platforms of the brands where we have plenty of opportunity of improve and accelerate. So, we are going to invest and focus on creating more engines of growth also on those two brands in the next step, as was originally planned, but faster than originally planned. Ali Dibadj : Okay, thank you. And then my last question was just around SG&A. Clearly it's good it's down again 70 basis points, I feel less down than it has been and I totally remember and get the share-based compensation comment, but if you could help us kind of figure out the components of that underlying the SG&A reduction, and in particular if it relates at all going forward to a comment you made just at the end, Tracey, of employee benefits and reward plan we are thinking about and we'll give more detail, you said that in your prepared remarks? Tracey T. Travis: Yes, so clearly we are exploring some options, as Fabrizio said, as it relates to employee benefits and that is embedded within our guidance. But in terms of the full year SG&A, what I indicated was we are seeing a tremendous amount of growth from travel retail as well as online, so just mix obviously impacts our selling expense. And beyond that, we have done a fair amount of work in terms of selling effectiveness, both to provide our selling teams with the tools to enhance their productivity as well as making sure we've got the right investment for the volume growth that we are experiencing across different channels that have selling in them. So that is the largest leverage, if you will, of expense. The other is employee productivity. So, we have also leveraged our G&A expense as it relates to employee productivity. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I had a question on prestige beauty in the U.S. and the growth you are seeing currently and your outlook for the category as well as the consumer this year, and then if you guys could frame that for us given the slowdown we are seeing in mass beauty, that would be helpful. I guess I'm trying to understand if it's realistic to assume the prestige beauty category growth could accelerate this year and curious to hear how you think about the opportunities for increased purchases and possibly up-trading given the health of the consumer. Fabrizio Freda : So, I'm not sure exactly what the question is, the U.S. growth, what we expect about prestige beauty in the U.S. So, the overall prestige beauty market in the U.S. is solid and we expect this to continue to be solid and possibly to accelerate because of the new consumption trend that the consumer is setting. So, the overall consumption is positive and accelerating. Is more where the consumption is happening? And the consumption is happening more and more online. And so we see very good performance of the retail dotcom of most of our customers, including department stores which are having excellent performance there. We see a strong growth of our brand dotcom. We see some great performance in some specialty retailers. But where we still see the traffic not picking up for beauty in the level we would like is the physical distribution of certain retailers, particularly in the area of department stores. And we see some potential changes, like the recently announced change of the Bon-Ton department store chain, that will impact store closures and reallocation of resources. So, the market is solid but the physical retail environment is subject to continuous evolution and challenges. And so, since we have an over-proportion exposure to the physical department store distribution in the U.S., that's where our prudence on the estimate for that part of the market comes from, not from the consumption. The consumption is relatively solid. Operator : We will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Tracey T. Travis: Thank you everybody for participating in our call. And again, we are pleased with our results and incredibly pleased with the performance that our teams generated in the first half of the year, and we look forward to the second half of the year. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, thank you, thank you to everybody and thank you to our teams. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2018 Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir. Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, provisional one-time impacts of the recently enacted U.S. tax law, and other adjustments disclosed in our press release. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our excellent performance continued in our fiscal third quarter, building on the momentum we generated in the first half of the year. Our strong growth was broad-based across all regions and product categories, which produced double-digit increases in both the top and the bottom lines. Sales rose 13% in constant currency, about double the robust pace of global prestige beauty, and we gained share. We leveraged our higher sales into even greater profit growth, aided by further cost savings, efficiencies and lower tax rates. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17% in constant currency. With these better-than-expected results and confidence in the fourth quarter outlook, we are again raising our sales and EPS guidance for the fiscal year, which should make our performance one of our best in the last decade even in the midst of high competitive environment. Our global success came from bringing our brands into high growth markets, channels and retailers, and attracting consumers with compelling innovations, high quality products and social media activities. We have been able to devote increased investments to our digital activities as a result of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which has freed up resources from other areas. Today, all our brands are amplifying their digital communications and aligning with inspiring influencers. We have reengineered our financial structure to make this happen, and our results this quarter are proof of our ability to capitalize on positive industry trends. Our winning strategy is centered on activating and accelerating multiple engines of growth. As our business flourished around the globe, we continue to support the momentum of our fastest growing brands, countries and channels. They are gaining greater traction, as we develop more growth engines in each area. We opened new doors in consumer preferred channels and retailers, and closed less successful ones. Our results reflect skilled execution, improved analytics and our increasing agility to take advantage of opportunities quickly, effectively and respond to trends faster. Consumer interest in beauty and access to products is expanding in established and emerging markets. This trend is evident in our third quarter results, where virtually all our brands grew on a global basis. Many rose by double-digits led by our luxury tier, skin care focused brands and the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand. Many of our mid-sized brands have grown so strongly in recent years that they are now leaders in their respective categories in prestige beauty. Jo Malone London for example is a top brand in high-end fragrances. La Mer is number one in luxury skin care. Tom Ford is a leader in luxury makeup and Aveda is highly ranked in natural prestige hair care. All these brands improved in the third quarter, further solidifying their positions. Sales at each of our largest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and M\u00b7A\u00b7C grew globally. Our established brands are winning because they are changing, innovating and appealing to new and younger consumers. The most brilliant example of this transformation is our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, and we intend to apply its playbook to other brands. Like many of our mid-sized brands, our big brands are also prestige beauty front-runners. Est\u00e9e Lauder is a global leader in prestige skin care. Clinique is number one in prestige beauty in the U.S., and M\u00b7A\u00b7C is top ranked in prestige makeup worldwide. Est\u00e9e Lauder was again a standout in our portfolio. Sales climbed strong double-digits, reflecting the brand's strengths across skin care and makeup, as well as in many markets and channels, illustrating it increasing global appeal. The brand's success stems from the high quality of its product customization to consumer needs by region, strong repurchase rates especially amongst its hero products, and a focus on engaging consumers through digital and social media. Clinique growth improved, led by gains in skin care, which rose in every region. The brand's makeup and fragrance business also increased with particular strength in European region. M\u00b7A\u00b7C global sales increase reflected strengths in Asia and travel retail. Several of M\u00b7A\u00b7C top global doors were in travel retail location in Asia, boosted in part by visitors to Korea for the Winter Olympics. Several factors drove our skin care acceleration. Asians are large users of skin care, and our business in that region was robust. In addition, more millennials are purchasing skin care products, and our innovation in hero products were well received, including newer ones like masks. This is a trend we had anticipated, and therefore, we are well positioned. Many of our brands' hero products continue driving our strong performance. Clinique new Moisture Surge 72-Hours Auto-Replenish Hydrator was first introduced in North America in December, and the franchise nearly doubled there this quarter. In the past two months, the new moisturizer has been rolling out internationally and it's helped lift Clinique Moisture Surge franchise by over 50% fiscal year-to-date. In Asia/Pacific, Clinique hero products comprise about one-third of its sales, driven in part by strong Moisture Surge growth. Clinique is gaining share in moisturizers in many large marks, including the U.S., UK, France and Spain. Est\u00e9e Lauder launch last July of Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix has helped solidify the brand leadership in the eye treatment subcategory, which is a critical recruitment area in skin care. Our makeup sales were solid, but consumers demand is leveling off after several years of exceptionally strong growth. Our top performers were Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Tom Ford. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brands gained share globally in makeup, largely driven by Double Wear foundation franchise. We are supporting Double Wear with a wider range of shades and forms such as Cushion Compact to address the needs of consumers worldwide. M\u00b7A\u00b7C enjoyed growth internationally and has been well received as it enters new channels and retailers. It was our first brand to launch on ASOS in the UK, an exciting online platform that is especially popular with millennials, and M\u00b7A\u00b7C successfully reached new consumers. Its recent NICOPANDA collection with the edgy fashion brand has been a big hit. Too Faced global growth was mainly driven by success in specialty-multi doors in Europe and Asia, and it has gained share internationally. The brand grew at a slower pace than in recent quarters because of tough comparisons with the prior year as lower makeup category growth in the U.S. We expect Too Faced also will return to significant growth in the U.S. next quarter with roll-outs of new products and target expanded consumer reach. Turning to our geographies, sales rose in about three-quarters of our markets. Asia/Pacific was our strongest engine, where nearly every country posted growth and most brands grew double-digit. In China, we achieved another quarter of stellar double-digit growth and gained share. Skin care, the predominant category, rose significantly. Yet, at the same time, our makeup business doubled and fragrance was sharply higher. All major channels posted strong growth, driven by online and specialty-multi, which more than doubled. Our investments in China are creating even greater awareness of our brands among Chinese consumers, especially as we intensify our social media campaigns. Through our own brand sites and third-party sites, we can reach millions of consumers in more than 500 Chinese cities who desire our products, but don't have access to a physical store. This is evident in our online sales, which accounted for nearly one-quarter of our Chinese business. Outside of travel retail, our strength in Europe, the Middle East and Africa was led by Italy, where our local currency growth far outpaced the market. Across the region, several emerging markets including Turkey, Central Europe, India and Russia posted double-digit gains. The Middle East, however, continued to be challenged. In the U.S., our brands generated stronger sales online and in specialty-multi retailers. But in total, our business declined slightly as a result of continued challenges in some brick-and-mortar department stores and free-standing stores. As the physical retail landscape continues to change, most recently with the unfortunate news of Bon-Ton's liquidation, our business will be impacted in the short-term. Longer term, however, fewer stores should provide a healthier environment, as sales continue to migrate to experiential retail and to online. We are working with retailers to strengthen our brands' assets on their websites, where we are seeing good growth, as well as the experience in brick-and-mortar stores to increase sales in both areas. Looking at our business by channel, nearly all posted improved results. I will highlight two of our most vibrant. Travel retail generated momentum in every region due to increasing demand for our brands worldwide and outstanding execution by our organization's teams. The channel had strong retail growth in Asia, double-digit gains in the U.S. and Canada, and retail sales in the European region outpaced the local market. Our eight largest brands in the channel rose double-digits at retail and skin care accelerated sharply reflecting positive global trends. Travel retail results are driven by our investments in key local markets that are fueling our conversion efforts in airports. We launched our seasonal fragrance brands and Too Faced and BECCA in more airports to meet growing consumer demand. We are seeing the clear success of our high-end fragrance strategy in the travel channel. Fragrances are an important category in travel retail, and our luxury fragrance portfolio is already a strong growth engine. Most of our travel retail growth came from like-door gains. Starting in June, there will be more than 30 new flights a week between China and Europe, which is expected to help increase passenger traffic. Numerous growth engines are driving our online business, which once again climbed sharply. Sales grew double-digits across all platforms, regions and categories. Even as our online business has become significantly larger, we are sustaining our momentum. In Asia, our online sales doubled led by Tmall in China. M\u00b7A\u00b7C's first Super Brand Day on Tmall delivered terrific results. One of M\u00b7A\u00b7C's most popular products is lipstick, and it sold approximately 180,000 during that brand day. In March, we launched Darphin on Tmall, our eighth brand on the platform with promising initial results. Our retail dot-com business grew double-digits in every region. In the U.S., we had excellent retail sales on department store sites. Retail sell-through on Macys.com grew 30%, and the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is the number one beauty brand there. Social media is becoming an integral part of our brand dot-com business. By offering unique content and easy-to-use functionality, we are making them competitive destination sites and even more useful for consumers. We launched seven more brands dot-com sites internationally, including Origins sites in France, Sweden and Hong Kong. Our digital-first mindset continues to influence everything we do. Our brands are finding new ways to engage consumers by using big data to inform trends, paired with the right influencers and create impactful content. To stay at the forefront, we are adding digital talent, leveraging new technology like augmented reality, monitor real-time campaign analytics across all brands and directing more advertising spending to search influencers and mobile-first videos. In the last call, we discussed our intent to enhance the company benefits and invest in our workforce to help attract and retain the best global employees. As a first step, we are improving our family-related benefits for our diverse employee base in the U.S. This includes an expanded parental leave for all employees irrespective of gender and enhanced benefit around adoption, child and elder care, and enhanced flexibility when employees return to work. Our new policies are among the most comprehensive in the U.S. and underscore our commitment to family values and work-life balance. We plan to share additional benefit announcements in the coming months. I want now to spend a moment discussing a situation which we disclosed in our press release this morning. We recently learned that some testing related to certain products advertising claims had been intentionally altered for some time by a small group of employees. We became aware of this when an employee brought this to our attention through our internal escalation process. This clearly does not meet our standards, and we immediately launched a comprehensive review of our product advertising claims support, which is ongoing. It is \u2013 this is not a safety issue. All of our products are completely safe. Our ingredients remain of the highest quality and consumers can continue to use the products they know and love with confidence. As we undertake this review, we expect that many of our claims will not change, but others will. Some changes may be minor and others could be more significant, and we will make any necessary changes as quickly as possible and bring this area up to our high standards. We have resolved this testing issue by now, so that claims for new product launches will not be affected. We are investing in strengthening our talent, resources and independent validation to ensure that this does not happen again. This matter does not reflect our strong commitment to our consumers or the integrity that is at the heart of our company. We are sorry this occurred and we take full responsibility for this matter. We will continue to address this in a way that reflects our values and our high standards. So, we are proud of our many successes this fiscal year and confident about our future. We believe our broad brand portfolio, strong innovation, global reach, amazing people, greater channel diversification and agility to take advantage of new opportunities position us well to continue outpacing the industry. Our focus on being financially disciplined will help us further fuel our multiple engines of growth to continue our momentum. We are extremely pleased with our results and are on track to deliver outstanding sales and earnings gains in fiscal year 2018. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I remind you that my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the new U.S. tax legislation. Net sales for the third quarter were $3.37 billion, up 13% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Once again, our performance was broad-based across geographies and product categories with exceptional strength in the Asia/Pacific region, travel retail and online channels and in the skin care category. Our gross margin improved 40 basis points to 79.8%, driven primarily by a favorable comparison to the inventory step-up in the prior year period post the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were consistent year-over-year. Higher investments in advertising and promotion of 110 basis points and stock compensation expense of 50 basis points were offset primarily by lower selling costs. Operating income rose 21% and operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 17.4%. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 22.8%, a 490 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. This reduction was driven primarily by excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. As a result, and as a reminder, provisional charges related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be finalized within the allowable one-year measurement period. Diluted EPS rose 30% to $1.17 compared to the prior year and grew 17% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included approximately $0.11 of favorable currency translation. The higher-than-expected EPS primarily reflected better sales growth, a slightly lower tax rate and more favorable currency translation. For the nine months year-to-date, we generated $1.93 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, a 54% increase over the prior year due primarily to higher net income and improvements in certain working capital items. We invested $368 million in capital expenditures, repurchased 5.5 million shares for $676 million, nearly double what we spent last year, and paid $407 million in dividends. Now, let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full-year. Global prestige beauty is a vibrant category that continues to grow. With the outstanding performance we've seen year-to-date, we are again raising our full-year guidance, as Fabrizio indicated. We expect continued strong execution to drive performance in our final quarter, although our fourth quarter comparisons are the most difficult against the strong growth in the prior year quarter, and we remain cautious on the brick-and-mortar retail environment in North America and the UK. We anticipated some risk for Bon-Ton in our previous estimates and our current guidance reflects the new reality. Furthermore, there continues to be a number of macro and geopolitical risks that could disrupt the positive trends we have seen. That said, we are raising our sales growth expectation for the fiscal 2018 full-year to 11% to 12% in constant currency. This includes approximately 2 points of growth from the incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA in the first half of the year. Currency translation is expected to benefit reported sales growth by 4 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.20 for the euro, $1.35 for the pound and \u00a5110 (24:29) for the yen for the fiscal year. We are maintaining a degree of prudence in our outlook as we work through the review and retesting of some of our product advertising claims. Nevertheless, we are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.38 to $4.42 before restructuring and any other charges and adjustments. This includes approximately $0.22 of benefit from currency translation. It also includes an estimate for accelerated claims review and testing, consumer call center support, changes to some of our product communications as necessary, advisory fees and other costs related to the advertising claims review. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 20% to 21%. For the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency. Currency translation is estimated to add approximately 4 percentage points. We expect to increase investment substantially behind advertising and promotion and select brand expansion, reflecting the increased flexibility we have from higher-than-expected sales growth and our desire to support a strong start to fiscal 2019. EPS is forecasted to be between $0.48 and $0.52 before restructuring charges. This includes an approximate $0.07 benefit from currency. With two months left in the fiscal year, we remain encouraged by the momentum in global prestige beauty and our ability to execute our strategies effectively to exceed that growth. Our outstanding organic sales increase reflects the thoughtful investments we have made in innovation, advertising and promotion, digital and talent development. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Lauren. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I guess for a couple of years I've been interested in the question of the impact of channel mix on profitability and seeing that as a long-term positive. My sense is that Leading Beauty Forward is still kind of in like a net investment mode, but I still would have expected to see I guess better operating leverage this quarter just given the magnitude of the upside to top line. So, I was curious if you can talk a little bit about why we didn't see that. Were there may be some expenses accounted for this quarter related to the advertising claims dynamic? You talked about wanting to start off 2019 strongly, if you're kind of putting some money to work today more aggressively than you maybe initially planned before the top line came through as strongly as it did? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Lauren. So, I'll start by answering that question. We have talked all year about our incremental investment in advertising and promotion. You're correct that Leading Beauty Forward this year, we did indicate that there would be some savings related to the program that we plan to reinvest, reinvest in capabilities as it relates to digital marketing, reinvest in some of our analytical capabilities which we've referred to earlier in the script, and other areas of capability for the future. So, that has been the result of some of the savings that we have generated from Leading Beauty Forward. We've seen a big step-up this year, and again, mostly in this quarter and next quarter, so the second half of the year, more investment in advertising and promotion than even in the first half of the year. So, that is also what you're seeing in the quarter and what you're also seeing in the full-year guidance. And we have done a terrific job, as Fabrizio indicated, of reallocating resources to invest in more advertising and promotion and other areas of investment like IT support for some of our consumer-facing activities. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I want to add, we are really in a transition period of using these resources to accelerate, but mainly advertising a new capability like digital, data analytics, ability to anticipate trends, new talent in these areas, improvement in retail. But the advertising piece frankly is very exciting. Yes, in these two quarters, quarter three and quarter four, we have a serious improvement of the investment and increase on the investment. This is aiming at obviously preparing hopefully the continuation of a strong fiscal year 2019, but is also the result of going from an era, where certain brands were advertised and others were not were mainly driven by their brick-and-mortar experience, to an era where every single brand will be leveraged by social media and in a way advertised. And in this transition, we are putting more advertising funds in every single brands, also the brands in the past had not a lot of advertising. The result of this transition is frankly a very promising acceleration of top line that will be leveraged, that will be leveraged better over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line from Michael Binetti, Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Tracey, there's obviously a lot of minutiae as go through the margins and the different reporting lines but \u2013 and you spoke a little bit about advertising, Fabrizio. But the 110 basis point step-up in this quarter, can you maybe help us think about the medium-term a little bit as far as \u2013 you said there's an \u2013 I guess a leverage point on the horizon. But could you walk us through whether you guys feel like you're getting \u2013 you're obviously landing it on the top line. But as we think about the medium-term and how that was a 110 basis point hold-back in the quarter, is the best strategy to keep spending that faster than revenue growth for the next year to keep playing offense? Or do you think in the next year, we start to see a leverage point on that line? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: I think in the next year, you will start to see that normalize more. One of the things that we have done this year, we have such great momentum behind terrific brand innovation like what we're seeing in Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer. Some of the expansion that we've done in our travel retail channel behind new brands in addition to the existing brands in the channel that we have taken the opportunity and we have some terrific social media programs as well. So, this was the year really to invest behind to capitalize on that growth. We don't expect that we will see deleverage in advertising and promotion on a go-forward basis. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, if I could just follow up quickly on the gross margin, nice inflection in the quarter. And I know you mentioned that there was some things in the compare on the inventory step-up from Too Faced and BECCA. I'd be interested in hear in how you think about the puts and takes on that over the next couple of quarters and then maybe what we should think about by geography or product mix and whether we can continue to see that kind of leverage flow through. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I mean one of the reasons we saw deleverage in the first half of the year was because of the comparison year-over-year with the non-comp and the acquisitions, and I think I did mention that we would see favorability in the second half of the year when our two acquisitions became part of our base. So, we \u2013 really, our gross profit margin is very much dependent on our category mix and our channel mix. And so, the real measure, if you will, of margin that you should be focused on is the operating margin, because mix does have a differential benefit on our gross profit margin mix. But you could expect to see certainly some level of expansion in gross profit margin on a go-forward basis, not perhaps what we saw in this quarter, because of anniversarying the inventory step-up, but some benefit in gross profit margin given the near-term programs that we're expecting to launch. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser, D. A. Davidson & Company. Linda Bolton Weiser - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah, hi. So, I was wondering if you could give a little more detail just on the margin performance in the Americas, because the profit was down about over $50 million year-over-year. I don't think that includes any charges in there. And you mentioned a comp issue, which I think you had referred to earlier. Maybe you could quantify that. But also you mentioned investment in social media and digital, I think. So, I was curious about that and what areas \u2013 like are you putting more toward the smaller brands that you've recently acquired or more towards some of the larger brands, which seem to be slipping a little bit in social media prominence. In particular GLAMGLOW is quite lacking in prominence on social media compared to some of your other even smaller brands. So, is that one of the areas receiving more investment? And then, on the bigger brands, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, Smashbox and Origins appear like they need a little more investment. So, could you talk about the investment side and then the comp issue there in the margins? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, Tracey will take the margin question. But on the advertising, basically the answer is yes. The short answer is we are increasing social media activities on our big brands and on our mid-sized brands and on some of our new acquisitions. Particularly, we are looking for accelerating this area. You mentioned GLAMGLOW, which actually is a brand which is doing very well behind these extra investments recently in the social media in the U.S. and in other areas of the world. So, our intention is to do that. As I said before, our intention is to make sure that also the brands that historically has been driven more by in-store activation and innovation that get driven by investment in the social media arena. And in order to do that well, we don't need only more money on the advertising line. The real big difference in going from a brick-and-mortar brand to a social media-driven brand is creative assets and the amount of talent in communication. And that's the areas where we \u2013 in each one of the brands you mentioned, we are making some excellent progress, and we will continue. The way we produce creative assets, the way we expose consumer to our creative assets, the way we involve and engage consumer in actually, in some cases, the generations of the assets is really changing, and that's very exciting. That thing will (36:24) produce better results over time as we learn how to practice on every single brand this new reality. And finally, on margin, Tracey? Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So, on margin, a bit of it is a step-up in advertising, you mentioned due to some of our newer smaller brands. So, we are investing more in advertising in Too Faced for instance and some of our other brands as well. We are investing a bit more in digital marketing as well in the U.S. I mentioned the change in accounting in stock-based compensation. That is also impacting the Americas segment. So, that is also a margin drag, if you will, on the segment for the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Probably a bit too early to talk about fiscal 2019 expectations, but I guess maybe looking at it sort of a different way. Any thoughts on what would impact global prestige beauty growth from current 6% to 7% levels and even up from the 4% to 5% that you were expecting back in August, and then anything that you were seeing that potentially impacts your ability to continue growing ahead of the global market? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So, obviously, today is not the day to speak about guidance for 2019. But to answer your question on the market is, so we believe that our above 5% long-term market growth potential is still the right estimate for the long-term, meaning that year-after-year, the 4% to 5% average that we quoted in the past will likely continue to be the reality in terms of what are the global forces that drive that. This is an extraordinary year. The 6% to 7% is happening in fiscal year 2018, we believe, is an extraordinary strong year. The reason why it's extraordinary is it's a year where there is the combination of very positive factors. One is the consumption in China has jumped as we see in the market. The social media boom that in the past was mainly on makeup is coming through also in skin care. That's behind the sudden reacceleration of skin care. The U.S. tax cuts give some push to the U.S. consumption. International passenger traffic for travel continues to increase. So, the combination of factors of accelerating all together is there. We believe this acceleration started at the end of last fiscal. Obviously, this somehow will normalize in the future, and that's why we continue to believe that above 5% growth is the current long-term estimate. As far as your second part of your question, we continue to believe that we will grow ahead of this 5%, and we say that 6% to 8% is our long-term algorithm. We are continuing to be behind that. And in some years like this one, we are growing double than the market, because many of our activities are coming together in a brilliant way. So, we are still confident our long-term algorithm is pretty strong and pretty right. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies. Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Tracey, a question for you on the balance sheet. I'm wondering if you can talk about your comfort level with stretching the debt load, what kind of leverage would you like to see over time in the model, just thinking about your M&A capacity over the next couple of years. Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Sure. We feel very comfortable with our balance sheet. As you all know, we've been very prudent in terms of managing our balance sheet, and the biggest acquisition that we've done from an M&A standpoint was last year with Too Faced, where we took on additional debt in order to fund that. We typically are in the 2 to 2.5 times range in terms of leverage. That's a comfortable position for us to be, certainly to maintain our credit ratings. But we certainly have more capacity than that. So, we are not restrained at all from an M&A standpoint in terms of doing further acquisitions. And given the strong free cash flow that we have, we certainly can fund all of the needs of the business. And certainly, we have our debt payments spread out in such a way that we can certainly manage the repayment of that with no problem whatsoever. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Fabrizio, could you comment on maybe the economic cyclicality? Particularly, if I look at the Europe luxury business or even the development of North America, it seems like a lot of the growth comes from \u2013 I guess how \u2013 maybe more simply, how does the development of your luxury portfolio relate to what's going on economically and what happens when the economy slows down? How has beauty changed in the past 10 years or not changed that makes the economy drive that high into the business? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, obviously, the global economy overall is stronger this year, and this benefits our high-end part of the portfolio. But what benefits even more our high-end part of the portfolio is the growing consumption in Asia. Asia, among the various regions, is the most oriented to the high-end of our portfolio. So, brands like Tom Ford or La Mer are doing very, very well there. And the new high-end fragrance portfolio that we have recently developed, which includes again Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Le Labo, those brands have huge potential in that region at the high-end. And so, we believe this will continue. Asia economically is on a roll, and we count on that. In the past years, which is also the other part of your question, what happened is when there was an economical crisis or an economical cycle, actually what suffered the most is the entry price point of the portfolio, not the high-end. The high-end part of the portfolio is the most resilient, because even during economical cycles, the wealthier part of the population tends to be the ones that suffer the least. And so, that is the reality. So, we believe that the fact that the high-end of our portfolio is solid, increasing and becoming bigger is actually an element that over time will mitigate volatility in our results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, guys. So, Fabrizio, clearly you're delivering substantial upside to your long-term top line algorithm this year. I was hoping you could just take a step back and discuss two of the key drivers behind that in terms of China and travel retail. You gave a bit of detail in your answer to Mark's question. But, A, just a review of what drove the greater-than-expected growth in those areas this year; B, have your long-term expectations changed at all looking out over the next few years in those areas with the outperformance; and then C, is there risk you could see an abrupt deceleration in fiscal 2019 with the difficult comparisons, et cetera? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, sure. First of all, there are several factors which are behind this acceleration. Let me mention at least some of which are among the most important. The first one is the fact that we are winning again of our big brands, and particularly our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, which is really growing at a strong double-digit everywhere in the world. So, this proves that the big brands, when big brands make the necessary changes and speak the language of the new generations and tailor like the Est\u00e9e Lauder has done by region their activity in a brilliant way, big brands are still a stronger proposition than small brands, because big brands have the tools in terms of money to spend, money to invest, quality of talent, global reach, level of consumption and level of awareness with the consumers. When they do the right thing, this becomes immediately impactful. And I think the story behind our Lauder brand shows that when we do good things, they become fast \u2013 very fast they become impactful on the business. And that's very positive news for us, and that's a big change versus what was at a certain moment the dynamics a couple of years ago. The second \u2013 and by the way, this is sustainable in our opinion. Actually, it could get better and stronger with the time. The second driver has been Asia and particularly China. Now, in China, what's happening is very interesting. What's happening is that the social media reality is making the awareness of these beautiful brands, innovation, propositions, idea and the conversation with the consumer is getting to a large majority of the population, because social media is very popular. And so, the conversation goes on in 600 cities, 700 cities, but the physical distribution is actually today the Lauder brand, which is the most distributed, is 117 cities. So, there are hundreds of cities where there is awareness, there is demand, there is desire and there is no physical distribution. And these hundreds of cities, the people can buy it online or during their travel, their travel within China or their travel outside of China. And that shows that is a big implication of the great results we are seeing on Tmall, on our brand dot-coms, in the online in general, in the travel within China of Chinese consumer, and obviously, in travel retail. So, this other thing which is happening in China, which is sustainable, is China has been for years mainly driven by skin care, and this is continuing. Actually, it's accelerating. But importantly, it's also driven by makeup and fragrance acceleration. So, our portfolio now in place in China is (47:39) leveraging its scale at full, while in the past was mainly a skin care discussion. That's another big change that is here to stay. And finally, the quality of our execution. We have an extraordinary China team that does an amazing job in China, and so the quality of our execution with our team in China is second to none, and we believe this is a lot of what is behind our success there. The other driver is travel retail. The travel retail is working. We are today the market leader in the combination of skin care and makeup that we call beauty. And with the recent activation of the fragrance business, which is huge in travel retail, we chose a niche, meaning we are now the leaders in what we call the high luxury artisanal fragrance, which includes brands like Jo Malone, Tom Ford or (48:38) acquisition. We have chosen really to leverage that piece of the fragrance market, because we believe that's where a lot of the future is, and we are making great inroads there. So, very solid. Our position is very solid, and we believe the trend of growth will continue to be there. So, this is another strong driver and is globally \u2013 is a good driver globally. Now, the reason behind this driver is that many of the emerging market consumers, Chinese, but well beyond Chinese, Russians, Brazilians, Middle Easterns are among the big purchasers in travel retail. So, our investments on our brands in these markets of origins of the travel is what really makes the difference. And again, we have an amazing travel retail team that is learning better and better how to convert travelers into purchasers at the airport. And so, this combination of investing in the market origins and learning how to convert in airport is really working for us, and we believe will be another strong driver for the long-term. So, we feel comfortable that this will continue. Now, said these, you were asking about 2019, 2020, the future. Obviously, the base period is becoming stronger and stronger. So, we need to imagine \u2013 even in these strong drivers, we imagine a certain normalization of the trends. But even in thinking of a normalization of the trends, we still believe there will be a lot of exciting growth opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Investment Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research : Hi. First thing on the product claims issue that you disclosed, it surprises me \u2013 number one, it just seems so un-Est\u00e9e-Lauder-like. So, does it reflect anything internally? Are you growing too fast? Do you feel like you've got the same level of control and corporate culture that you've always had? And what's the risk associated with that? I can't imagine consumers will care all that much, but it's interesting to me that you called it out so specifically. So, do you perceive any risk either in terms of your market share or sales trends or anything like that or any litigation associated with it? So, that's question number one. And then, question number two, I heard what you just said, Fabrizio, in terms of the Lauder brand and the investments you've made and how, when you love a brand, it grows. But I'm still just struck by the slowdown in the U.S. market. With all the incremental distribution in Ulta, with the strength in online, your U.S. department store business, is it down double-digits, is it down mid single-digits? It surprises me that that business isn't responding better to the stuff you're doing behind M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. So, if you can just address the U.S. department store business and maybe your outlook for that going forward, that'd be great. Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, Wendy, let me start with your question on what we've included as it relates to the review of the product claim \u2013 the advertising product claim issue in our estimates. So, clearly, I said in my prepared remarks that we're being prudent in the full-year estimate and the fourth quarter, as we are doing a review of the situation and making sure that as we look at some of the claims on some of our products to the extent that we have to do retesting, we are in fact doing that retesting and we're doing it in an accelerated way. And so, that certainly is incorporated into our Q4 expectations. So, there are some communication vehicles such as websites that have to change to the extent that we can't prove a claim. And to your point, we don't know at this point that these are \u2013 how many of the claims are impacted. We don't think that there are that many, but we don't know. So, we prepared ourselves at least in the estimate to be able to address this entire situation as quickly as possible, and we have advisory fees, et cetera. We certainly do not have any cost in the estimate related to any legal activity from this, as you indicated. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: And so, to continue on that \u2013 on the first question is \u2013 obviously, you're right. This is definitely not typical of Est\u00e9e Lauder. And that's why as soon as we learned that, we decided to act on it with, first of all, maximum transparency and maximum speed. We have decided to analyze the situation, retest and invest in retesting everything we have to retest to validate our test \u2013 our advertising claims. And in the cases where there will be a minor change to do or a more serious change to do, we will do it immediately and transparency communicating with our retailers, consumers and everyone, and we'll take care of that. Second thing we have decided to do to invest into improving our process in that area, first of all, and to be clear, as I said in my prepared remarks, we already fixed it. So, everything we are doing from now on is under control, and we have invested and fixed it immediately. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for squeezing me in. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Sorry. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Jason, can you hold on a second? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Jason... Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Fabrizio is still finishing his response to Wendy. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Oh. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, I'll go mute. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Sorry. I'll give you the word in a second, Jason. So, we are addressing every other aspect and checking for quality in everything we do, and we are further strengthening every one of our processes. So, we are acting on it fast, transparently, and making sure that while what has happened is not in line with our standards, I want to make sure that our reaction to what happened is fully in line with our standards and with our integrity. And that's what we have done. Now, the last part of your question here was the risks. As we say, we don't know yet how much of this will be the impact. As Tracey said, we have put all the impact of our actions into our estimate. But in terms of the impact on our business in a broader sense, we don't know yet, but we will know soon. And as we know, we will decide if this has an impact or not on our overall results. On your other question very fast on the United States, the situation in the United States is clear. We are very successful in our new distribution. We continue to win online, as I explained in my prepared remarks, also in department stores. We are doing fantastic in specialty-multi. Our brands are all growing there. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand by the way in the United States is very strong and growing overall. But particularly our M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique brand exposure to the brick-and-mortar department store in percentage of the business is still so big that it's very difficult to offset that decline with the growth of online and specialty for the time being. But this will change. It is changing. And things like the closure of Bon-Ton will accelerate this change. Bon-Ton had \u2013 we had the business with Bon-Ton, it was more than $50 million business in the past. So, these kind of changes are significant, and we need to recover this business in the other channels. Jason, back to you. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Are we good? Am I still here? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah, you are on. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Excellent. Okay, thank you. Hey, I guess I want to come back to the question on global category growth. If we rewind the clock the last couple of years, there's been a lot of consternation around potential market fragmentation, the rise of indie brands, the shift to online, shift to specialty-multi, where there's just clearly more brand assortment and more risk of brand fragmentation. But if we look at results from you, it was solid 13%; LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics 17%; L'Or\u00e9al Luxe 14%; P&G's SK-II on fire also, either your market growth rate either \u2013 materially understating market growth rate we're in a much bigger beauty super-cycle than the 6% to 7% range suggest? Or we're in a period where this fragmentation has gone entirely other way and we're concentrating growth within mega brands? Can you weigh in on your view of \u2013 I mean, clearly, you have a view of which side we're at, and that's the concentration of growth behind mega brands. If that's the case, what's driving it? Where are the losers? What's causing this rise of indie brands to maybe stall out and go the other way? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Jason, thank you for the question. I've talked to that in the past. I don't know if you remember. But first of all, I believe we are in your second camp, meaning the growth is 6% to 7%. That's what Euromonitor is publishing and that's what we believe is happening. But it's obviously a very special growth. I don't know many other consumer markets, which are growing 6% to 7%. So, definitely, we are in a booming of this industry, of the fact that particularly luxury cosmetics are driving, which means the first thing that is happening is consumers are trading up over time. So, the growth of the luxury part is much stronger than the mass. Now, this is true since 10 years by now, and we are driving it. And the big companies that you mentioned including ourselves are all driving that phenomenon with good innovation, great service. But what's happening particularly in this new world of social media, consumers are interested not only in the product as a commodity, but in the how to use the product, in the service attached to it, in the creativity attached to it, in the case of makeup in the artistry that comes with it, in the case of skin care in the new learning and new habit to do what the previous generation didn't know how to do like the mask boom around the world. So, there is a lot driven by novelty and a lot driven by what the companies are doing in innovation and creating new market. And then finally, there is all this growth of Asia and Asia consumers that are avid consumers of luxury beauty, and they are now getting wealthier and so they have better access. And finally, it's the access. Luxury beauty is at a click distance from any consumer around the world. In the past, people had to go to destination store, take the car, go there. So, there is a reason why this market is growing strongly. Now, why the big companies are growing so much better than the market, including Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, is because at the end, what really makes the market growth is repurchase. It's not trial. What is happening is the big competition of the many small brands is people try the product the first time because of the novelty. But there is no consumer that buys the second time a product unless was happy with that product. So, what we see in our brands, that while the trial game has become more competitive and is in a way more expensive to do, the repurchase game is still driven by product quality. Our repurchase numbers are going up despite increased competition. And so, the big brands, the successful brands, where product quality and great performance in the long-term are winning, are driving repurchase rates. And that's the reason why companies with strong brands, with strong research and development, with strong formulation capabilities, with strong product quality, have a chance to continue winning even in this more competitive environment in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Good morning. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. I have a bit of a follow-up question, the slowdown in growth of your makeup artist brands. You've stepped up spending. So, curious if you're starting to see a lift from the increased spend. For instance, did things improve for some of these brands by the end of the quarter and then into April? And then, I have a question on skin care. It's very encouraging that you're seeing the pick-up in demand among younger consumers that you mentioned, but curious to hear what your outlook is for this trend and how sustainable it is. And then finally, how do you think about the interplay of the two categories for this demographic and if you believe they can both accelerate or is there a risk that a shift from makeup to skin care could become more pronounced? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Okay. Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, let me start with makeup. Just to remind you that in the first half of the year, we had non-comp growth in our makeup category. So, Too Faced and BECCA obviously were in our results this year and not in the results the prior year. So, in terms of what we're seeing now given some of the investments that we're making, we are very recently seeing a slight pick-up in a couple of the makeup artist brands, and we are very encouraged by the strategies and some of the product launches, in particular Bobbi Brown with the new foundation launch and other brands as well. So, we are encouraged that we will see growth. But clearly, if you look just from a total category standpoint, skin care is growing faster than makeup. So, not just for us, but certainly for the category globally and in different markets. And then, in the interplay between skin care and makeup, Fabrizio? Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: Yeah. The interplay is \u2013 what's happened in the last years, as you obviously have seen, is that the social media impact in terms of the impact of social media communication, social media impetus started from makeup, and makeup has been driven and accelerated by the social media phenomenon for a couple of years. Now, it's happening also on skin care. Still a lower level than makeup, but it started happening more intensively also in skin care. That's what's behind the acceleration of skin care. And at the same time, some consumers start understanding that good skin care, just to take care of the canvas before you put the makeup on your face, is a great practice and make even your makeup work better. So, skin care is not an alternative to makeup in my opinion, but it's just preparing the canvas in a completely different way. At the moment, social media started clarifying this opportunity to \u2013 particularly to young women, we see a boom of skin care. Interestingly, the boom of skin care or the acceleration of skin care is mainly about younger people, particularly in Asia. So, it's not anti-aging which is accelerating. It's really the skin care for natural benefit for preparing the canvas. Skin care is a base to makeup. So, the skin care which is complementary to great makeup results. Operator : Your next question \u2013 the last question comes to us from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. So, I just want to go back to your commentary on the mid-tier department store challenges in the U.S. So, as you look at your remaining exposure there, how much would you say of your remaining base is still at risk? And then, as we look forward with the Bon-Ton headwind that appears to be going on right now and may, I guess, linger into next year, how do you think about recapture rates when these department stores close down? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.: So, we had a lot of closures of department stores in brick-and-mortar. Now, we had some Macy's closures last year. We had Sears in Canada. We have Bon-Ton now. We assume that the reduction on number of stores in brick-and-mortar will continue. And we believe this will be for us in the short-term a negative impact. But in the long-term, this could be actually a positive impact, because the brick-and-mortar will need to improve the experiential part of retail, which is here to stay and in my opinion is here to be very successful over the medium, long-term. So, we are working to improve the experiential quality of the strong brick-and-mortar and physical retail, and at the same time, we are focusing on leveraging the fast acceleration of online across every retail partner, and this is working. So, what will be the impact? As I said, depending by brand. On some of our brands, which are overexposed to brick-and-mortar department stores particularly in the country, we expect that this transition will take some time \u2013 is taking some time, particularly in presence of closures like the Bon-Ton situation now. On other brands, which are more focused on specialty and online as the way they started, this will not be the case. And depending on how different brands will do, the mix will have an impact. But as I said, I believe that we are in front. In the future, we are going to stabilize and then to restart growth also in the United States the moment that's balanced (01:07:26) by physical and online distribution and by destination stores versus experiential stores will be adjusted. And I personally believe this will be a very booming and interesting retailing environment at the end of this transition. Operator : Okay. That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rainey Mancini. Please go ahead, sir. Rainey Mancini : Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Stephane de la Faverie, Global Brand President of Est\u00e9e Lauder; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, the impacts of the recently enacted U.S. tax law, and other adjustments disclosed in our press release. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal year 2018 was an outstanding year for our company. By focusing on strategic priorities and investing in our multiple engines of growth, we delivered double-digit sales and earnings per share gains in all four quarters. In constant currency full year sales rose 13% nearly twice the rate of global prestige beauty and diluted EPS increased 24%. This was the ninth consecutive year of records sales and one of our best performances in the last decade. Coming off an excellent fourth quarter, we expect our strong growth to continue in fiscal year 2019. Our success last year was broad based with higher sales in every region and every major product category which is consistent with our long term growth strategy. What made our performance particularly strong were our over achievements in Asia and in Skin Care globally. We strengthened our hero franchises with new products, expanded in fast growing brand building channels and invested in the areas that touch younger consumers. Our growth was all the more remarkable given the challenges we faced. Competition intensified from new brands and business models and those closures and weak traffic affected certain brick-and-mortar department stores in the U.S. and UK. On a macro level, Brexit and other tensions caused the greater political and economic volatility. Our results speak to the soundness of our strategy, the sustainability of our business, and the resilience of our organization. Sales climbed globally in virtually all our brands. La Mer reached an exciting milestone. Its net sales topped $1 billion for the first time. We have now four brands in our portfolio whose net sales have crossed the billion dollar threshold and each grew globally. Est\u00e9e Lauder had a stellar year achieving record global sales and growing an outstanding 22% in constant currency, demonstrating its huge worldwide appeal. Est\u00e9e Lauder generated strong growth in Skin Care and Makeup and across markets and consumer groups. Stephane will elaborate in a few minutes. Clinique's growth was driven by solid growth of Skin Care gains particularly moisturizers, its largest subcategory and its hero franchise Moisture Surge. Clinique had strong gains in many emerging markets and in Asia where its hero franchises grew more than 30%. Clinique continued to diversify its distribution and TMall became its largest door in Asia. We are upbeat about Clinique's outlook. Its Skin Care nutrition program this year will be especially strong and leverages strengths of growing consumer interest. M.A.C delivered global growth, which was supported by strategic investment in advertising to accelerate the brand in fast growing areas of Asia and travel retail. This winning strategy is similar to the approach we took with our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand several years ago which is paying huge dividends for the brands now. M.A.C sales in China more than doubled and its first full year on TMall it was the top selling prestige makeup brand. Although M.A.C continued to struggle in North America, we actively began turning it around by expanding it further in specialty multi retail in the U.S. and Latin America strengthening its innovation program. We are optimistic about M.A.C's future expected to deliver stronger global growth in fiscal year 2019. Many of our small and midsized brands grew sharply and several are on track to become billion dollar brands within the next few years. We grew our recent acquisitions with successful new products and expanded distribution which attracted new consumers. We increased our focus on innovating in Skin Care, believing there will be a resurgence in the category. As consumer demand grew we were ready with products for different concerns and age groups and products with instant benefits which made the compelling visuals online. Our effort resulted in Skin Care being our fastest-growing category fueled by La Mer, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, as well as Origins and GLAMGLOW. Maximum categories growth came from Asia Pacific and travel retail where we gained share. Many of our brands also grew in North America. La Mer creative digital content and authentic storytelling helped to build greater awareness which led to share gains in every region and China, importantly in markets where we can accurately measure more than half of La Mer consumers were new to the brand. Est\u00e9e Lauder's strong sales boosted its global rankings to number one in prestige skin care and number two in total prestige beauty for calendar year 2017. Our makeup business remained healthy with Tom Ford and Est\u00e9e Lauder leading the growth along with M\u2022A\u2022C in Asia. Our newness brands Too Faced and BECCA expanded internationally, mostly in specialty multi retailers and Too Faced opened its first freestanding store which is located in London. With improving retail trends and greater presence in direct to consumer channels Too Faced grew 22% in fourth quarter and with strong innovation it is well positioned to post strong results globally in the year ahead. Our luxury artisanal [ph] brands continue to drive our fragrance growth led by Jo Malone London and Tom Ford which introduced successful scents in open new doors. Jo Malone solidified its position in the UK, its home base where it gained share. Just last week Jo Malone launched on TMall and sales during the first few days have been very strong. Combined, our newest brands Le Labo, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, and By Kilian contributed already approximately one quarter of the total category growth. We have a neater growth in Hair Care as we tapped into the natural wellness trend with its plant based product. Successful launches and hero franchises such as Invati played a key role. Our innovation was concentrated on fewer, bigger launches in the largest subcategories with a focus on supporting our best selling hero franchises. This strategy produced terrific results. Sales from our top 30 new skin care product and initiative rose more than 30% from the year before. We continue to expand in the fastest growing prestige channels, travel retail, online and specialty multi. In travel retail, in calendar 2017 we gained share across all categories, became the top ranked beauty company in Asia Pacific airports and reinforced our global leadership position in Skin Care makeup. Our successful travel retail strategy benefited from higher global passage and traffic. Chinese travelers are important shoppers in the channel and their increasing travel helped in its growth across our portfolio. Once again our online business strived, with our own brand side retailers, size and third party platform all growing that we have more than 430 million visits to our brand dot com sites this year and these sites have become more than just point of sales. They are also influential editorial [ph] platform and equity building vehicles. During the year we opened 200 new online doors globally and launched ecommerce inside new markets. We truly are a global enterprise and nearly three quarters of our markets generated gains. As sales outside North America had expanded our international business has become one of our best growth engines, now accounting for nearly 70% of our sales. Emerging markets around the world have been a significant growth vehicle. Sales in our emerging markets jumped 24% and accounted for 15% of our total business. We intend to continue to invest in many of these markets in fiscal year 2019 laying the ground for our continued growth as the purchasing power of the middle classes continue to increase. Our Asia-Pacific region generated the fasted growth led by an acceleration in China and the resurgence in Hong Kong. Our China business grew rapidly in every category, every channel and in virtually every brand. China net sales well exceeded $1 billion for the first time. The country's prestige beauty growth is benefiting from heightened interest from Gen Z a millennial consumer with considerable spending power and an appetite for high quality luxury products and we tapped into that opportunity. For example, more than 40% of Chinese consumers who were new to La Mer are in their 20s. We had mixed results in Europe, Middle East, and Africa with strengths across developed markets like Italy as well as several emerging markets like Russia we gained share in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe, but sales fell in the Middle East where our results were also affected by our decision to adjust inventories of multiple brands. The UK market slowed as Brexit affected consumer confidence, which primarily impacted certain brick-and-mortar departmental freestanding stores. We increased investment in new winning channels. Online was a bright spot driven by retailer.com. M\u2022A\u2022C was our first brand on Asus [ph], an online company that caters to younger consumers. It was followed by GLAMGLOW, Too Faced and others. Prestige beauty was buoyant in North America and in each major category we had brands that gained share in the U.S. La Mer in Skin Care, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Too Faced in Makeup and Jo Malone and Tom Ford in fragrances. We have been building our distribution towards faster growing channels and the scales started to tip in our favor. Our incremental sales in specialty multi and on our brand.com sites were greater than the decline we experienced in bricks-and-mortar department stores. Our business trend in U.S. department stores overall showed improvement from the year before and our sales on their online sites are rising rapidly. However, total U.S. department stores sales declined mainly due to the liquidation of Bon Ton. Over the past two years we have successfully offset the loss of more than 150 million in annual net sales in North America from the closing of Bon Ton, Sears [ph] Canada and other department store doors. Despite these challenges we had growth in North America in fiscal year 2018. Our Clinique brand was the most impacted by the loss of Bon Ton and those in our other department stores doors. Nonetheless, Clinique recouped a large portion of the business by staying in touch with consumer emigrating them to other Clinique doors. In total, Clinique North America retail sales increased by focusing on fast growing channels, product categories and new consumer segments. Our strategic investment in advertising spending on all our brands helped get our products noticed. Now each brand has a digital presence and digital accounted for nearly two thirds of our ad spending, up sharply from about 50% the year before. People are the heart of our company and we announced our benefits to be loyalty and attract the best talent. We expanded our benefits around adoption, child and elder care, an awarded a special bonus to employees who don't receive equity-based compensation to recognize their terrific contribution. As we realign the company focus to strengthen our position in the areas that will lead future growth, we hired and developed talented employees with the skills needed in these new areas. We also began offering learning and training opportunity online through our LinkedIn Learning helping our employees build competencies in a variety of areas. We are proud that our commitment to our employees is being recognized. Our company was named the top rated workplace by the job site Indeed and recognized by Forbes as one of America\u2019s best employees for women. Fiscal year 2018 gave us a lot to celebrate, but we are now focused on the future. To that end, we updated our 10-year compass which identifies industry and demographic trends. These insights confirmed the strategic focus areas where we have invested to build growth and where we plan to continue over the next few years including skin care, online, traveling consumers, digital marketing and omni-channel retail. We will continue to seek growth globally among a more diverse and growing middle class, especially in growth markets like China and in our U.S. home market. We are the number one prestige beauty company in the U.S. which still remains the largest market and where we are focused on regaining share. We continue to build distribution in high growth channels and leverage better data and analytics to tailor our product assortment by retailer and by specific doors. This helps us address hyper local demand by having the right products on the right shelves with relevant messages. We forecast continued growth in our EMEA region with strengths in both Western Europe and emerging markets along with a return to growth in the Middle East. Our innovation pipeline is powerful and focused on hero franchises elevated packet [ph] and new technologies deployed against key sub categories. We expect this without our growth become more balanced across our four product categories. Fast moving technology innovations continue to enhance the luxury beauty experience and we are advancing features like Augmented Reality and voice assisted shopping which are gaining favor among consumers. Behind the scenes, we are focusing on improving our capabilities in data and analytics. Using cutting edge tools and techniques we are connecting data and insights to measurable actions across our brands. Now I want to update you on the review of certain testing related to product advertising claim support that we discussed in our last call. The review is ongoing and based on the review to date the company does not believe that this matter will be material. In addition, we are closely watching the evolving global issue concerning tariffs and trade including Europe and China important markets for us where we intend to remain focused on our long-term growth. We believe we will have some flexibility to address the potential impact of existing and proposed tariffs and remain committed to satisfying global consumers with our quality products. Our strategy is solid has been validated by our updated compass and should allow us to continue to deliver strong topline and double-digit EPS growth over the next few years. Our growth will be supported by Leading Beauty Forward which is projected to deliver greater savings than originally planned. We will invest a portion of the savings in area driving the next stage of growth including digital advertising, social media, talent acquisition, technology and other capabilities. At the same time, we are driving efficiencies throughout the organization and leveraging growth enhancing our profitability. Tracey will give you an update in a few minutes. Global prestige beauty is exciting, dynamic and fast growing with a proven successful strategy and brands and products that are coveted around the world we expect to continue to drive industry leading sales and gain share. I want to thank my leadership team and all the company global employees for truly remarkable results even in the midst of ongoing challenges. We look forward to delivering another year of strong top and bottom line results. I am happy now to introduce Stephane de la Faverie, Global Brand President at Est\u00e9e Lauder, who will discuss our iconic brands, stellar year and the strategies that have kept it relevant to the new generation. Stephane de la Faverie : Thank you Fabrizio and good morning everyone. I joined the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company over seven years ago and was honored to become the Global President of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand two years ago. Today 72 years after its founding our flagship brand is not only the largest in the company but one of the fastest growing as well. Est\u00e9e Lauder is stronger than ever and demonstrates that our authentic roots make the brand relevant for women of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities around the world. The brand strategy which is fully aligned with the company's 10-year compass has resulted in accelerating growth. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales increase culminating in growth at nearly 22% in constant currency for the full year. The brand gained share in virtually every market around the world. The main element of our success our focused on hero products, digital marketing, and social engagement and fast growing channels. Our winning strategy is also concentrated on the turnaround of our home market, the U.S., and the acceleration of our business as we serve and delight emerging middle class Chinese consumers around the world. The first element of our strategy is our focus on hero products which has reinvigorated the brand, generated strong double-digit growth in both skin care and makeup globally. Skin Care outpaced the growth of the overall brand for the year. The brand's largest franchise Advanced Night Repair has been growing high double-digit in virtually every market and channel. The July 2017 launch of Advanced Night Repair, Eye Matrix Concentrate has been a resounding success and helped solidify our leadership in the eye treatment subcategory. Everyone of our top-five skin care franchise is growing and addressing different consumer benefit and needs. Makeup grew at about the same rate as the overall brand enabling Est\u00e9e Lauder to gain share globally largely driven by our Double Wear foundation franchise. The collection has been supported by newly activated communications around a wider range of size and form such as Cushion Compact to address the needs of consumers worldwide. Our success in the recruitment and retention of all consumer age groups is evidence that our strategy to modernize the brand has paid off. Today Est\u00e9e Lauder consumers are about one-third millennial, one-third Gen X and one-third ageless. This mix puts us in a strong position to continue to win in all prestige channel and in our key product categories around the world. In addition, the brand global spokesmodel celebrates women of all ethnicity and ages to help the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand win in virtually all markets. Our newest face is a Anok Yai, a Gen Z who was born in Egypt of the Sudanese decent. She joins Millennial actress Yang Mi from China and our longstanding American model Carolyn Murphy to name a just few. The second part of our strategy is our focus on being a truly digital first brand. About two-thirds of our global media spend is in digital and social helping us to reach new consumer on platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Weibo, WeChat and TalkTalk [ph]. We are partnering with major digital and social players worldwide to leverage improved consumer insights and data to enhance our storytelling to connect in a deeper way with consumers and build campaign with even stronger returns on investments. In addition, we have activated the use of influencers. We have super influencers including our latest celebrity model Karlie Kloss and [indiscernible] our Digital Native Global Beauty Director. We utilize influencers in many markets and leverage our beauty adviser, who have been trained to become what we call Est\u00e9e micro-influencers. Taken together, the voice of the brand has been unleashed in a more authentic and powerful way. The strategy has helped us to better connect with younger consumer at the point of search and decision making which is done on social and digital platforms. And third, we continue to evolve our distribution in fiscal 2018 over 50% of our business came from fast growing channel, which includes specialty-multi, online and travel retail. In specialty-multi our expansion into Ulta in the U.S. has allowed us to reach younger consumers, many of whom are new to the brand. Today half of our consumers are Ulta millennials. Our global online business grew 60% and represent more than 10% of our total sales and even more than 20% in the U.S. and China. Online is growing from our own brand.com sites, retailer.com and third party platform like Tmall which allows us to connect with new consumers every day particularly in smaller cities where we have less physical presence, which makes our consumer reach extremely efficient. We are also experiencing a rapid acceleration in travel retail where our Tmall doing exceptional work to support the desirability and the equity of the brand by connecting with consumers throughout their journey, starting at home into the airport and at their final destinations. From a geographical standpoint, I am proud to say that net sales in every regions are growing, including a solid performance in North America for the year. In fiscal \u201918 the Estee Lauder brand passed 1 billion market retail for the first time in the U.S. and gained share in Makeup in 10 out of the last 12 months. In the U.S. we\u2019re the number one prestige beauty brand in over 350 department stores and the number one brand on retailer.com nationally. In addition we continue to hold top ranks in skin care and age specialist and foundation sub categories. Thanks to our laser focused strategy on hero franchises, online acceleration and the rapid diversification of our distribution, we gained over 1 million new U.S. consumers who are younger, more diverse, and more affluent than the average existing consumer of the brand. We believe we have successfully turned around the U.S. business and are poised for continued growth going forward. The Estee Lauder brand now generates 80% of its business outside of North America and we've been particularly successful in Asia Pacific. We continue to be the number one luxury beauty brand in the region led by exceptional performance in China. For the second consecutive year we were the only brand ranked as Genius by the L2 Research Firm which placed us as the top brand in Digital IQ. These performances are fueling our already strong brand equity and desirability with Chinese consumer around the world. In addition we continue to serve Chinese consumer with a deep understanding of their needs and diversity by creating relevant products and communication uniquely designed for them. Estee Lauder is also outperforming in the U.K. growing 5% in the context of the flat prestige beauty market. Our Double Wear liquid formation is the top luxury beauty SKU in the market. We also have strong momentum in our markets in our Europe and Latin America region, thanks to a consistent global strategy. Last but not least, as part of our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives, our teams around the world have been relentless in reallocating resources effectively to focus on consumer engagement activities while delivering increased profit margin to the company. We reduced certain selling costs by increasing productivity in profitable distribution channels, rationalizing non-profitable [indiscernible] and accelerating our distribution shift to less costly models. Our promotion expense has also been significantly reduced as a percentage of net sales. As a result, we dramatically increased our advertising spend especially in digital and in addition we continue to price in line with inflation and further improve our gross margin. In summary, thanks to a strategy aligned with the company, we believe our success is repeatable and sustainable. Our great progress in fiscal \u201918 was largely driven by same-store growth, no distribution expansion, as well as an increase in repeat repurchase from existing consumer, high new consumer acquisition, especially among younger ones and strong creativity and innovation. All of it taken together makes the Estee Lauder brand a sustainable and profitable growth engine for the company and at the same time demonstrates that big brand can grow fast while building desirability and exclusivity around the world. I would like to personally thank my extraordinary boss Jane Hertzmark Hudis, my amazing team, and my colleagues around the world for their commitment to the iconic Estee Lauder brand and to our success. And now I will turn the call over to Tracy. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Stephane. And I believe many of the elements of the strategy you just articulated are already inspiring the plans of our other big brands. My commentary today excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments including those related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the new U.S. tax legislation. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency unless otherwise stated. Starting with the fourth quarter, net sales rose 12% to $3.23 billion compared to the prior year, all regions grew with the largest contribution coming from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Net sales in the region rose 16% led by a strong double-digit increase in global travel retail. The momentum achieved in the travel retail channel reflects a 6% rise in international passenger traffic, share growth in all travel retail regions, as well as double-digit gains across virtually all of our brands. In addition to travel retail, the EMEA region also benefited from double-digit sales growth in Greece and India as well as solid growth in Italy, Russia and Benelux. This growth was partially offset by weaker results in other markets notably the Middle East, the U.K. and Germany. Our business in the Asia-Pacific region rose 24%. Continued momentum in China and Hong Kong, both with strong double-digit growth largely drove these results, which was broad based across brands, product categories and channels. We also achieved solid sales growth in Japan, Australia and Thailand. Net sales in the Americas grew 2%, Latin America rose 8% led by double-digit increases in Mexico and Colombia which were partially offset by a sales decline in Brazil. Sales in North America rose 2% as growth in Canada brand.com and specialty multi retailers were partially offset by continued softness in department stores including certain door and retailer closures as previously discussed. The continued rebound in Skin Care led product category growth this quarter. Skin Care sales grew an outstanding 26% with strong contributions to growth from innovation within key hero franchises such as Estee Lauder, the Estee Lauder brands Advanced Night Repair franchise, La Mer's The Moisturizing Cool Gel Cr\u00e8me and Clinique's dramatically different and Moisture Surge franchises. Origins and GLAMGLOW also contributed to the growth and all regions grew Skin Care sales. Net sales in Makeup grew 2%. Many of our brands reported higher sales. Estee Lauder benefited from the continued success of Double Wear foundation, Tom Ford Lip and Eye products drove growth in Asia-Pacific and travel retail, Too Faced launched Super Coverage Concealer and extended shades and its Born This Way Foundation line and La Mer launched its Luminous Lifting Cushion Compact in Asia. These gains were partially offset by declines from M\u2022A\u2022C and Clinique. M\u2022A\u2022C's outstanding grow in Asia in travel retail was offset by continued weakness in the U.S. and U.K. in bricks-and-mortar as well as inventory rebalancing in the Middle East. Sales of fragrances grew 9% led by the continued strength of our Luxury and Artisanal brands. Jo Malone\u2019s limited editions Blossom Girls collection was popular in Asia in travel retail and a variety of Tom Ford fragrances resonated across all regions. Le Labo continued its strong comp door growth and expanded its reach in the Middle East, Australia, Europe and travel retail. Our Hair Care sales rose 6% primarily driven by Aveda's launch of Invati Advanced, the professional color line Full Spectrum Demi+, and the relaunch of Cherry Almond Shampoo and Conditioner. Bumble and bumble\u2019s expansion in specialty multi retailers also aided growth in the category. For the quarter, our gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to the prior year due primarily to favorable pricing and mix partially offset by higher obsolescence and the higher cost of some new products. Operating expenses increased as a percent of sales by 110 basis points primarily reflecting the significant planned increase in advertising support behind digital activities partially offset by efficiencies in selling operations. As a result, operating income rose 3% and operating margin decreased by 90 basis points. Diluted EPS of $0.61 was 20% above the prior year and grew 11% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.05 of favorable currency translation. Now let me cover a few highlights of our full-year results. Net sales grew 13% of which incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions contributed approximately 2 percentage points, our gross margin decreased 10 basis points as favorable manufacturing costs and foreign exchange transactions were more than offset by the full-year impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisition. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 80 basis points primarily due to greater efficiencies in our selling model. We strategically redeployed these savings into digital advertising, social media and influencer outreach. Our full-year operating margin rose 70 basis points to 16.6%. This margin included 40 basis points of favorable currency translation and 20 basis points of dilution from the fiscal 2017 acquisitions. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and ongoing cost saving programs contributed more than $270 million in savings which helped offset the strategic investments we made to support future growth. The changes in our P&L reflect the accelerated restructuring of our cost structure to increase our flexibility to both reinvest in areas of profitable growth and to mitigate risk. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 22.3%, an improvement of 540 basis points over the prior year driven by excess tax benefits on share based compensation and the lower U.S. statutory rate. Net earnings grew 31% to $1.7 billion and diluted EPS rose 30% to $4.51. Earnings per share included $0.20 of favorable currency translation and at constant exchange rates grew 24% for the year. In fiscal 2018, we recorded approximately $193 million after-tax or $0.51 per share in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives. We are making remarkable progress on the program and have identified additional opportunities with existing initiative as well as new ones. We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 and complete them by the end of fiscal 2021. We now expect to incur charges of between $900 million and $950 million before taxes in aggregate over the life of the plan. Through this plan, we've established more efficient and effective shared services and procurement organizations which are generating savings and allowing us to invest in critical areas of the business for future growth. We now expect the annual net benefit before taxes to range from $350 million to $450 million which represents an improvement in the cost benefit ratio. This will afford us greater flexibility to meet our profit objectives while also continuing to invest for sustainable growth and manage additional risk. We also recorded three items related to the new U.S. tax legislation which we consider non-recurring. These charges the combined impact of which is $427 million or a $1.14 per share are provisional and are expected to be finalized within the one-year window allowed by the Tax Act. Moving on to cash flows, cash generated from operations jumped an impressive 43% to $2.6 billion, reflecting our outstanding earnings growth, improvements in our working capital management, and the benefit of certain one-time items related to tax refunds. We utilized $629 million for capital improvement primarily for consumer facing counters and gondolas, retail stores and e-commerce support, as well as supply chain improvements and IT. We\u2019ve returned cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace in fiscal 2018. We repurchased 6 million shares of our stock for $759 million representing a significant increase versus the prior year. We paid $546 million in dividends reflecting a 12% increase in our dividend rate, the ninth consecutive year of double-digit dividend growth. In total cash returned to shareholders rose 45% compared to last year. Overall fiscal 2008 was an outstanding year for our company. Our sales growth of 13% far exceeded our long-term target of 6% to 8% annual growth in constant currency and was enabled by our improved insight in analytics on where to invest. We delivered 50 basis points of organic operating margin growth in line with our objectives. Importantly, we did so well making strategic investments to build capabilities and support our brands for the long-term health and sustainability of our business. We delivered double-digit growth in earnings per share in line with our long-term targets. We saw 12 day improvement in inventory days to sell. We recruited new talent and invested in our existing employees to align our capabilities to future needs. So looking ahead, Global Prestige Beauty growth have been exceptional in recent years and we do expect it to rise in the range of 5% to 6% annually over the next few years, barring a significant political or economic macro event. Our goal is to grow at least 1 point ahead of the industry with possibly 1 percentage point of that sales growth contribution coming from acquisitions over the next three years. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative was launched two years ago is providing the fuel to innovate, accelerate changes to meet future demand, and engage effectively with consumers. We continue to target average annual margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points and double-digit EPS growth over the next three years. Capital investments have historically averaged between 4% and 5% of sales annually. We do expect this level to increase to between 5% and 6% per year over the next three years as we invest more to increase the capabilities and capacity of our supply chain, enable enhanced consumer experiences with our new technology and invest in our facilities to optimize some of our work spaces. We are dedicated to pursuing working capital improvement to free up cash particularly in inventory. Our progress in this area has been slower than expected. This was partially due to the complexity and shifting geographic mix of our business. Our strongest growth is coming from geographies further from our manufacturing facilities, increasing inventory and transit time. We now plan to reach approximately 165 inventory days to sell by the end of fiscal 2021. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the fiscal 2019 full year and first quarter. We are implementing the new revenue recognition accounting standard beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year. We will adopt the new standard on a modified retrospective basis. There are cumulative adjustments to retained earnings. This method does not require us to restate prior year periods. However, throughout fiscal 2019 we will provide a bridge between the new standard and the old one. The guidance we are providing today reflects the new standard, but we have also bridged to the comparable growth expectations we have for our business. The new rule will impact where we reflect certain costs in the P&L along with the timing of revenue recognition. As such, our sales and profit growth, as well as margins, will be affected. Additionally, our initial revenue deferrals based on this implementation will impact fiscal \u201919 results. The main impacts are the costs for certain promotional goods such as samples and testers will be reclassified from advertising and promotion to cost of goods. Certain payments to customers such as the cost of in-store demonstration will be reclassified from selling, general and administrative expenses to a reduction in net sales, and the timing of our revenue recognition will be impacted primarily by customer loyalty programs and certain promotional goods provided to retail customers. The overall effect on fiscal \u201919 is expected to be a reduction of net sales and increase in cost of goods and a reduction in operating expenses. This will negatively impact sales growth for the year by approximately 1 percentage point, decrease gross margins by 260 basis points, and decrease operating margins by approximately 30 basis points. Earnings per share growth is expected to be negatively impacted by 2 percentage points for the year due primarily to the change in timing of revenue recognition on some promotional programs. The changes in the timing of revenue recognition for certain promotional goods will also cause variability in our quarterly sales this year. We anticipate that revenue deferrals in the first half of the year will begin to be recognized in revenue in the second half of the year. For the year net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standards at the high end of our long term goal. Pricing and targeted expanded reach are expected to each contribute approximately 2 points to our growth and the strength of our existing business will account for the remainder. We expect growth to continue to be driven by Asia Pacific, the beginning of a turnaround in the Middle East and improvement in North America. All major product categories are expected to grow with the greatest contributions from Makeup and Skin Care our two largest categories. Currently translation is expected to turn unfavorable in fiscal \u201919 as the dollar strengthens. Based on June 30 spot rates at 1.16 for the euro, 1.31 for the pound and 6.63 for Yuan we expect currency translation to negatively affect reported sales for the full fiscal year by about two percentage points. We expect to continue to achieve cost savings through indirect procurement, AMP [ph] effectiveness and selling costs within our ongoing programs and from Leading Beauty Forward, which are expected to increase to approximately $350 million this year. Some of the savings will be reinvested in increased digital marketing and advertising to support strong growth as well as for the expansion of our smaller brands. Cost savings provide us with the fuel and the flexibility to both invest more in capabilities, advertising and brand expansion as well as deliver margin growth. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, additional provisions of the U.S. Tax Act become effective for us in fiscal 2019. We now expect that the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 24% which includes the impact of a lower U.S. statutory rate as well as our current estimates related to the provisions from the Tax Act that go into effect this year. The impact of the accounting for stock based compensation is not included in our estimates. Diluted EPS is expected to range from $4.62 to $4.71 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency and with comparable accounting we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 11%. In fiscal 2019 we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $2.4 billion, slightly lower than fiscal \u201918 due to the prior year one time benefits for tax refunds and the first installment of the toll tax. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $835 million or 5% to 6% of sales as discussed earlier. Our sales in the first quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10% in constant currency using comparable accounting for revenue recognition. Currency translation and the accounting change are each expected to negatively impact growth by 2 percentage points to 5% to 6% reported including both of these items. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.18 to $1.21 including dilution of about $0.04 from currency translation. EPS growth in constant currency in comparable accounting is forecast to rise by 7% to 10% for the first quarter. In closing, we are clearly pleased with our outstanding results in fiscal 2018 and are excited about the momentum behind our strategic initiatives. Global prestige beauty is a fast moving and competitive industry and the macro environment grows more volatile by the day. Our ability to adapt in this rapidly changing land landscape is a testament to our sound strategy and to our amazing people. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Great, thanks good morning and a lot of great content in those remarks. I guess my question first is on the U.S., you called it out being positive in the fourth quarter, can you talk a little bit more about the dynamics that you're seeing between the department stores and then the growth in particular you've been seeing within specialty multi and online? And then Tracey, as you think about the guidance for fiscal \u201919, what are you assuming for the growth rate within the Americas? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So on the U.S. we do see improvements, mainly coming from the strong retail.com of our department stores and we are encouraged also to see brick-and-mortar business in North America department store doing better than last year. However, in addition remember that we are facing the liquidation of 250 stores of Bon Ton that have significantly impacted our business. For perspective, Bon Ton just in the fiscal year \u201918 was for a $68 million in net and as I said we had to face the closure of the equivalent of $150 million in net of department store doors in the past two years, so this has impacted, but despite that we have been offsetting this with the improvement in retail.com of department store and by the very good performance that we see in specialty multi and in our online sites. So we are committing, we're really committed to continue collaborate with our department store and with our specialty multi-traffic to continue drive traffic. And also I want to say that we have and the Leading Beauty Forward, we have restructured our sales force and the new sales force has just been deployed early July and we have reduced the paper work and administration activity resulting in a 70% increase in consumer facing activity and product served and more tailored to each store starting this August. So we are pretty positive on what we're doing to turn around the business in the U.S. Tracey Travis : And as it relates to the Americas for fiscal 2019, we're expecting low single digit growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So first off Tracey, can you give us the impact to earnings from FX if you use spot rates today, I\u2019m estimating another $0.08, $0.09 of earnings impact for the full-year, does that sound like it's in the ballpark and then hopefully that's just the clarification question, so hopefully that doesn't count as my question. The broader one Fabrizio, I wanted to get your thoughts on the potential for tariffs on the U.S. beauty industry in China, you mentioned specifically you've assumed some impact in your fiscal 2019 guidance, so I was hoping you could be more specific there, and are you basically sort of assuming an impact just from already announced plans or are you assuming there may be some factors that emerge that are transparent today either directly or indirectly on consumer spending whatever it may be that have an impact on your outlook for fiscal 2019? Thanks. Tracey Travis : So on the currency, I'm not sure I picked up exactly on your question, but we expect a negative currency impact this year of $0.20 and obviously we experienced a positive currency impact in fiscal 2018. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. On the tariffs, so the tariff in China has not been yet implemented, it is only a proposal. So first of all it is not clear if the proposed tariffs will be implemented or not. But for information currently less than one-third of our products that we sell in China are currently originated in the U.S. On the other side, if tariff were applied we will be also impacted from imports of components from China into the U.S. The other thing to consider is that we have 80% gross margins, so the impact on tariffs on this kind of industry will be less onerous than what happens on commodities. We believe we can mitigate the impact of tariffs if they had to happen through some flexibility within our guidance, our manufacturing footprint, our LBS programs. And we will do our best to manage tariffs if they happen without impacting pricing directly, because we will stay oriented to the long-term. We want to continue serve the Chinese consumer in the long-term, continue growing market share in China and we will stay focused on that. I want also to clarify that we are already managing tariffs in Europe which actually is a bigger business which are fully reflected not only in our guidance and in our fourth quarter partially, in our fourth quarter, but definitely in our guidance for next year and we are managing these also doing our best not to do price increases because of tariffs or relative to tariffs. So that\u2019s our situation, but we continue to hope that tariffs will not be applied also because beauty is not a category of tension and represents benefits for all countries. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Christina Brathwaite : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Christina Brathwaite on for Andrea. Thanks for taking our question. So I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the reason the forward saving signs, can you just dive into what the drivers are there or you had some more incremental savings and should we expect that to sort of flowing through into Americas possibility we were surprised that trended negative this quarter. So any kind of color on when that can stabilize, that would be great? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Yes, so let me answer both of those questions. And as it relates to the Americas just recognize that in the Americas segment we also have our corporate expenses. So bonus accruals for the corporation, we have some of it is our global production expenses related to some of our advertising programs flow through our Americas segment. So those are some of the drivers along with some incremental spending for programs to support some of our brands in the Americas. As it relates to Leading Beauty Forward, some of the additional programs that we've added and we've spoken about them before, enabling our creative team to create more digital assets, so really transforming the processes and the technology in our creative areas in order to be able to create more digital assets, restructuring some of our field organization to actually create more support organizations for them so that they can spend more time out in stores coaching and selling with our beauty advisors and with our selling staff. In our supply chain area, we're investing to increase the agility and speed of our supply chain, certainly managing all of the complexity that we see in our global network as well as the frequency with which innovation is happening in our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys, I have a few questions just about your momentum and just to get a sense of whether that's going to continue and really like two dimensions, one is I want to get underneath what's happening between your strong top line guidance for next year and at least about your consensus EPS growth and I guess taxes, your tax rates changing and all that, but what is your like-for-like EBIT margin percentage going to change? There is a concern among investors that yes, you're growing, but you\u2019re buying your growth and factoring investments will have to continue to increase whether it would be on M\u2022A\u2022C or channel shifts and other stuff you shouldn\u2019t be doing. It's just that your margin is going to be under pressure as you invest a lot more. So that is one part of momentum and the second one is if you have seen anything at all to temper the enthusiasm of the Chinese consumers globally obviously a big part of your top line and your margin mix across travel retail and Asia-Pacific. I mean we certainly have heard some companies voicing some very, very recent like past couple of weeks worry about the Chinese consumer getting little bit more concerned around trade wars and everything else impacting their businesses. So thanks for those on momentum. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, let me start just the overall on the first and Tracey will give you also her specifics. We are really committed to the 50 points of margin growth in the next years and what we see we will deliver, we will deliver these. There are impact on taxes, accounting, currencies, and we are managing through these and I hope you realize we are trying to put it on the table in the most transparent possible way, the assumptions that we are taking in managing that complex amounts or restatement. But as far as the ongoing business the combination of Leading Beauty Forward programs together with the merging equities aspects or many of the new channels in markets in which we are expanding should guarantee us to continue increasing half a margin points and invest in growth at the same time. To be clear, the promotional discounting as percentage of the sales is going dramatically down, so our investment is all about brand equity building and we have gone for a few brands that we have advertised with 30 brands in our portfolio advertised, so creating the power of long-term growth in the new kind of channels that we are addressing. So to be clear this wing of channels goes with this wing of support with the consumers and they go hand in hand and are providing us a stronger and you know growth than in the past and as I said, thanks to the other elemental margin the 50% margin. Tracy if want to add? Tracey Travis : No, thank you. I think you answered it well. So if you, Ali think about fiscal \u201918 we actually delivered 70 basis points of organic margin expansion. So we did have positive currency benefit of 40 basis points, the acquisitions did suppress our margin by about 20 basis points, so when you look at all of those factors we delivered about 50 basis points organic operating margin in line with our objectives. So to Fabrizio's point, on average our model suggests that we can comfortably deliver 50 basis points on average of operating margin expansion and continue to invest in all of our growth areas. That certainly is enabled by Leading Beauty Forward and some of the work that we're doing under that program over the next few years. Fabrizio Freda : On China, today we do not see a sign of slowdown of Chinese consumer into sales out there, neither in China mainland nor in the traveling corridors that we are monitoring. So I have - we want to clarify that the assumptions in our guidance for the year assume a certain level of normalization of the growth of China and travel retail in the rest of the fiscal. But in terms of the power of the long term opportunity, I remain completely convince the China market has the potential of a double digit growth year-after-year because the fundamentals drivers are not changing. They are rising or the need the class, the love of luxury and beauty particularly. The ability of the online execution in China to serve the 650 cities where we do not have physical distribution and the ability to have our physical distribution designed in the most productive way of the world with the super high productivity because only focus on high traffic areas and the rest is served by online, so that model is extremely powerful it has long term potential. Now it may go to up and down depending on the overall economy trend in the U.S. or other potential impacting in the short term obviously yes and that's why we are assuming a certain normalization next fiscal year, but these remains one of the biggest long term opportunities in front of our company in my opinion. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Congrats on an amazing year. I would like to just get your assumptions for what's going to happen in the European department store environment in fiscal \u201919 and maybe even longer term it looks like the U.K is facing a bankruptcy today I don't even know if it's a chain that you're operating in but do you see it going the way of the U.S. and are you prepared for that in the way that you've done your projections and maybe just the last thing on how it might be different from what we've seen in the U.S. please? Fabrizio Freda : Yes, first of all what is very different from what we have seen in the U.S. is the penetration of department stores in Europe. So if you mean U.K. I will talk to U.K. in a second, but in Western Europe of the penetration of department store is very, very limited. So, the amount of selling square meters per person are really completely different. So the impact in Europe even if there was the same worrying trend that we have seen the last years in the brick-and-mortar retail in the U.S. It will not have anywhere similar impact. The other thing is that the - frankly the online penetration in Western Europe is individually lower than the one that is in the U.S. And so the ability of moving sales online in Western Europe for the moment has been inferior and because of that the brick-and-mortar is more solid and less exposed to sudden changes in this area. As far as the U.K. is concerned there are some department stores which have been affected by crisis, how is a Fraser is the most significant one and we are monitoring - we are in House of Fraser for perspective in proportion to the U.S. is that the comparison you are making also Fraser is less than 10% of our U.K. business and is more in proportion is what Bon Ton was for the US but this for the moment we don't have signs to this retailer will close actually we have signed that would be restated and that some doors we've closed it will be rationalized for a business that could be even stronger after this rationalization. But in the U.K. the same thing is happening, meaning sales are growing the luxury part, they are growing more in the online area, the online channels and so the mitigating factor we're doing so much earlier and better in online there that obviously this is compensated. The other part which is more specific to Estee Lauder, is that don't forget that in the U.K. we have Boots which is a significant percentage of our business and so our business in the U.K. is less concentrated in department stores. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes, can you hear me? Tracey Travis : Yes. Steve Powers : Okay, great. Hey, so first just to clean up on the guidance Tracey and then a longer term question. The first one is, you just - can you talk a little bit more about why the revenue recognition change has a $0.10 impact this year and is that something you'd get back in 2020 or is that more of a permanent step down a catch up from where you ended 2018? That\u2019s the clean up question. And then thinking more I guess strategically for beauty, I was wondering if you could just expand more on what you see as opportunity in emerging markets outside of China, clearly in fiscal \u201919 you would contend with a significant amount of macroeconomic volatility, but even with that, I think your guidance implies opportunities for growth in that block of markets and as you think about your 10-year compass recognizing the importance of markets like the U.S. and Western Europe and China, I'm just curious as to your expectations for other emerging markets as a driver of growth for Estee Lauder? Thanks. Tracey Travis : Okay, so as it relates to revenue recognition and the $0.10 of EPS impact, it is an accounting and reporting issue only. It is a shift in terms of when we can recognize revenue relative to our promotional programs, so it requires us to defer a portion of our revenue until certain promotional activities have occurred, which is different than how we were accounting for it in the past. So it is a shift forward and we would expect though being under this guidance next year will be comparable but it will also shift some revenue forward but at least fiscal \u201920 and fiscal \u201919 will be comparable. Our commercial activities will not be impacted. There is no change to our shipping patterns or to actually the timing of promotional activities. Just and spend related to those activities will not change as well. It's just a recognition of revenue, so it is a shift. Fabrizio Freda : And as far as emerging markets, we really believe that the emerging markets will continue to be a driver of growth. However, emerging markets are by definition more volatile and that's why we look at it as a portfolio where we have several emerging markets. We are building in each one of them at a different speed and with the flexibility of allocating resources every year to the one that represents the best opportunity not only of growth but also return on investments. So is portfolio markets where we use enormous amount of flexibility depending on the situation with the clear long term goals to have strong market share in each one of them in the medium term. So today we have reached already 50% of business as we said before growing 24% we expect this to continue. In the next year what we have in mind is that we see continuous accelerating opportunity actually exciting I should say in India where we are growing all the way in Russia, in this moment is very strong. We see the opportunity next year to stabilize Middle East that has been a drag to our overall portfolio and we see the opportunity to restart growth in Brazil and obviously we are waiting to see the elections in October, November, but that could be a great opportunity. We expect to continue success in Mexico and other areas where we are doing really, really well and amplify the portfolio of new markets in Asia like the Philippines, Indonesia where we are seeing some amazing growth in this moment and great opportunities for the future. But as I said, there will be every year one or two of these markets that would be an issue and one or two that will be in those areas a tremendous opportunities and you should see us as having the flexibility to direct our investment as needed year-after-year while we stay focused on the long-term. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Good morning, thanks. First, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on the investments that you\u2019re doing in M\u2022A\u2022C in North America and then talk about your profit expectations are for 2019 in the U.S.? But more broadly the U.S. has obviously been a struggle for some time and I know you're not interested in expanding into the largest online provider, but what is the line on the stand on incremental retail expansion beyond like the Ultas and the Sephora and such, I mean would you consider partnering with other retailers potentially specialty apparel other ones to sort of spur activity in your home market? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So Olivia, I\u2019ll start. In terms of M\u2022A\u2022C, and as you're aware, we have expanded M\u2022A\u2022C and Ulta it\u2019s doing quite well. We will look for further expansion there. The brand is doing quite a bit as well in terms of their social media programs to improve the productivity per door of the business here in the U.S. and as it relates to specialty and whether or not we would partner with the specialty retailer, I mean certainly the M\u2022A\u2022C brand has done that in the U.K. with ASUS. If there were one here that had the same type of characteristics that we look for in terms of a third-party presence for our brands on line, then we would consider that as well, but there is a tremendous amount going on with the M\u2022A\u2022C brand in terms of everything from in-store experience to driving their online business more and certainly other considerations. Fabrizio Freda : And again, I want to add just innovation, so M\u2022A\u2022C is working on innovation in the U.S., it is working on improved digitalization in the U.S. and so it\u2019s not only distribution swing, it is not only an improvement distribution, it is an improvement in every single hospital the brand that we are working on and we believe we'll deliver results. In terms of which retailers to do with frankly in this moment in the U.S. we've really focused on growing same door in the best possible way is a matter of as I said we have the new sales force with much more attention to consumer facing activities we can improve our activity in-stores on all fronts and we can support our current retail partners to deliver much more from our brands and continue the online expansion where we are doing fantastic in the U.S. And the current model or brand.com or retail.com is working very well and leads the way of third-party platforms of high quality we definitely consider them and with that strategy the Lauder brand if you heard the presentation of Stephane, it is exactly the strategy the Lauder brand is following the U.S. and Stephane just explained what the great results the brand had, may be Stephane you want to clarify that again? Stephane de la Faverie : Yes, absolutely Fabrizio, I think like in the U.S. like we mentioned in introduction, I think we've seen now a sustainable turnaround of the brand and actually we see our like-for-like growth in-store being actually super than our overall growth. So basically the half and the renovation that we put on the shift of distribution for accelerated like fast growing channel is actually proven that today there is a sustainable growth without necessarily needed today to increase distribution, but like Tracey said, if opportunity comes then we will explore them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey good morning folks. Thank you for squeezing me in. I guess I want to followup on Olivia\u2019s question around the Americas profitability because maybe I missed it, I don\u2019t think you addressed that? The margins have clearly come under a lot of pressure. You mentioned that this year you have some of the corporate expense allocation there which was a headwind particularly in the fourth quarter, can you quantify that to give us underlying read for the business? And then thinking on Forward, we've got growth in online, we've got growth in specialty multi. But it seems like that\u2019s going to be balanced or potentially more than offset by de-leveraging your freestanding stores or department stores, is there a path to margin recovery that will get you back in sort of historical high single digit range or is this sort of permanently rebased or even worse is there a glide path where it can continue to be pressured on the forward? Tracey Travis : I will start, Jason. In terms of the North America team has done a terrific job in terms of recognizing the retail environment and the declining traffic as well as Fabrizio said the door closures that we've experienced in the U.S. with right sizing and resizing business in order to stabilize margin and then start to improve margins. So in the fourth quarter, the bulk of the decline was related to corporate expenses and the North America business was relatively flat in terms of profit. In terms of what we expect going forward, we do expect as I said we do expect North America to deliver or the Americas to deliver low single digit growth. So we do expect North America as well to deliver low single digit growth. And with some of the continuing work that they're doing as it relates to executing some of the Leading Beauty Forward initiatives and some of the other programs that they're working on to really improve door productivity in the remaining doors and certainly the top doors in the U.S., we do expect to start to see margin recovery in the Americas and in North America for sure. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And in terms of the balance of the distribution, the question there is, and I said it in my prepared remarks the scale is changing in our favor, so this being fiscal year 2018 has been the first year where the extra sales we built in fast growing channels were superior to the sales we lost in brick-and-mortar department stores and freestanding stores. So that\u2019s the key thing that happened. So if you exclude the impact of the very big door closures from the year as I explained $164 million over two years, $68 million in fiscal year 2018, if you exclude this balance, these closures the scale is in our favour. I mean we have now the right platform of distribution to grow same doors in the correct way for the future. So a lot will be about the power of our innovation, the power of our investment in media, the power of getting traction from the brand and then keep in mind the door closures also were pretty good in maintaining the consumption on our brands even when the door closed. However, there is a transition period when door closed where this has to happen that can have a short term impact on sales that happened already in fiscal year 2018. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks, good morning. Tracey Travis : Good morning. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Lauren Lieberman : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Clinique and some of the metrics you have given brands like Estee Lauder and M.A.C in terms of those brands performance in some of the stronger doors, so if you would look at Clinique I guess particularly in U.S. and closures exclude the departments that brick and mortar department store channel, are you seeing any sort of positive encouraging signs on Clinique and how it\u2019s resonating with different consumer demograph or cohorts in terms of age group, I know you mentioned what is your target any other franchises how they\u2019ve been doing? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, okay, Tracey indicates I should answer this one. Tracey Travis : I won\u2019t, so I can answer I mean Clinique is doing incredibly well in Ulta it\u2019s doing very well online, so in the U.S. Clinique we are certainly starting to see as you indicated Lauren a pick up outside of the department store channel. The innovation this year and certainly heading into next year is quite strong. So we\u2019re quite excited about what we've seen thus far from Clinique, Moisture Surge they continue to innovate under that franchise, it's doing very well Dramatically Different which is their legacy franchise they introduced a new jelly product which is my daughter is particularly fond of, so that too is doing quite well and their fresh pressed franchise is also doing well. So they've got a lot of great Skin Care heading innovation heading into next year and they've got some exciting new innovation that will let the brand downs and tell you about going forward and so we're very encouraged by the signs that we see from Clinique this year and again as Stephane indicated, we certainly have a track record for having a large brand resume growth in North America and in the U.S. even with the current environment. Fabrizio Freda : Yes and I just want to add I'm really passionate by the work that Clinique is doing in this moment. I think you will see Clinique results in North America in the next year is getting better and better. The innovation as Tracey said is really promising in my opinion particularly the Skin Care innovation. And I also want to remind that Clinique is the most affected of all our brands to disclosures. So the results of Clinique being able to grow retail in the last quarter in the North America in presence of Bon Ton since April basically not taking shipments and not working and in the closures of what happened in Sears in Canada in the previous period and in other doors closures. So Clinique has been offset all of these and stabilize or grow depending by category in a way that as soon as this negative will moderate we will see the power of Clinique acceleration. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi, good morning. Few questions on China. One of two first, of all Tracey give us context as to how large China is, I know it's growing very rapidly it is down nine, 10% of company sales and what did it grow in fiscal 2018? And then I have a followup. Thanks. Tracey Travis : Okay, so you\u2019re spot on. China is about nine - little over 9% of our sales now with the results that we saw in terms of China growth. We don't comment on individual country growth but rest assured that China grew very very very strong double digit in fiscal \u201918 so great performance in China. Steven Strycula : Okay and then a followup for Fabrizio. I just wanted to understand, it sounds like you're getting a lot of incremental consumers across China even with Tmall\u2019s presence. Can you give us a sense as to how Tmall\u2019s your ramp on that platform has impacted different tiers of cities like Tier 1, Tier 2 versus Tier 3 and Tier 4 and how at all has it impacted department store sales within greater China? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, the growth of China has been extraordinary like doors and so our department store in China have as we speak the strongest light door growth, they ever had in the 10 years. Tmall in that sense is not negatively impacting the department store growth. The reason for that is that as you indicated we are in about 118 cities with our physical distribution in China today across all our brands. Obviously 118 is the number of Lauder that other brands match less so when you go to brands like M.A.C. and others we are still in I think around 50 or whatever 60 cities, so there is enormous amount of physical distribution opportunity within the top 100, let\u2019s say 120, 150 cities of China. But the Tmall reached 650 cities and from the data we see the large majority of our sales in this area came from the cities where we do not have physical distribution. And that\u2019s is a very efficient model because the physical distribution in the 118 cities is very efficient because the productivity per door is high and growing and that the new consumers in the city where physical distribution is not yet there or where the level of productivity will not justify physical distribution for the time being can access the brands via Tmall or via brand.com. This model is working and creates this increase of consumer in a very efficient way and also with reasonable capital cost. Operator : Our final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Thank you. Stephane just wanted to touch on this, as you think about the Estee Lauder brand and the improvement that it has made, how do you think about the distribution channels for this business, what should it ultimately be and how do you see the margin opportunities? Thank You. Stephane de la Faverie : Thank you for your question. I think what I was trying to highlight in the presentation that we are is, we've been able to have this amazing growth without increasing distribution. We have some shift of distribution in some areas of the world as we really believe that today our really growth is coming from on one side strengthening our position in the existing distribution, especially focusing on all our flagship doors around the world, but at the same time making sure that we sell the consumer in the fast growing channel like specialty multi online and travel retail. And we really believe that this new distribution that is growing faster than the average is really helping us today to increase the desirability and the equity of the brand overall in the world. So, today the opportunity is in front of us. The Estee Lauder brand is basically like building on all these opportunities and really believe again that makes the model a very sustainable and profitable model actually for the company going forward and the most exciting thing is showed a path for all big brands actually to be able to just like apply the same strategy and to grow like that globally. Fabrizio Freda : And I just wanted to underline that being able to grow 22% without increase of distribution since our profitability is a lot influenced by same-door sales this obviously speaks highly for the ability of the Lauder brands to continue improving profitability. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 PM Eastern Time today through September 3.

Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2019 First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Laraine A. Mancini - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, changes to the provisional amounts related to the recently enacted U.S. tax law, the new accounting standard for revenue recognition and other adjustments disclosed in our press release. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Thank you, Rainey, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal year is off to an excellent start as our multiple engines of growth once again drove double-digit sales and earnings per share gains, reflecting strength across our categories, brands, markets and channels. Strong double-digit advances in many areas of our business enhanced by targeted investments drove comparable sales growth of 11%, our sixth consecutive quarter with a double-digit increase. We leveraged our strong top line growth and benefited from ongoing disciplined cost management, fueled by our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which led to diluted earnings per share climbing more than twice that rate, up 24%. With these strong results and confidence in our ability to execute effectively, we are raising our EPS guidance for the year. We now expect EPS growth of 10% to 12% in constant currency on sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the top of our long-term sales goal. The macro environment was particularly challenging this quarter, with initial impact of tariffs in Europe and China, a softer UK beauty market stemming from concerns about Brexit, and the closure of some department store doors including Bon-Ton in the U.S. and House of Fraser in the UK. Despite these factors and overall volatility, we not only delivered our sales and financial targets, we exceeded them. Our success was widespread throughout our business and driven by the strength of our diverse brand portfolio, innovation and growth engines in every region and channel. Many brands grew double digits including three of our four biggest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u2022A\u2022C and La Mer, reconfirming the power and desirability of strong, established brands. Many markets delivered robust growth. In the Asia region, China, Hong Kong, Japan and every country in Southeast Asia advanced by double digits. In China, our sales accelerated. Consumer demand for our products was also vibrant in our other emerging markets excluding China. Importantly, our retail sales growth in the United States turned positive and global e-commerce and travel retail posted significant increases. A sharper focus on strategic innovation drove our brand growth, particularly in the most popular hero franchises. Deeper analytical insights are giving us a greater understanding of consumer needs by market and amplifying our innovation power. We developed high-quality products for targeted consumer groups and a diversity of skin types that attracted new consumers and achieved strong repurchase rates. We supported our innovations with increased digital advertising and influencer attention that enhanced storytelling, led to higher awareness, traffic and sales. Our strong innovation program is a sustainable growth engine that is broad-based, flowing across all our brands and geographies. In skin care, our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand's hero franchises drove impressive growth. The brand's Advanced Night Repair franchise increased nearly 50% globally, fueled by new supercharged hero product. In Asia/Pacific, sales of the new eye gel soared. La Mer was a star in our portfolio. Its sales climbed double digits in every region on strong demand for luxury skin care and new launches including its Treatment Lotion Hydrating Mask which boosted its global mask business. The brand is number one in luxury skin care in North America and in the UK, it gained share in both markets also reflecting loyalty from devoted consumers. Clinique's skin care business grew globally supported by new innovation and established favorites. To accelerate one of its key product lines, Clinique launched a unique hydrating jelly in its Dramatically Different moisturizer franchise. Initial sales are exceeding our projections. Clinique also modernized its historical ingredient philosophy, making it more relevant for today's consumers. We are also excited about a new Clinique skin care innovation that we'll launch in December and can be personalized for each consumer's needs. Another brand with strong global skin scare sales was Origins, thanks to its moisturizer and hero products. Origins is riding the growing wave of interest in natural beauty products and with its strong positioning is leveraging demand with new innovations. Innovation and creativity in makeup contributed to M\u2022A\u2022C's success in the quarter. Its global growth was led by its international business and reflected its focus on bigger innovation with more impact. Its new Powder Kiss lipstick brought renewed attention to the brand-coveted lipstick collections. It was developed by M\u2022A\u2022C artists backstage and launched during Fashion Week in New York and Milan. Est\u00e9e Lauder brand also achieved excellent growth in makeup. Sales of its Double Wear foundation, its biggest makeup franchise, increased more than 20%, aided by shade extensions and a new product in the line, as it continues to serve and appeal to all skin types worldwide with a broad range of shapes and formats. Too Faced retail sales in North America rose sharply, driven by new shades of Born This Way Foundation and Super Coverage concealer. Too Faced gained share in the U.S., and its Better Than Sex mascara continued to be the best selling prestige mascara in the market. In fragrance, launches from several of our luxury and artisanal brands resonated with consumers, including Tom Ford Beauty's Ombre Leather and a range of scents from By Kilian called MY KIND OF LOVE that was created for specialty multi in North America and Western Europe. Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced Beautiful Belle in advance of the holiday season. Combined sales from brands we have acquired over the past few years rose significantly. We are expanding their target consumer reach by entering new markets, farther penetrating equity-building channels, while at the same time developing new products and integrating them into our operations. Our pioneer digital strategy continues to support our brands in many ways. In terms of e-commerce, all three platforms, brand.com, retail.com, and third-party sites advanced sharply. Our 200 brand sites generated double-digit sales growth and also have become powerful equity-building vehicles. Our brand sites alone attracted nearly 90 million global visits in the quarter, making them also highly valuable media assets. For perspective, we estimate that those consumer visits were worth $250 million in advertising equivalent, demonstrating effective and efficient new ways that our brands have to engage with consumers worldwide. We continue to expand our brands on third-party platforms. We successfully launched Jo Malone on Tmall in China and five more brands on ASOS in the UK, a destination that attracts millennials. Another rapidly growing areas was our global travel retail business, which continued its fast pace, driven by broad-based growth across brands and countries. Eight of our top-ten brands grew double digits at retail in the channel. And many key travel retail markets farther accelerated growth, including the UK, Italy, Germany and Turkey. This success contributed to our strong double-digit retail and net sales growth, far, far outpacing the 6% rise in international passenger traffic. Travel has increased among many consumer groups, including Russians, Middle Easterners, Chinese and Nigerians, helping to increase demand in the channel. Our travel retail channel also benefited from successful launches, effective marketing, and exclusive products. We expanded distribution for our artisanal fragrance brands, which is helping to increase our share in the European region in travel retail. We are making good progress on increasing passenger conversion with new programs. We believe that our travel retail business will continue to benefit in the long term from favorable fundamentals, including growing passenger traffic, increased conversion of passenger to shopper and a broader equity-building distribution of our new brands. Emerging markets, excluding China, were also strong growth drivers, advancing double digits, with the biggest gains in the Middle East, Russia, India, Turkey and Southeast Asia. Finally, we are pleased that our North America results were also encouraging. Our overall retail sales in the U.S. turned positive. If we exclude Bon-Ton, this was the fastest growth rate in more than two years. Our push into fast-growing channels has continued to have a bigger impact, specialty multi and online, especially retail.com grew rapidly. In addition, we improved our business with our department store customers. We expect a solid holiday season as we roll out exciting programs. Est\u00e9e Lauder's blockbuster promotion hits counters and online sites in the U.S. tomorrow. And our brands have created compelling sets in innovation that we believe will drive traffic. The risk of moderation of prestige beauty growth in China, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year, is included in our full year guidance to reflect the possible volatility stemming from the current geopolitical and economical environment. However, I want to be clear that we have not seen any slowdown, and luxury cosmetic historically have been less sensitive to the variability of economic trends because they are an affordable luxury. In fact, our net sales in China this quarter further accelerated, and our strong double-digit growth came from many drivers. Our brands like those sales were robust. We gained share in our department store distribution, and sales in specialty-multi, freestanding stores and online grew even faster. Our e-commerce business reached consumers in the many cities where we have no brick and mortar distribution, leveraging our efficient model. In addition, we achieved double-digit growth across every brand in every product category. Our efforts to diversify our business have been successful as our makeup and fragrance growth surpassed skin care growth. Importantly, our repurchase rates are strong, illustrating the equity of our brands and consumer appreciations for our products. We have a long-term focus in China. We have invested there for two decades. It's an important part of our long-term emerging market strategy, and we plan to continue growing market share and serve our Chinese consumer with the highest quality products. We continue to be encouraged by attractive long-term demographic and economic trends in China as millions of new consumers enter the market. The rising middle class aspires to luxury, and today millennials and Gen Z consumers will have much more disposable income than past generations, particularly as more women enter the workforce. We believe demand for beauty in China and other emerging markets will continue to rise over the long term. In summary, we achieved terrific progress this quarter. Most brands grew, and three of our largest climbed at double digits, including M\u2022A\u2022C which has gained more traction. Retail sales in the U.S. turned positive, generating encouraging business improvement. Many countries had higher sales. In emerging markets, we are strong overall. Our business in the Middle East, which had been depressed, started improving. Sales in China accelerated. Global online and travel retail continue to increase sharply. Our innovations created stronger hero franchises and attracted new consumers. With these strong results to start the year, we are confident about our near- and long-term prospects. Our diverse brand portfolio, strong innovation pipeline and vast global reach supported by local insights and analytics should continue to fuel our success. We have the flexibility to invest where we see the best growth opportunities and are confident in the ability of our leadership team and talented employees to execute our strategy with excellence. We are well positioned to outperform global prestige beauty, deliver strong sales gains and generate double-digit growth in EPS this year and over the long term. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2019 first quarter financial results and then cover our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. My commentary today excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments, including those related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the recent U.S. tax legislation. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency and comparable accounting methods unless otherwise stated. As a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, ASC 606, this fiscal year on a modified retrospective basis. For the first quarter, the impact decreased our sales growth by two percentage points, our operating profit growth by five points and our EPS by $0.06. Net sales for the first quarter were up 11% with virtually all regions and product categories contributing to growth. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia/Pacific region led net sales growth this quarter. Sales rose 29% and most markets saw double digit increases. Sales in China and Hong Kong rose very strong double digits with broad-based growth across brands, categories and channels. Prestige beauty growth in department stores in China continued to grow more than 20% and we gained share, while sales in specialty multi and online more than doubled. Our strong growth extended beyond China and Hong Kong. We also achieved excellent sales growth in Japan, where we experienced growth across all channels, including department stores, specialty multi and online. Taiwan and Malaysia were also up double digits and we had single digit growth in Australia. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 16%, driven by strong double-digit increases in our global travel retail business and emerging markets in the region. All three geographic regions within travel retail grew, led by corridors across Asia. Strong like-door growth drove the majority of the increase and was supplemented by additional points of sale, particularly for our less distributed brands. Our emerging markets growth in the region was led by the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and India. The Middle East had significant net sales growth following the reset that we did last year, but the underlying retail trend continues to be challenging reflective of the area's economic situation. In Western Europe, Italy remained a bright spot, while lower consumer sentiment in the UK pressured brick and mortar retailers. This was seen most acutely in House of Fraser, one of our largest department store customers in the UK, as they reorganize under new ownership. Debenhams is also experiencing some challenges as they announced last week, and we are prudently supporting them as the holiday season begins. Our online business in the UK continued to grow double digits. In other Western European markets, our business was relatively flat, in line with prestige beauty in the area. Net sales in the Americas declined 2%. North America continued to achieve double-digit growth in specialty multi-retail and in online, all of online, which offsets declines in mid-tier department stores and freestanding stores. Excluding prior year sales to Bon-Ton, our sales in North America increased slightly, better reflecting the retail improvement Fabrizio mentioned. Latin American sales declined as the tough environment in Brazil and Mexico overshadowed strong growth in the Andean countries. Skin care continued to lead product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 21%, with strong contributions from the innovations previously mentioned within hero franchises in the Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and La Mer brands. Net sales in makeup grew 6%, led by strong innovations and launches in foundation and lip from Est\u00e9e Lauder and M\u2022A\u2022C. Sales of fragrances rose 2% as gains in luxury and artisanal brands were partially offset by declines in designer fragrances and Est\u00e9e Lauder. Le Labo launched its City Exclusives fragrance set online, continued its strong comp door growth and expanded its targeted consumer reach. Our hair care sales rose 7%, primarily driven by Aveda's strong innovation and its acceleration of online sales. Our gross margin declined 160 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year, due primarily to the impact of new accounting standards, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 220 basis points through the reclassification of samples, testers, and collateral to cost of goods from operating expenses. This decline was partially offset by favorable skin care category mix and pricing of 100 basis points. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 250 basis points, largely due to the 180-basis-point impact of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. For the remainder of expenses, we continue to reallocate expenses smartly to drive the business with flexibility, fueled by savings from our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Lower selling, general, and administrative expenses improved our expense margin by 210 basis points, allowing us to invest more in advertising behind strong innovation to fuel growth. We continue to optimize our marketing mix to maximize returns on investment across all areas. We have found that our increase in digital advertising broadly has been highly effective with a return on investment that is meaningfully higher than traditional media. Operating income rose 13% and operating margin increased by 90 basis points. Excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, operating income rose 18% and operating margin increased 140 basis points. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 20.9%, primarily reflecting the lower U.S. statutory rate and favorable geographic mix of earnings. Diluted EPS of $1.41 increased 17% compared to the prior year and grew 19% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS excluding the impact of the accounting change was $1.47, an increase of 22% compared to the prior year or 24% in constant currency. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth and a favorable tax rate. During the quarter, we utilized $119 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year due primarily to timing differences in shipments and receivables, and we invested $128 million in capital expenditures. We used $530 million to repurchase 3.8 million shares of our stock and paid $141 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.43 per share and an increase in our share repurchase authorization by 40 million shares. Now, let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and the full year. We've obviously had a solid start to the fiscal year, but we recognize that a variety of macro risks, including pre-Brexit sentiments and post-Brexit potential implications, political instability in many areas around the world, and soft economies in certain markets, create an ongoing level of uncertainty in many parts of our business. As you know, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard beginning this fiscal year and the guidance we are providing today reflects the impact of the new method, which reduces our sales and EPS growth due to deferral of recognition of certain revenue and associated profit related to some promotional activity. We have also bridged to the comparable growth expectations we have for the business for ease of comparable business performance. For the year, we remain comfortable with our sales growth expectation of 7% to 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. This does assume some moderation of growth in China and travel retail in the second half, reflecting the current geopolitical and economic risks. It also reflects the previously-announced door closings of certain department store locations in the U.S. and the UK. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 2 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.17 for the euro, $1.31 for the pound and \u00a5687 for the yuan for the fiscal year. And the new accountings standard is expected to negatively affect reported growth by 1 percentage point. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.73 to $4.82 before restructuring and other charges. This includes the impact of known tariffs globally, including the planned increase in China in January, as well as approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the new accounting standard. In constant currency and with comparable accounting, we expect EPS to rise by 10% to 12%. For the second quarter, net sales are expected to increase approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency and using comparable accounting. Currency translation and the accounting change are each expected to negatively impact growth by 2 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported net sales to grow between 4% and 5%. EPS is forecasted between $1.47 and $1.50 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.03 dilution from currency and $0.11 dilution from the new accounting standard. With the strong start to the fiscal year and with our first quarter behind us, we are focused on delivering another successful full year of solid top-line growth, margin expansion and double-digit EPS increases thereby generating strong returns for our shareholders. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Sorry about that. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Good morning. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Fabrizio, you were pretty clear that the fiscal 2019 guidance now assumes more onerous external assumptions in China and travel retail, given the external environment despite the internal momentum. I was hoping you could also take that out to more sort of a longer-term basis as you look out over the next few years. And, A, maybe just on a backwards-looking basis give us some historical context for how much of the top line momentum in these two areas have been driven by macros more recently in the last couple of years versus more enduring factors, just to help us conceptualize the macro risk. And, B, going forward, can you talk a little bit about how you can practically manage or adapt your strategies in those two areas, or even maybe at the corporate level, elsewhere in the organization, if the macro pressure materialized, particularly given the inventory swings in China and travel retail historically which can often exacerbate a retail sales slowdown? So again, that's sort of beyond fiscal 2019 as you look longer term. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah, that is a long question. Let me start from the 2019 part of your question, which was the first part, and then I'll address the long term. So, we have recognized that given the external environment, there is a risk the China TR moderate growth and there is a risk of tariffs. So we have frankly already recognized that risk in the August guidance. However, we have prudently growth the protection of our estimate from that risk this time because obviously, we didn't pass all the beat of quarter one on, which increased our protection of this risk to materialize. If this risk does not materialize, obviously, we have the opportunity to do better. And that's the way we look at it. And we have also internal flexibility to answer more directly your question to move funds and resources to the most appropriate growth opportunity, depending on what we see. And we have, with our leadership team organized ourselves to be ready to allocate resources, depending on the situation externally and depending on the rate of return of our innovation and our initiatives. So that's the way we are organized. In terms of the long term is we frankly believe that the China market will continue to be a market that will grow at double digit over the long-term. And this is going to be driven, as I said in my prepared remarks, by many external factors, meaning demographies, growth of middle class, women work, young generation, purchasing powers and the amazing, amazing interest for luxury beauty in the Chinese consumers. That will not change. It will not be changing because of economic trends. Maybe variable or volatile because of economic trends in the short term or because of tariff implication or any other aspect, but will not change in our opinion for the long term. So, we are assuming that a double-digit growth of China and travel retail will be part of our long-term potential in terms of growth. But also, we have demonstrated in this quarter that to reach a 6% to 8% growth for the long-term, we do not need an over-delivery of China travel retail. We are just implying travel retail and China to continue what we design a normalized long-term growth. And we will be able to deliver our long-term 6% to 8%. And the many other engines of growth are also helping that. Last data point, if you take our EMEA results and you exclude UK short-term issues for Brexit, as Tracey underlined, if you exclude the TR positive impact, you are left with plus 7% growth, which is exactly in the middle of our long-term 6% to 8%, just to make the point. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman, Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Good morning. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about M\u2022A\u2022C. So M\u2022A\u2022C being called out for double digit performance \u2013 I know, Middle East was a big part of it, so some are probably reselling, you know, sort of, the reset that you've done in the Middle East in the route to market. Can you just talk about performance for M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S., both online, separate from mid-tier department stores? What you're seeing in terms of \u2013 you've talked about your hero products, bigger innovation? What is it strategically that's driving some change in that business? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah, no. Thank you. M\u2022A\u2022C is improving sequentially its performance. This definitely in the quarter in the short term has the positive implication to restock in the Middle East and to the improvements of this trend in the Middle East. Therefore, M\u2022A\u2022C is very important. But now also to speak about the negatives, I will say there's also \u2013 there is the negative that Brazil is another important market for M\u2022A\u2022C which it was not very active in this quarter. So, there are positive and negative also internationally. The drivers start becoming many, many. China continue to be a great driver. Asia in total continue to be a great driver. TR continue to be a great driver, and many other emerging markets, and markets in Europe \u2013 Italy, for example, that we have mentioned as for the overall business is one of the best performing markets for M\u2022A\u2022C. And to your question, we continue to see... (34:08 \u2013 34:18) Operator : There will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold. (34:22 \u2013 35:43) Laraine A. Mancini - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Hello. Operator : Ms. Mancini, you may proceed. Laraine A. Mancini - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Okay. Lauren? Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Laraine A. Mancini - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Okay. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. You talked about Brazil, right, emerging markets, Italy... Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah. I was speaking about \u2013 so you dropped when I was speaking that there was the positive of the Middle East that you highlighted, but there was also some negative, like Brazil is not yet back, but obviously because of our external environmental situation. But I was also mentioning the positives for M\u2022A\u2022C. There were China, TR, every single Asia market, Italy. And I was speaking about the improvements in the U.S. in specialty-multi, in online, and I was saying that these improvements are also generated by a more focused innovation plan with fewer initiatives, bigger, and focus on the key drivers. And I made the example of lipstick, but we have also a big example in foundation and an exciting innovation plan in front of us. So, M\u2022A\u2022C is on improvement trend in the U.S. and continues its solid performance overall internationally. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Binetti, Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. Great quarter. Let me add my congrats. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Thank you. Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Thank you. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Tracey, would you mind adding any, kind of \u2013 is there any kind of numbers you could add around how much you guys adjusted guidance related to the tariffs and the more conservative assumption around China and travel global? Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Basically, when we gave guidance in August we included the known announced guidance at that time that we knew were going to be impacting us. And so that was tariff related to the EU and some preliminary tariffs in China. Subsequently, it has become more certain at least that \u2013 or at least we believe that we may experience higher tariffs in January. So, some of the \u2013 embedded in the guidance in the second half from an EPS standpoint is the inclusion of that increase in tariffs. We do, as we said on the last call, 30% of our product in China comes from the U.S. The balance comes from our factories around the rest of the globe. So, that's generally what the exposure is. We also export products out of China, primarily raw materials and components. And so, we do get a duty drawback on that. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Just following up then. I think some of your competitors have mentioned seeing the category, the beauty category accelerate globally. And then, there has been some comments on strengthening trends behind premiumization. As I look through your guidance, I know you guys always try to make sure you're on the conservative side of where you see the category headed, but it seems like those two dynamics, in particular, with the global growth accelerating and then premiumization would \u2013 could potentially be an outsized benefit for you given your exposure. Can you speak to anything you're seeing related to \u2013 I guess, you kept your outlook for the category the same, but I didn't really hear any commentary on premiumization, how you see those two trends. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: So, I'll take this one. And premiumization, absolutely we see that. As you see in our \u2013 but, again, your question is about guidance. So, the guidance \u2013 I'll comment to the guidance in a second. But in terms of the results we see today, we see the market of beauty remaining very strong. Our estimate is 5% to 6% for the year, which assume in this 5% to 6% a little slowdown in the second semester, but the current growth is very strong. And we do see premiumization, meaning prestige is growing much faster than mass in all the markets that we have data about. And most importantly, we see consumer continue to trading up and going toward luxury skin care, basically towards quality products and quality experiences. And we see the overall luxury experience, which includes service and customization, to be more and more preferred by consumer, and we believe this is a long-term trend and the fact that we are a company completely focused on prestige we believe is a strong competitive advantage for the long-term because in all our brand, we are delivering the premiumization benefits that the consumer is looking for. Your second part of the question was more specifically in the guidance. No, on the contrary in the guidance, as you have seen, we do not assume the market to accelerate \u2013 the premiumization to accelerate in the second semester. Actually, we assume a moderation of this phenomenon for the next short term for the January-June period, not necessary for the long term but that's in the assumption and again we explain why we are taking prudently this assumption at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Good morning. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. I had a question on your Makeup business. Operating income declined as did margins, so you called out stepped-up spending behind Too Faced. So, I was hoping you could drill down a little further on this to give us a sense of, I guess, where you're at with the spending and then maybe how much your Makeup business would be performing excluding the spending. And then, hoping to get a sense of how much longer the spending levels might be or stay elevated behind Too Faced. And then finally, more importantly, what kind of lift you're seeing right now if any or really what your expectations are? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah. So, regarding Makeup, we did have \u2013 we called out as well some declines in our Smashbox business. But the Too Faced investment \u2013 the Too Faced had quite a few large launches this quarter. They launched their Born This Way Foundation with extended shades, Born This Way Concealer. Their Tutti Frutti line as well launched this quarter. So, they had \u2013 quarter-to-quarter, it's very difficult to look at our results from a spending standpoint because we are so launch and innovation driven. And if it's a bigger launch one quarter than the next, you'll see perhaps outsized spending and depending on when that spending happens in the quarter. So I would expect that our Makeup operating margins will improve throughout the balance of the year, and you'll see more normalization there. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Ottenstein, Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much and terrific quarter. You're obviously doing a really nice job on some of the larger well-established brands and I know this is a tricky question, it's very hard to dissect, but I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the contribution of innovation to those brands and e-commerce and if it's possible, obviously they're connected, but I was wondering if it's possible to kind of tease out the impact of both of those factors? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah, so first of all, on all these brands, and frankly on every brand that the impact of e-commerce is very positive. As we explained, we have brand sites, retail.com and overall platforms like Tmall. We are growing in each one of these three segments very strongly, double-digits, and particularly on platform at very strong double-digits, and also in retail.com at very strong double-digits. And we expect this strong trend to continue because also we are creating great experiences online in all these platforms and the consumer is more and more interested. We are very strong, and we have been investing for years in this area, so we consider our e-commerce business a strength and something we can continue to leverage and be at the forefront of the industry with it. In terms of the contribution of innovation, as I touched in my prepared remarks, we are really taking innovation to the next level. Our innovation today is much more focused on the right opportunities, on the right consumer targets, on the right benefits, thanks to a major work we have done in the last couple of years on adding analytics and more sophisticated analytics to our way to determine how to innovate and to focus our marketing plan after we have produced the innovation, and we see the results of this. Personally, I believe that a big part of our acceleration on the big brands is driven by the quality of our innovation and by the ability to focus innovation on the areas of biggest return. Finally, we are really focused on product quality. That's why at the end, we speak about prestige. Premiumization is about qualitization in my opinion and the consumer are going more and more towards high quality products. Our products are superb quality as we see from the repurchase rates of our consumers. So innovation needs to be pushed with trial, but after the trial what really makes the innovation successful is how many consumers come back more and more to buy the product, that we measure with our repurchase rates. And we have extraordinary strong repurchase rates and obviously profitability is driven by repurchase. Investments are driven by trial. So we always keep in mind this difference. Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: And the only thing I'll add to this and this doesn't directly address your question, but just a reminder that for our overall company, our increase from pricing and distribution has been roughly the same in the 2% to 3% for distribution, 2% pricing. Everything else is innovation and comp store sales. So the big acceleration that we've seen, which certainly includes the performance in China and travel retail but also online, has been really in that category, which is very, very strong and very healthy for us. Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC : So it sounds like you've got a very nice, for lack of a better word, formula working that has had this gaining traction, and it seems to be gaining some traction in Clinique. Would that be fair? And do you see \u2013 and how would you look at the mix between the innovation in e-commerce in terms of getting Clinique even to a higher sales trajectory? Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Thank you for this question. Actually, yes, we do expect Clinique to get a lot of acceleration, definite from online. That's already happening and will continue to happen more, but as I mentioned particularly from innovation. I believe Clinique is one of the best innovation programs in this moment in front of us, and I said there will be a new launch of Clinique, which is very important in December which is very exciting in the area of Skin Care. And there is more innovation to come. Plus the ingredient story of Clinique has been taken to the next level, and this also is having an initial encouraging impact on consumers. So we are in a situation where three of our biggest brands are already growing double-digits, in which M\u2022A\u2022C is gradually improving, in some points, which has been U.S. and UK. And in a situation where Clinique, we believe has the potential for the total fiscal year to go back to growth as well. And so our ambition is to finish this fiscal year with all our top-four brands on a growth trajectory. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson, Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Could you talk about the trends in the specialty-multi business in the U.S.? I think for the last few quarters, we've heard you talk about strong double-digit growth, and it has clearly slowed a little bit in this quarter. Is that just a function of Smashbox weakness? And can you update us on kind of where you are? I know you don't want to tell us exactly how many ULTA doors M\u2022A\u2022C is in, but kind of where you are maybe inning-wise? Are you in the third inning of distribution expansion for M\u2022A\u2022C into ULTA doors? Or just how much more run-way is there for new door expansion in specialty-multi? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah, you're welcome. And so we are doing well in specialty-multi. We continue to grow. And this has continued to be one of our key drivers. And we are at the point already, we communicated that last quarter, where the benefit of specialty-multi start to being substantial, so having a significant impact on our growth in the quarter. That's very positive. Now there's been some slowdown on Smashbox for sure, as you mentioned, and that's obviously a slowdown of the results of growth. But the other brands really in specialty-multi did very, very well, and there is no other sign of slowdown. Actually, I would say, most of them are on a clear accelerating trend. And there is more potential for distribution. Yes, on M\u2022A\u2022C in Ulta, there is more potential for more doors. That is not only about M\u2022A\u2022C. There is more potential for many of our small and medium-sized brands that have the opportunity to further accelerate distribution in this area. And as you know, we had also some distribution in online and flagship doors of brands like Jo Malone and La Mer, which are also performing very well on the high-end consumers that shop in this channel. So overall, we are positive and we believe this story can continue to build over time. Operator : Our next question is from Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to stick on the topic of innovation. Fabrizio, maybe you can just talk about some of these new product launches you referenced in terms of the personalized skin care product and just some context around if you've tested it, what kind of demographics does it appeal to? And then maybe you can also talk about the Clinique 72-hour moisturizer and kind of how you think about that product relative to how it's maybe tested or your hopes and desires for that franchise? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah, so on the innovation on Clinique, which is customized to every consumer, I prefer not to comment more. We are in the process of announcing it to the various retailers around the world, and so we'll be soon official and will be launched in December. But basically is the kind of innovation our analytics are giving us, meaning innovation that is not only a great product quality that provide interesting and relevant benefits. But is also proposing to the consumer a new customization idea and so there is responding to new desires, doing it in a way which is unexpected and different. And that's the quality of innovation I'm speaking about. We always had to make quality products. We always had the ability to create interesting benefits. But we are now learning how to do it in a way which is much more customized, more differentiated and anticipate new consumer desires in a world where the consumers is more at the center of the attention and leading the process. In terms of the other innovation, yeah, the Moisture Surge, which is the Clinique 72-hours benefit product you had mentioned is doing very, very well. It's one of the key driver of the success in skin care of Clinique, and it's the results of a extraordinary technical innovation, where the level of moisturization is extremely strong and very appreciated by the consumer, included into a formula with a very special texture that we know has high level of appreciation by the consumer around the world. So, it's strong, it's doing well, and we believe there is potential to do even better in the future. We'll continue to drive it. Another example is the launch of jelly, which I mentioned, which is basically taking the core franchise of moisturization of Clinique and giving it a different form and this jelly form, by the way, our analytics show that there was absolutely preferred by a certain group of consumers, particularly young consumers. And so, with the goal of rejuvenating, of making younger, that historical franchise of Clinique, we have chosen a form, a texture, and a model of benefit that we knew was preferred by this group of consumers. And, in fact, the results are coming. So, it's about applying our historical innovation strengths to better analytical understanding of the opportunities and thanks to this, creating much higher rate of returns of our innovation scheme. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Bolton Weiser, D.A. Davidson. Linda Bolton Weiser - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. So, when we talk to investors about your strong trends in growth and innovation and everything, you've been talking about, one of the pushbacks we get is that we are getting potentially close to the end of the cycle. And some investors actually think we will get a recession in the next 18 to 24 months. So, can you talk about \u2013 in the past, you had invested quite heavily through the cycle and especially in a downturn you continued to invest behind your brands. Can you talk about \u2013 is there anything different in the structure of your business or the mix of your business, this cycle that would potentially mute the decline in your earnings that we saw in past downturns? Thanks. Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah, so, I'll start. One of the big differences quite honestly is Leading Beauty Forward. And so, the efforts that we have taken to take more fixed cost out of the business to structure ourselves differently, to invest behind faster growing areas, we actually have more flexibility in our cost base, which you hear us talk about quite often. And in terms of investing behind when markets are strong and when innovation is strong, but also pulling back when there is a downturn or to your point if a recession were to occur. So, I think structurally the company is much, much stronger today than it was a few years ago, because of all of the work that we've done in programs like Leading Beauty Forward to really reorganize our expense base and invest behind areas that really drive the growth of the business. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: So, to that point of Tracey, basically, we have higher variable costs and lower fixed costs, and we are more flexible, and we have great cash. And so, the ability to go through recessions with cash assuming this had to happen. But I want also to touch on the part from the consumer. To be clear, we have a portfolio of brands, that really go from the entry price point of prestige to the luxury. And so, we have seen during recession our abilities also to push more the brands which are at the entry price point and to leverage them. And today, we are much more capable of doing that and we have a much richer portfolio across the several price points. The other thing which has changed is \u2013 please, let's not forget that prestige cosmetics are affordable luxury. And the famous thing that Leonard Lauder said many years ago about the lipstick index, which is when there is a recession, women buy more lipsticks, not less, for the simple thing that it is affordable luxury in a moment where maybe other luxuries is not the right priority for families or for people. And so, we believe that we can leverage much better than in the past the concept of the lipstick index. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan, Stifel. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. One housekeeping question, one follow-up on the Clinique line. One, just Tracey, is there any benefit anticipated in the second quarter guidance from sell-in ahead of the tariffs? And then just on Clinique broadly, I guess maybe to put the question in a different way, why has the brand not resonated with consumers in recent years? And, I guess, the question is, the innovation sounds pretty exciting, but from a brand standpoint, how much of it is the brand itself where there's a lot more competition for a dermatologically correct skin care makeup brand today versus maybe 10 years or 15 years ago? And then how do you think about spend or innovation around kind of modernizing it versus just running the business kind of as it is with lesser growth than you have seen in recent years versus history? Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: So let me start on the tariff question. We are seeing obviously incredibly strong growth in China, so we have not been building up related to the tariffs. We've really been flowing inventory as we have it to support the slow or the very fast sales trends. So we don't have a big inventory buildup in China where that would cause the moderation or the slowdown that we're speaking about in the second half. As it relates to Clinique, and I'll let Fabrizio add on to this as well, one of the things that we mentioned in the last call that I would just remind you of is, Clinique has been one of the brands that's been disproportionately affected by some of the retailer dislocation that's happened, particularly in North America \u2013 in Canada and in the U.S. because they were so strong in those businesses, so. And the same in the UK as well, we're seeing that impact with Clinique. So they have been disproportionately affected by that. The innovation in recent years has been quite strong, and certainly there's been a lot more competition in the space. I always say great brands attract great competition and certainly our brand portfolio has done that. So the innovation, as Fabrizio mentioned that Clinique is coming out with, is informed by insights, the competitive environment, what consumers are looking for today, and being done in a Clinique way. And so we are very encouraged by early signs that we've seen on some of the product launched starting with Moisture Surge and certainly the jelly that Fabrizio spoke about and the upcoming innovation that will begin to be phased out in December on the new product line which is quite exciting. Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: And I just want to add that the Clinique team, which is probably listening to the call, will be very happy about your question because they could not agree more that they are working very hard on the modernization of the brand. They have modernized the allergy-tested, fragrance free position of the brand with the new purity statement. They're modernizing their stores. They're modernizing their packaging. We spoke already about innovation. There's been a lot of progress on Clinique and frankly, you would see already more of this progress into the number if it was not for the fact that, for example, Bon-Ton closure is the large majority impacting Clinique, the House of Fraser softness in the UK is for the large majority impacting Clinique. So Clinique has been the most impacted not necessarily by the consumer not liking the brand, but really from the dislocation of the distribution reality around the world. And the work they are doing on modernization of the brand starts working well, and we believe will give soon better and better results. Operator : Our next question is from Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. And let me add my congratulations. Maybe just a segue from a lot of the comments on Clinique, but when you take a step back and just think about the natural beauty trend, how much of your portfolio today really lends itself to this macro trend? And then going forward, how are you weighing the opportunity to invest behind this trend in your existing portfolio today versus looking at M&A? Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.: Yeah, in our portfolio, first of all, the purity concept is actually the Clinique concept. As I said, today it is called in many different ways. It's called clean, natural, et cetera but \u2013 so the brand that is now stepping up to leverage this trend in a unique Clinique way is actually Clinique. The other brands are obviously Origins, which is, as I said in my prepared remarks, exactly in the middle of that and in fact is having exciting results. And exciting results because it's leveraging the strength and because it's doing great innovation exactly on that trend, like the very recent launch of Origins lipstick line in the U.S., which is a super exciting flower-based line that leverage even in lipstick the natural trends that personally, I believe, will be very, very interesting for the consumer worldwide. And then we have Aveda. Aveda is in the middle of this since always, since ever. Not only Aveda adds to the natural element to be leveraged, the sustainability element as well that is a very strong preferred Millennials point of view today. So Clinique, Origins, Aveda are the obvious question that we are using these brands to further leverage these trends. And on your question on M&A, we always look at the M&A possibilities around the world, and if there will be opportunity in these areas, obviously we will consider them.

For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Rainey Mancini : Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, changes in contingent consideration, the finalization of provisional charges related to the U.S. tax law enacted at the end of calendar 2017, and the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey. Good morning everyone. We delivered excellent results in our second quarter, as multiple engines of growth drove cost of currency double-digit gains in sales and earning per share, led by strong advances in our product categories, brands, countries, and channels. We strategically invested in the most promising opportunities and our rich digital content engaged consumers, attracting then to our high quality innovative products. Overall, net sales grew 11%, and therefore the first time exceeded $4 billion in a quarter. We achieved this milestone despite an extremely challenging and volatile environment, which included softness in two of our largest markets, the U.S. and the U.K. and global trade tensions. This is a testament to our strategic resource allocation, superb execution by our talented employees, and improved capabilities throughout the organization. We leveraged our strengths where we had the greatest growth opportunities, including China in travel retail. And we further broadened and diversified our growth engines with strong results in the rest of Asia and emerging markets, in our fast growing channels, and in most brands. The benefits from our leading Beauty Forward initiative allowed us to deliver savings and selectively increase our advertising spending, which in turn supported our strong top line growth and enabled us to leverage our cost structure. Diluted earnings per share rose 25%, more than twice our sales pace. Importantly, we accelerated our share growth in Global Prestige Beauty in the quarter, which confirmed that our strategy has enabled us to gain share profitability. With an outstanding first-half and ongoing confidence that we will continue to effectively execute our winning strategy, we are raising our sales and EPS guidance for the year. We now expect sales growth of 8% to 9%, and EPS gains of 14% to 16% for fiscal 2019. In the recent quarter, we benefited from many growth engines throughout our business, supported by strong product innovation and effective marketing which was informed by improved customer insights and data analytics. Our innovation program is getting stronger. We have developed more advanced data and are using it to focus on top priority areas and create highly desirable products. The proof is evident in sales from new launches. We have reached an all-time high of nearly 30% of our business. And we become even more sophisticated marrying analytical insight with our innate creativity. We believe our innovation has the potential to reach new heights, also thanks to the improved speed to market. Over time consumer demand for different kinds of beauty products fluctuates, and skincare is currently the fastest growing category globally. With agility we deployed more of our resources into this area. Our skincare sales grew sharply, while our makeup and hair care categories also posted healthy gains. Our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands were stars in the fragrance area, but the category declined slightly because of some designer fragrances. Estee Lauder Beautiful Belle was a popular new scent during holiday gifting season. Three of our largest brands grew globally, validating consumer loyalty to powerful authentic, well-established brands, especially when supported by compelling innovation and strong hero products. Momentum continued in our Estee Lauder brand, which climbed double-digit for the seventh consecutive quarter. The brand delivered double-digit increases in every region, and a stellar performance in both skincare and makeup, led by it's hero franchises. MAC gains were led by a strong international showing, and it continued to pivot to fast-growing channels with great penetration online and in specialty multi. La Mer continued its superior results and gained share in every region in luxury skincare, fueled by growing consumer loyalty to its beloved products, and effective digital campaigns they recruited many new consumers. Clinique continue to make good progress. Although it's overall results were impacted by the clients in North America brick and mortar department store, including the closure of Bon Ton. Nonetheless, Clinique skincare sales rose globally on the strengths of several key franchises, and we are optimistic about its skincare growth in the coming quarters, reflecting expected strong performance from recently-launched innovations. Clinique new hydrating jelly and it's dramatically different moisturizer franchise achieved terrific results across the globe. The brand newness innovation, Clinique ID is a breakthrough product lineup that is custom fit for consumer needs by offering 15 combinations of different moisturizer and treatments. It launched in the last week of the quarter, and is off to a very encouraging start, exceeding our expectation in many markets. Clinique ID has the potential to become one of our company's most exciting launches, and addresses consumer growing desire for more personalization. Looking at other brands in our diverse portfolio, our comfort luxury brand resonated very well with consumers, and fragrance brands, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, Frederic Malle, and By Kilian achieved double-digit growth to face further expanded internationally, it remained highly ranked in the U.S. specialty multi-channel. A key strategy via our brand success is creating a significant base of profitable repeat business from devoted consumers by attracting new users with compelling innovations in marketing, and then, the quality of our products turn them into lifelong fans. Many of our brands strive in a broad range of markets with diverse consumer needs, showing the power of that global appeal layer it with locally relevant insights. We have developed robust analytics, and are using the data to help inform our innovation and our communications. Together, with compelling storytelling, macro influencers and digital advertising, we can now better engage the consumers through our product offerings and marketing. Asia-Pacific continued strong growth at a double-digit rate. China led the advance, Hong Kong and Japan had solid gains, and our sales in Korea accelerated. Virtually every brand generated higher sales in the region both at net and retail boosted by the hero product and successful locally relevant innovations. Luxury brands have been in high demand in China, and our sales mirror that trend as they increased strongly. We continue to be share as prestige beauty further accelerated in the market, and every brand category A major channel grew double-digits. Makeup has been gaining favor among Chinese consumers. It now represents nearly one-third of our mix of business there. Within prestige makeup, Estee Lauder, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Tom Ford were especially popular, it gained significant market share. Online has been growing sharply for many quarters. It now accounts for more than one-third of our sales in China. We had superb results on Timo, and with the growing interest in makeup, M\u00b7A\u00b7C was the number one prestige makeup brands on Timo during the entire calendar 2018 and has became number two in prestige makeup in the total market. Demand for prestige beauty from Chinese consumer has remained strong, in spite of macro issues and potential risks to the economy, including higher tariffs as our next month's a more oversight on Chinese travelers who buy goods offshore for re-sales domestically. So far, we have not seen any impact and remain optimistic about the long-term health and resilience of prestige beauty in China. The industry will be driven by favorable demographics and we are confident that the largest growing middle-class in China will remain passionate about high quality beauty products. We note also that other actions such as the announced tax cuts have the potential to sustain consumer consumption over the next few years. Beyond China, our success in Asia was widespread as we further diversified our growth engines in the region. Our strategy in Japan is to broaden our target consumer reach beyond our primary department store channel. We made excellent progress, further penetrating specialty multi and online and had rapid growth in those fast-growing channels. With strong fragrance growth in Korea, we gain share led by our high-end brands By Kilian, Tom Ford, and Germano. Our business advanced in the Europe Middle East and Africa region with Good underlining momentum in most markets. We had gained the most emerging markets with large improvements in the Middle East and delivered increased in the group of developed Western markets. Even though prestige beauty in North America was challenging during the last month of the holiday season, the influence also by the government shutdown in a week store market that impacted consumer sentiment. There were several a bright spots in our business. Several brands expanded further in ULTA, where we have seen strong growth, including Estee Lauder, M\u00b7A\u00b7C Clinique and Bumble and Bumble. Many of our brand's holiday sets were popular, including Estee Lauder blockbuster, which sold through early on. We saw strong retail sales on department store and specialty multi e-commerce sites as well on our own brand sites. Our global digital agenda is working well and is a key enabler of our company strategy. We continue to support our brands we compare the social media programs, technology advances, and growing online initiatives. Across our e-commerce business, our orders, a conversion increased and the $125 million global visit to our brand size during the quarter made them highly valuable media assets. Sales on our brand sites, retailer sites and third-party sites, all grew double-digits. Several brands had record breaking days online during the holiday period in North America for example, Estee Lauder, La Mer generated sales record on their sites on black Fridays and Cliniques Cyber Monday event was his largest ever. In China single day activations boosted many of our brands on Timo. Sales on our brand stores on Timo, on that day November rose, nearly 80%, and Estee Lauder and M A C were among the top five performance in total prestige beauty. In Europe, with speed and strong demand for our products on third-party sites, including Asus in the U.K. and Zalando in several markets in Europe. Our global travel retail business remained robust. 13 of our brands grew double-digits at retail all categories grew, and light door sales were strong. Our retail sales rose several times more than the pace of global passenger traffic growth, and we lifted our business with successful exclusive products La Mer, for example, leverage the opportunity to reach travelers who arrived in the U.K. or new flight from China. As a result, the travel retail business in the U.K. skyrocket. Traveling consumers are showing an increased interest in the convenience of ordering products online before departing on their trips. Our online travel retail business known as retail sales increased dramatically. It's starting to account for the meaningful share of our business where it is available and is increasing conversion of travelers into buyers. In addition, we are working with travel retail partners to develop alternative online selling models into the channel. To build on these exciting opportunities, our brains are now developing digital campaigns specifically for travel retail. International passenger traffic is expected to continue to increase in the next two quarters and we have plans to expand our brand presence in airports. For example, we plan to open more doors for our newness artisanal fragrance brands in our new millennium focus was makeup brands like Too Faced in makeup. In closing, we are very pleased with our progress this quarter, and in the first six months of our fiscal year. Many of our key brands in counties delivered terrific growth, China remained a very strong. Middle East improvement and our momentum expanded in other that emerging markets. Our two fastest growing channels online and travel retail kept up their rapid pace globally. Our innovations were highly successful and our hero franchises continued to support growth across the portfolio. We are proud of our financial results and share gains in global prestige beauty, and are increasing our guidance even while recognizing certain geopolitical and economy risks in the short term. At the same time, I want to emphasize that historically prestige beauty is being less sensitive to economic downturns because it is affordable luxury driven by repeated repurchases and loyalty. Long term, our industry has strong fundamentals including favorable democratic demographics they should drive solid growth for years to come. In the next two quarters, we plan to invest more behind our innovation to further build our share to continue fueling our innovation success. We expect to invest behind important new product launches such as Clinique, upcoming innovations in popular products. And that leveraging our brands during Chinese New Year, we robust advert in dollars in beautiful dedicated products. We're also locating additional resources to strengthen our capabilities throughout our business. Our strategy is to further build our global share and drive long term profitable growth. We are very well positioned to succeed. Over the last few years, we have streamlined our organization to better capitalize on global opportunities. We have unleashed savings from Leading Beauty Forward and other programs that we plan to invest in the most exciting opportunities to strengthen our leadership and to continue driving profitably. We operate our business with a long term view and their upbeat in our outlook. Thanks to our diverse brand portfolio, wide global reach and talented employees who are successfully executing our winning strategy. We believe the fiscal year 2019 would be another year of exciting sales gain in double digit EPS growth. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning everyone. First I will review our fiscal 2019 second quarter financial results and then cover our expectations for the third quarter and for the full year. As a reminder my commentary today includes the adjustments that were mentioned at the beginning of the call by Rainey. All net sales growth numbers I will discuss are in constant currency and compatible accounting methods unless otherwise stated. Also as a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition ASC 606, this fiscal year on a modified retrospective basis. For the quarter, the impact decreased our sales growth by two percentage points, our operating profit growth by seven points and our diluted EPS by $0.11. And now for the quarter results, net sales for the second quarter rose 11% with broad based growth across most regions and product categories. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region had robust net sales growth this quarter. Net sales overall rose 20% with many markets experiencing double digit increases.  Sales in China and Hong Kong grew very strong double digit with most brands categories and channels contributing to growth. Our sales in department stores in China continue to grow strong double digits and other channels especially online rose even faster. We also achieved excellent mid-single digit sales growth in Japan and Korea, with growth across all channels including department stores specialty multi and online. And other markets such as Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia also contributed to the region's growth with our sales in Australia declining slightly. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions rose 16% driven by strong double digit increases in both our global travel retail sector and other emerging markets in the region. Double digit like door growth across most brands drove the majority of the increase in travel retail and expanded consumer reach for brands such as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford and M.A.C also contributed to growth. Outside of travel retail, the Middle East, Turkey, and Russia are emerging markets growth in the EMEA region. Western European growth was mixed with Greece and Italy particularly strong and Germany more challenged. Our UK business declined 2% as macro issues dampen consumer spending including the uncertainty over Brexit with the greatest impact felt across brick and mortar distribution. The online business remained a brighter spot as consumers continue to shift their spending time online. In online we had solid growth across most retailer and third party site. House of Fraser, one of our largest department store customers in the U.K. has been reorganizing under new ownership, and we therefore reestablish trading with them in November. Net sales in the Americas decline 3%, excluding $22 million in prior years sales to Bon Ton, the region sales would have declined 1%. North America continues to achieve solid growth online with strength across both retailer and brand site. While much of brick and mortar sales in North America softened in December. Net sales in the specialty multi- channel continue to grow particularly ULTA. Latin American sales were flat overall as growth in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina was offset by a decline in Venezuela. Skin care again led product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 22% with very strong global contributions from the Estee Lauder and La Mer brands. Both brand had successful new products as well as growth in existing franchises. Our Origins brand also delivered a terrific performance in Asia and travel retail reflecting increasing demand for the brands key product line. Net sales in makeup grew 6% led by strong demand for Double Wear foundation in Asia and travel retail as well as the greater focus on makeup in our US holiday offering. M.A.C and Tom Ford continue to resonate with Chinese consumers and BECCA saw double digit gains from its holiday program and other new products. Net sales of fragrances declined 1% as declines in designer and Estee Lauder fragrances offset gains in luxury and artisanal brand. Our hair care net sales rose 6% primarily driven by Aveda's recent launches and strong online sales. Our gross margin declined 250 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, due entirely to the impact of the new accounting standards which negatively impacted our gross margin by 240 basis points through the reclassification of samples, testers and collateral to cost of goods from operating expenses. Additionally, favorable mix impacts of 85 basis points were mostly offset by adverse foreign currency and obsolescence. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 280 basis points. Major drivers of the improvements include 180 basis points related to the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, 130 basis points from lower selling cost and 90 basis points of savings in general and administrative cost. We reinvested a 120 basis points more in any AMP to drive the business and still realized expense rate improvement. Operating income rose 8% and operating margin increased by 20 basis points. Excluding the impact of a new accounting standard operating income rose 15% and operating margin increased 120 basis points. Diluted EPS of a $1.74 increased 14% compared to the prior year and grew 18% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.05 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS excluding the impact of the accounting change was a $1.86, an increase of 22% compared to the prior year or 25% in constant currency. For the six months, we generated $1.27 billion in net cash flows from operating activities which was slightly below the prior year due primarily to invest in inventory to support our international growth and some timing differences and payables and receivables. We invested $292 million in capital expenditures and we returned significant cash to shareholders. We used $1.13 billion to repurchase 8.2 million shares of our stock, and we paid 297 million in dividend, essentially doubling the value of stockholder distributions this year, compared to the first six months of last year. During December, we took impairment charges of $38 million for goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Smashbox brand. This action reflects the slowdown in the brand's makeup sales driven by increased competitive activity and slower-than-expected growth in key retail channels for the brand. The charges represent less than 20% of the carrying value of Smashbox's goodwill and other intangible assets. Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year. We had an outstanding first-half, which would reinforce confidence in our full-year guidance. However, there are still a number of macro risks and opportunities encompassed in our outlook for the second-half. These include uncertainties caused by political instability and soft economies in certain markets, including the U.K. and Europe with the Brexit deadline impending shortly, saw January retail trends in some areas of the U.S. also influenced by the government shutdown, strong but somewhat moderating growth in China in travel retail, the impact of expected additional tariffs in China and comps in the U.S. easing as the impact of Bon Ton sales in the prior year decline in our second-half. As Fabrizio mentioned, given the strong first-half performance, we are raising our expectation for full-year net sales growth to 8% to 9% in constant currency, excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. Currency translation is expected to negative effect reported sales growth by three percentage points, reflecting rates of 1.147 for the Euro, 1.283 for the Pound, and 6.874 for the Yuan for the full fiscal year. We now expect the impact of the new accounting standard to be immaterial to net sales growth for the full-year. We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.92 to $5, before restructuring and other charges. This reflects a slightly lower effective tax rate estimate of 22%, approximately $0.22 of dilution from currency translation, and $0.01 dilution from the new accounting standard. In constant currency, and with comparable accounting, we expect EPS to rise by 14% to 16%. For the third quarter, net sales are expected to increase approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency, and using comparable accounting. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by five percentage points and the accounting change is forecasted to add two points to growth. Therefore, we expect reported net sales to grow between 5% and 6%. EPS is forecasted between $1.26 and $1.28, before restructuring charges. This includes approximately $0.09 of dilution from currency and $0.18 benefit from the new accounting standard. With a strong are-half of fiscal year behind us, we are focused on investing further behind key launches, digital outreach, and brand expansion to support future growth in North America, and continued strength in other markets. We have the flexibility to make these investments in our second-half, while delivering another successful full-year of solid top line growth, margin expansion, and double-digit EPS growth, as reflected in our increased guidance for the year. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start on China, because the growth there obviously continues to be fairly impressive. First, if you could talk about the overall environment, because some of your luxury peers are also saying that they haven't seen a slowdown yet, but in terms of your outperformance, how much do you think has the environment has held up better than it appeared versus the actions you are taking, growing market share, positioning yourself in faster-growing channels, wanting more brands, more online initiatives, all these things. And can you give us a sense of where your comp growth is versus what's come from new brand launches into either the market or also online. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Okay, so the environment of prestige beauty, I want to be clear, is strong. Actually, as we said in our prepared remarks, the prestige beauty market in the quarter has further accelerated growth. And our performance within that market is very, very strong because we continue to build market share even in an accelerating market. So, to answer directly your question, our program is working very well, and we are very satisfied, so there is a lot of our specific activity which is working, that's why we are growing market share. But the market also remains solid. This is the prestige beauty market; it's not necessarily the total economy, which is different, which shows that prestige beauty is particularly resilient in China versus the total market. And this comes from the passion of consumers for the category, for the growth of the middle class, and very importantly from the role of young people in the overall Chinese consumer base. China is a very special market where the young generation is consuming more than their parents in many areas, but particularly in prestige beauty, where the market share of prestige and luxury in the young generation is bigger than the market share in prestige and luxury in the more adult consumer, that's why prestige beauty in this moment is doing well and is also in general more resilient than other categories in China. Operator : Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys. So, wanted to better understand and maybe help quantify what is actually in the expectation or in your guidance particularly along three dimensions, one is North America. Can you talk a little bit about that by channel? It looked like specialty multi slowed a little bit. Want to get a sense of growth there by channel. Two, as again, just on China, Tracey, I think you mentioned quote unquote moderating -- solid but somewhat moderating in China. Just want to understand what you've put into your guidance there. And then anymore you can give us about the return on those investments you're making in the second-half, try to help us understand the expectations you're setting on guidance. Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay. So, I'll start in terms of the Americas in the second-half. In general, we are expecting slightly improved performance in the second-half from the America region and in particular in the U.S. for a couple of reasons. One, obviously, as we mentioned, we are not anniversarying the Bon-Ton shipments from the first-half of last year. So that will represent some improvement. At the same time, we're cognizant of the fact that January, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Ali, has been quite soft. And everything from weather related issues to obviously the government shutdown I think has impacted consumer sentiment in the U.S. in the third quarter. We also have very strong innovations that, as I mentioned, we are supporting globally, Clinique iD being one of them and really focused on our largest brands, some of which will be announced later. And that will, also, we expect those to do quite well, and we are investing incremental advertising in the second-half in North America behind those programs. So, from a channel standpoint we expect some improvement in department stores, some continued good performance in specialty multi in particular with the traction we've seen in Ulta and Shoppers Drug Market in Canada and a few others. And online, online continues to grow nicely across all of the channels of distribution, retailer.com as well as our own brand.com site. In terms of the return on the investments that we're seeing in the second-half, we obviously have a tremendous amount of experience, and Fabrizio suggested in his prepared remarks the improvements that we've made internally in terms of our data analytics, so we have lots of information to inform not only the new products that we're launching in the second half of the year, but how to communicate and what to invest behind in terms of marketing those products, and what generates the highest return. So that is a continual area of increasing improvement for us. And obviously, as we have seen in the first half we've showed that we actually had good return on the investments that we've made in that area. Operator : Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning\u2026 Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Wendy Nicholson : -- can you talk about the margin on the skin care? I mean, it's phenomenal, and I guess, if you can unpack that a little bit, is it more driven by channel, is there less promotion in that, is that a function of Leading Beauty Forward, is it the growth in China and you just have to spend less to support the brands there, just trying to get a sense for a 30% plus operating margin in skin care, how sustainable is that going to be going forward? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So I'll start and Fabrizio may add to it, Wendy, but thanks for the question. So skin care grew at 22% in the quarter, and that's a combination of great innovation, the investment that we put behind skin care in all markets, but in particular where we saw the greatest momentum, which was in Asia, as well as in travel retail, and we saw the benefit from those results. So that really is the predominant driver of the better margin in skin care. Skin care is also benefiting from the investments in Leading Beauty Forward. Both in terms of lower cost as well as some of the investments we've made in digital and social capability internally that's allowed us to market these skin care products in a better way. So I mean those are all contributing factors to skin care. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, and I'd just like to add that the profitability is also improving in skin care because of the strong growth is leveraging our cost base in an amazing way, and the strong growth is generated by our much more accurate ability via the use of data to identify target groups and ways to reach the target group be it a channel or an investment in advertising and digitalization. So then the new model we are developing, which is more data based is making the growth stronger and the stronger growth is leveraging our construction better. The other thing is -- the second point is a Leading Beauty Forward is really transforming our P&L structure and taking money from fixed costs to advertising. And within advertising and promotion to be clear, the entire increase is advertising. Promotions are flat despite our strong business growth. With that dynamic, advertising is much more flexible. Advertising is the resource that you can move from a working initiative, from taking down initiative, which is now working in very fast front in market which has a good momentum or out of a market that doesn't have a good momentum. So we have basically made our resources much easier to allocate with speed to the biggest opportunity around the globe. And this improved agility is increasing return of our resources and this is very evident in this moment particularly on skin care. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Hi, can you hear me okay? Tracey Travis : Yes. Steve Powers : Okay, great, thanks. So I actually wanted to follow up on Fabrizio's comments there surrounding Leading Beauty Forward, both for an update on the benefits you're achieving as well as for more perspective on the cost of achieving them. I think if my math is correct and my records are correct, since the start of the year, you've raised your anticipated restructuring cost now by about 50% at the midpoint. So again, just hoping you could elaborate on what initiatives are driving that increase, what portion of those costs are cash, and whether we should view this as your point forward program costs and benefits or whether this is in effect an increase in the overall program both in terms of the cost to achieve, but also hopefully the benefits also, thanks? Tracey Travis : Yes. So I'll start and then Fabrizio might add to this. We did raise the expected benefits as well as costs of the program at the beginning of the year. So we're now expecting the full program costs to be $900 million to $950 million and the benefits to be $350 million to $450 million, once the program is complete, the full annualized benefits from the program. So yes, you are seeing higher charges this year related to that increase. The increase is driven by adding more programs to Leading Beauty Forward. We launched it in 2016, this is the last year of charges for Leading Beauty Forward and then we realized the benefits from the ongoing programs execution. So, so that's the reason why you're seeing higher cost from the program. In terms of the elements of the program, we have a number of supply chain initiatives in the program to increase agility and reduce inventory levels and speed to market. we have supported an accelerated transformation in our digital and social capability through the Leading Beauty Forward initiative and have incurred restructuring charges related to that. We've established shared service operations in the organization and that has allowed us to leverage a growth, which you saw certainly this quarter in our sales much more effectively and flow more dollars to the bottom-line. We have investments and savings from our procurement programs and that has allowed us to achieve more savings in our indirect procurement spending, which we expect to continue going forward. So there are many different areas under Leading Beauty Forward that we've invested behind in the program over the last two and a half, almost three years now that we've been managing the program in order to drive the kinds of results that we're seeing now and expect to see in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Great thanks. Good morning. I guess my question for retail is for you on the comments you made on pre-tail travel retail sales. It sounds like that's become more of a sizable portion of the overall business. Can you just share a little bit more about that? And how do you think about the expansion plan for pre-tail and then I guess any comments on what you're seeing from a customer base with Clinique iD if it's reactivating a lot of consumer bringing in a new customer? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, so pre-tail is as I explained in my prepared remarks is basically the possibility when you have a ticket, you're making a journey, you could instead of buy in the airport you could buy online before coming to the airport and then you will get the products at the airport in some cases on the share your airplane and that's today is mainly in Korea and I would say is only significant in Korea. So it's the beginning of the learning about this area but in Korea where this has started is becoming a significant part of the business. We believe it is a pretty good idea. First of all, it's a good service to the consumers that can decide to shop while traveling even without investing the time to go to the store, so it's a good convenience process for the consumer but interestingly as an impact in improving conversion because we know that you know, we estimate between 10% or 15% of the travelers by anything. Obviously, if you had the possibility more conveniently to buy yearly online and taking your time to choose this can increase the amount of conversion. So this can be overtime in other booster of the overall market potential in travel retail in our opinion because it can be conversion boosters over time, but to be very clear for the moment is a Korean mainly a Korean reality. Second question is a Clinique iD, we see very promising initial results from Clinique iD. The consumers are very interested, they are trying the product and by the way the advertising spending behind the brand is just starting and we will see more in the next months and the large majority actually will be in quarter four, so there is a lot of great programs that in the next six, eight months will then hopefully bring Clinique iD to the levels that we believe has the potential to go, as I explained in my initial comments is that the idea of personalization and is very much appreciated by the consumer and the personalization opportunity together with the high tax services the Clinique provides in every touch point with the consumer together with the data, the information that we have, what are the concerns that people have and our ability to focus the personalization on the most promising concerns that Clinique can address the combination of these factors we believe they are strong potential. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes, thanks. So just a quick housekeeping and then the real question just on the cash flow I see for the first-half of the year cash flow has been lagging operating profit quotes. So just wanted to get some context around that, and then the broader question is, when you really think about how much your channel mix has been diversifying. I'm just curious if you're finding opportunities on the sampling line. My understanding is that that's a decent size nugget in the P&L and so I'm just curious if you're finding opportunities to save money in that area? Thanks. Tracey Travis : All right, Nick. So on the cash flow, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that our cash flow was a bit less than last year, really primarily related to working capital, given the strong growth that that we've had two years running now, we certainly are staging quite a bit of inventory to support growth going forward. So, that combined with we had some very aggressive programs last year as it relates to payables. We're still seeing improvement and payables and receivables but less improvement than we saw last year which was as you recall a record year for us in terms of cash flow growth, so that's really what's happening in the cash flow so still quite strong as it relates to cash generation strong enough that that obviously we purchased a fair amount for own stock in the first half with the excess cash that we had. Nik Modi : Sampling? Tracey Travis : Yes so sampling in terms of the channel mix and the samples with the growth of online that does require some sampling in certain markets, so certainly in venues in Asia and in the Tmall in particular it -- we do have a lot of samples in that venue, less, so in travel retail and in and a bit more mix in specialty multi but certainly as we see the shift out of department stores, I would say samples in general the cost has comedown but certain channels do require more samples than others but overall sample cost is coming down. Fabrizio Freda : And the only thing I want to add is that we have done some great work in the cost per sample, but the idea is to invest more in more samples in the future because trial is when you have a high quality products with the kind of rapacious rate we have been able to create a early trial with the proper the sampling is a great opportunity and so we will continue to invest in the number of samples particularly on our new upcoming very promising innovations that we are reducing the cost per sample. Tracey Travis : And are being more targeted in terms of the products that we're offering sample then. Operator : .: Rosie Edwards : Yes, good morning. And just a quick follow-up on China and you emphasize prestige a number of times when describing the market conditions and do you think that they're the share gains of prestige versus other channels in China have increased, largely the mass market here. And then, just very quickly, no mention of France at all, am I right in thinking that for those no disruption from the yellow vest rights that we saw in Q4? Thanks. Tracey Travis : So I'll take the second question. In terms of France, we did see growth in France, obviously, a bit slower given some of the protests, as you mentioned, but we did see growth in France. So I talked about Western Europe had mixed performance but France was one of the markets that actually did grow. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, now France was good. Your first question on China, yes, well, what we mean is that again, the phenomenon of the young people in China and the middle class in general to trade that to high quality products is continuing and is actually accelerating, so our view of the market is that high quality is paying out and they trade that to quality is continuing even in a situation where there are more economical concerns than in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys, so the comments on North America\u2026 Tracey Travis : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, how are you? Tracey Travis : Good. Dara Mohsenian : So the comments on North America were helpful in terms of the week holiday season and obviously the January issues but for retail, I was hoping for more of a longer term perspective sort of setting aside January and moving past that, do you think North America can get back to consistent growth going forward as you look out the next fiscal year and beyond, particularly with the growth in specialty and online and maybe just preempt tonight's speech a bit and give your own state of the union on North America and thoughts there and then also on the margin side obviously we've seen some large compression last few years, so can that reverse at some point going forward or do you expect to see continued investment there ? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : I'll start with the trend in North America. Absolutely, we believe we are on the process of turning around our North American business and we believe that we will go back to growth in North America and to put again more perspective on the last quarter and the quarter was pretty solid in November included and the December has been a very soft month and then as Tracey explained also the beginning of January continue that trend, we attribute at least part of that to the government shutdown to the overall consumer sentiment was not a easy moment to spend a lot of money in December. But our performance in November was very, very positive. So we -- when we look at the quarter results in the U.S., particularly the market was flat. Now, the market before was growing 5%, 7%. So all the difference that we see in our performance in the U.S. in the quarter is frankly, is the market is not what we are doing in the market for the long-term. So our agenda for the long-term is unchanged and what is it is first of all, we are investing more money, we will have more advertising power on the right priorities in the U.S. and we will see some of it taking place in the next six months, particularly in quarter four behind some great innovation that with the helpful data has been tailored to the American consumers even more than the past in many aspects. Our analytical efforts have also helping our U.S. team to have a much more granular analysis or what are the opportunities by group. For example, we are focusing our existing hero products more on the Hispanic target group where we didn't have sufficient market share as an example. And our field restructuring that will be fully in place by the end of this fiscal year will allow us to execute this part of the tailoring by American region and groups in a much more accurate way that we ever been able to do in the past. And then, to your point, the expansion in the fast-growing channels is accelerating and we are going to be in a situation where the majority of our business will be in fast growing channels in the percentage we further increase and obviously this will help the people and I want to underline we are still working very collaborative with our department store partners to restart growth in department store, which we believe is absolutely a possibilities also thanks to the very encouraging results that in e-commerce are happening in our department store faster with our department store partner. And so, it's a combination of factors that we believe will bring U.S. again to growth in the future and then when this will start in fact the we also depend from the overall market in the U.S. and how the overall market situation will evolve and how the overall consumer sentiment in the U.S. will evolve but for the long-term, we are absolutely focused on that. Margin? Tracey Travis : Yes, they are and then on margin. Just a reminder that our America sector does include a portion of our corporate expenses, so in terms of what happened in the quarter, we the Smashbox impairment that we mentioned was charged against the Americas segment. The revenue recognition impact from a profit standpoint was $21 million as it just states in our press release. And then we had some of the investments that we made in IT and few other areas that also impacted the Americas segment. We certainly expect that when the Americas segment returns to growth that we will start to see the impact from a margin standpoint. And the Americas region itself is strong from a margin standpoint but because we have some of these other items in here, it does suppress as it always has some of the margin result and certainly as the sales growth has softened in the Americas we're seeing that impact in the quarterly results currently. Operator : Your next question comes from Caroline Levy was Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much and good morning. I'm going to pivot back to China and just ask you for your perspective on the changes that might happen amongst Daigou, the resellers who buy in travel retail who I think are now required to have a tax ID to resell in China. So just to talk about whether you think there is an impact has been an impact, will be an impact and then you mentioned tariffs and we also know that there's some lower import taxes I believe in the beauty segment. So putting all these different things together, how do you think each of them play out? Fabrizio Freda : Let me just comment on the Daigou phenomena. First of all, our travel retail business has not seen the impact from the stricter enforcement generally. So we don't see the impact so far. Is also important however to remember that we add Estee Lauder companies have a long standing policy, the limit, the numbers are products that is single consumer can buy at any country in our travel retail globally since ever. So we were never benefiting from lot of the guys do business because of our strict policies to avoid that any phenomenal ID's and obviously to limit any of these markets around the world. So this policy that is being restricting us in the past is turning probably to be an advantage today because we see less of the difference, that we believe would see less on the difference whatever will be the implication of these new legislation. Typically as far the moment we do not see any impacts. And the other important things is that we believe in general, the items of prestige beauty at the end affordable luxurious. So people can still buy even the new regulation something which is lower price and still makes purchase again within our policy. And so this will we continue being good more actionable on low cost items than on very expensive items. And so I believe there will be also these differentiating factors overtime. And then we continue to focus our efforts also on the drivers of our travel retail business for the long term independently from the Daigou issues. So continue to target get to the international passengers and to the rising middle class working when our corridor, we continue at really increase the distribution of our new brands, we continue the conversional travelers into shopper as I explained before also helped by the potential in the long term of the prepaid system. We continue to deliver more services in exclusivity through the channels also in terminal exclusive products. So all these great actions they we had do in the travel retail for the long term I believe as their potential to more than offset whatever would be the limitation of created by that by phenomenon.  So that's the aspect of -- sorry, was it\u2026 Tracey Travis : And then Caroline, as it relates to China as we mentioned any expected tear offs that have been discussed we've included within our guidance. So that's certainly in our second half expectations both as it relates to the margin and in expenses. And as it relates to the import duties, yes, certainly over the last few years now, there has been a steady increase in import duties and as we stated previously we have passed their savings on to consumers. We do believe that has stimulated some of the growth in China for sure, for all of the prestige beauty players who have who have done the same. And in addition to that with some of the tax cuts that Fabrizio mentioned in our prepared remarks and that are expected to benefit Chinese consumers this year income tax cuts. That also is another stimulus that we think will support continued growth in prestige beauty. Fabrizio Freda : And the last thing I want to add is on travel retail particularly is that, the impact of our increased advertising investment in the key countries where the big populations that travel or origin is frankly the biggest driver for travel retail. The travel retail business is driven by our ability to create demand and aspiration for our brands and our great products in the country of origin of the travels. The travel retail business without these investments, without these great brands and great product obviously we will not flourish just because of whatever system and whatever promotion or whatever price or duty discounts. So the key idea is that what we are seeing in our travel retail business is also the results at the end of what we discussed before, meaning the Leading Beauty Forward system liberating more resources our ability to invest these resources in advertising, in the key markets and improved innovation programs that goes with it. All of this is the main driver for travel retail and we should not forget that. Tracey Travis : And that's the main driver in China, we seen the same in Russia, Brazil and other markets that have large traveling consumers purchasing. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. I just want to ask something about the Middle East. And so that a business it's you call that is very strong I know it's been super choppy to say the least given distributor route-to-markets. So if you could just kind of give us an update on any changes you've made in the route-to-market, anything you've been able to do or maybe not to kind of smooth out in a shipment versus demand and manage that business differently then maybe than the case in two years ago. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, I do say what we have seen today is just the beginning of the plan we have to reinforce in the Middle East in many aspects because what we have seen today is more of really adjustment of the stock. If you remember when there was the biz slow down all of it sudden there were two high stocks in the market and when because of the sudden slowdown the stocks went very high, in the long chain that you just described that what happens is that people don't buy the new products first because they have stocks of the old products. In these low down even the ability to create more consumer interest, so we had been breaking these negative cycle and we have gone back to add more reasonable level of stocks which means more orders of the new and more ability to involve the consumers which is at the end what really counts on the power of our innovation and power of our brands. And doing that we have seen that an improvement off trends. So that's the current situation. In the future, we will make further improvements that we had brands that have very high potential they can be far the leverage we have regions with Middle East which has high potential they can be far the leverage of that and we have obviously get beat it to and there is more enough sizing on the new innovation. That to be clear this is not yet in the results we have published so far but has the potential to be in the next couple years in the Middle East. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks so much. Fabrizio Freda : You're welcome. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Rainey Mancini : Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, the net gain on liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, changes in contingent consideration, the finalization of provisional charges related to the U.S. tax line active at the end of calendar 2017 and the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, which benefited our results this quarter. All net sales and EPS gross numbers are in constant currency and exclude the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to for Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey and good morning everyone. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results, thanks to strategic investment in our best opportunities combined with creativity and data-driven insight that fueled our innovations. Our double-digit constant currency growth in both sales and earning per share came from being well diversified across categories, brands, geographies and channels, our multiple engines of growth, all while staying 100% focused on prestige beauty, one of the fastest growing consumer areas worldwide. Our net sales growth accelerated to 12%. We continued to gain global share. We invested some of the savings generated from our Leading Beauty Forward initiative into targeted advertising, which helped support our increased sales and leverage our cost structure. Our diluted earnings per share rose 17%. As you recall, when we reported last quarter, we were cautious in our outlook as it related to several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors around the globe. These includes a prudent stance on the United States, given the industry slowdown in December. We also anticipated that the uncertainty surrounding Brexit would continue to dampen consumer spend in the UK. Lastly, we factored in a gradual moderation of growth in China and travel retail due to trade tensions and economy slowdown risks. While some of these risks materialized, particularly, the softness in the U.S. and the U.K. markets, slower growth in China and travel retail did not happen, which contributed to our over achievement in the third quarter. The key areas that had been driving our strong performance this year continue to be vibrant. They included; the Asia Pacific region, the skin care category, The Estee Lauder, La Mer, and Tom Ford Beauty brands and several other brands and the travel retail and online channels. In addition, most emerging markets grew, in particularly, we continue to attract and retain consumers in India and Russia with locally relevant products and compelling social media. In total, our strategy is working and produced again exciting results. Skin care continue to be our largest and best performing category, which reflected global trends. With increasing demand for skin care around the world, we devoted more resources to this area. And our sales rose sharply. Our makeup business climbed solidly with strong results across many brands in our portfolio. And our fragrance sales were healthy, driven by our high-end artisanal and luxury brands. Having confirmed the strength of our business this quarter, we are raising our full year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect sales growth of 10% to 11%, well above our long-range goal and the industry and EPS growth of 18% to 19% for fiscal year 2019. During the quarter, three of our four largest brands grew globally, demonstrating the popularity of established loyalty-driven brands, offsetting high quality products, backed by decades of science and creativity. Our largest brands continue to enjoy strong repurchase rates for their hero products by also attracting new younger consumers with compelling innovations and digital storytelling. One of our stronger brands was our namesake Estee Lauder, which has now delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. This quarter increase was the strongest one yet. Estee Lauder sales rose in every region. And its skin care, makeup, and fragrance business each grew double-digits globally. Estee Lauder had terrific initial success with a new product, Micro Essence with Sakura Ferment, which launched in Japan, before rolling out globally. The idea for this innovation came from local insights in data analytics and was created as a watery lotion that provides a strong skin foundation for a translucent glow. The formula and benefits are locally relevant to that target Asian consumers. In the lotions first month on counter, sales of the Micro Essence franchise more than doubled and lifted entire brand. Importantly, the lotion attracted younger consumers. We estimate over 30% of the new consumers buying the product in the first six weeks were millennials. It is now rolling out in the rest of Asia and in key traveling corridors. Clinique overall own sales declined slightly. However, its skin care category increased globally, driven largely by Clinique ID, an important innovation that has successfully attracted new consumers, younger and multi-ethnic consumers and it has performed particularly well in the specialty multi-channel, making it a big win. Clinique ID strengths the brand dramatically different moisturizer franchise, enabling users to customize a moisturizer with one of five treatments, creating a truly personalized experience. In addition, the brand's social media activity around the world won webby award. In makeup, Clinique introduced a new foundation, Even Better Refresh, which incorporates repairing and hydrating skin care benefits and in the U.S., it helps increase sales in its entire Even Better franchise, which is one of its core hero lines. For MAC brand, our MAC brands grew globally on the strength of its international business, driven in part by terrific consumer response in travel retail, where it launched its first campaign specifically for the channel across all regions. MAC China sales soared and it was the number one prestige makeup brand on Tmall. Several new pure play platforms in Europe, including ASOS or Lookfantastic contributed to its strong e-commerce sales. MAC also continued to make progress in specialty-multi and opened in Sephora in Canada, where it quickly became the number one lipstick brand. Our four brands with annual sales over $1 billion is La Mer, which grew rapidly and gained share in many markets, including France, Italy or across total Asia. Recent innovations and engaging social media programs recruited new and younger consumers. As an example, La Mer relaunched one of its core products called The Concentrate. During the first four weeks in China, sales of The Concentrates grew by 60% and more than half of the consumers were new to the brand, driven in by successful digital marketing. La Mer also enjoyed one of the highest repurchase rates and that trend continued with large base of loyal consumers who are devoted to the brand and to its products. Our two fastest growing channels continue to rapidly expand. Travel retail delivered outstanding results. And its growth drivers were well diversified. We had a double-digit net sales gain from each one of our top five brands. The two largest geography regions within the channels and the skin care and makeup categories, we strengthened our leading position in prestige beauty, in travel retail. We developed many activities with focus products that capitalize on higher traffic during the Chinese New Year. Our Estee Lauder brand, for example, opened pop-up locations in key airports, even outside of Asia to reach traveling Chinese consumers. Our retail sales growth during the quarter was far ahead of passenger traffic growth, a trend we expect to continue, as we bring more brands into more airports, increased conversion, leverage our increased brand investment in local markets. Our sales were also boosted through our accelerating online pretailing business which more than doubled. Another fast growing channel, our global e-commerce business continued to thrive. And for the first time, half of our sales came from mobile devices, with the highest penetration in Asia Pacific. Tmall continued to be a large contributor to our online sales in China. We recently successfully launched Tom Ford on Tmall, now our 10th brand on that platform, and our strongest launch on Tmall so far. We see terrific runway ahead of our online business expand. With many more brands to rollout in dozens of countries, MAC for example, became our first brand online in Vietnam, launching on LAZADA with a store-in-store online model followed recently by Clinique. Looking at our geographies. Asia Pacific, continue to be the major contributor to growth. Nearly, all countries grew led by China, Hong Kong, and Japan as well as Southeast Asia, particularly in emerging markets. This performance strengthened our number one position in prestige beauty in the region. Skin care, makeup, and fragrance, all grew more than 20%. Our net sales in China rose sharply, with across the board gains in categories and channels and virtually all brands grew by double digits. Retail sales also increased strongly. In total, our emerging markets grew double-digits. India, while still small had excellent growth. We strengthened our number one position in prestige beauty also there. Recent launches of our Aveda brands a make-up collections from Tom Ford contributed to the country's growth. Clinique and Estee Lauder have signed Indian Brand Ambassador, as they make a bigger push in the market. Clinique new spokesperson, a Bollywood actress, will promote the brand globally. We continue advancing our strategy in North America, which includes increasing our presence in fastest growing channels. And our retail sales rose in specialty multi and online. The Estee Lauder brands retail sales improved, helped also by a successful Gift with Purchase program at Macy's. The brand sales rose sharply during the event, even with fewer doors than in the past years, reflecting strong desirability and social media engagement. M.A.C retail trend is improving. It continue expanding in specialty multi as mentioned. Our innovation continue to resonate strongly with a greater focus on strengthening, our most important brand franchises. This fiscal year, sales from our new innovations tied to our hero product, comprised nearly 40% of our total innovation, up over last year. Our innovation toolbox includes data analysis, rich insights about global and local consumers, and the long history of scientific discovery and connectivity that we combine to capitalize on big, fast growing and new opportunities. Our strategy to create fewer bigger launches is working beautifully. The average size of our top 30 product launches is 30% higher than last year. In addition, our speed-to-market is faster. In the third quarter, we had 17% more products in skin care, makeup, launched under 12 months than in the previous quarter - year quarter. Products launched with the last year are expected to account for 30% of our sales in fiscal year 2019, a new record. Among our latest innovations launching now is Clinique Moisture Surge eye concentrate, which expands one of the brand's large hero franchises. In makeup, M.A.C is extending the shade range of its new Powder Kiss lip collection that was created by using analytics to understand consumer needs, combined with creativity for the brand's makeup artist and runway trends. The results is a unique formula, a moisturizing lipstick with a matte texture, that we are supporting with advertising. And in the new development, consumer can now buy these lipsticks and order M.A.C products directly from the brands Instagram's post. M.A.C is our first brand to use this technology, which simplifies shopping through social media. During our Investor Day, we spoke about the importance of our social impact in charitable activities. And today I want to highlight, the incredible work of our M.A.C brand. This is the 25th Anniversary of its VIVA GLAM campaign, which has raised nearly half a billion dollars to help people affected by HIV and AIDS in more than 100 countries. Every penny of every VIVA GLAM lipstick sold goes to the cause, which is a vital part of the brand DNA and actively supported by its makeup artist and consumers alike. In the last nine months, we achieved outstanding results while continue to transform our business to adapt to a changing global landscape and competitive beauty environment, and to be always well positioned to leverage the biggest future opportunities. Without losing our advantages of scale and scope, we are instilling a more entrepreneurial mindset to ensure we stay agile and act decisively. This gives us the best qualities of a well-financed structured organization with the challenger spirit of a start-up. This is unique positioning and is just one of the many characteristics that makes our company distinctive. We are proud of our performance this quarter and fiscal year, and confident we are well positioned in the biggest and best opportunities, to keep advancing our strategy winning model. We have an amazing portfolio of diverse and desirable brands. We are the prestige beauty leader in two of the fastest growing channels, travel retail and online and our wide geographic footprints enable us to invest where we see the greatest rewards. Our innovation has never been more robust and our hero franchisee in still high loyalty and attract new global consumers. All of this is made possible by our talented employees, led by our exceptional leadership team, who many of you met during the Investor Day. Our results this quarter proved, once again, their ability to execute so effectively. The diversity among our leaders and the breadth of their ability make them the best in the industry and they are essential to our success. As we wrap up fiscal year 2019, we are mindful of ongoing geopolitical risk, yet confident in our ability to continue executing with excellence across brands, countries, and channels that we have demonstrated throughout the year. In closing, long-term prestige beauty has strong fundamentals, backed by positive demographic trends. Even if an economy slows, we believe that our industry will be less affected than most consumer goods businesses, as we have shown in the past. Prestige beauty is an affordable luxury and our aspirational brands have high consumer loyalty, an enviable pricing power, putting us in a unique position as the best diversified pure-play to deliver long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. Now, Tracey, will discuss our financials. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our expectations for the balance of the year. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of this call. All net sales growth numbers that I will discuss are in constant currency and using comparable accounting methods, unless otherwise stated. Also as a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, ASC 606 this fiscal year on a modified retrospective basis. For the quarter, the impact increased our sales growth by 3 percentage points, our operating profit growth by 21 points and our diluted EPS by $0.27. I would encourage all of you to look at the bridges that we've included in the press release this morning, as we do have a lot of adjustments. But I will talk to the adjusted numbers as I go through the quarter results. Net sales for the third quarter rose 12% with growth in our international regions and all product categories. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region had robust net sales growth this quarter. Net sales rose 27% with all major categories rising double-digit. More than half of the markets in the region saw double-digit growth, led by a sharp increase in China, reflecting the continued strength of prestige beauty. Nearly every one of our brands rose strong double digits in China, as did all distribution channels. Among the larger markets in the region, Hong Kong rose double digits, Japan grew high single digits, and both Korea and Australia delivered solid mid-single digit increases. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 20%, led by strong double-digit increase in our global travel retail business, which Fabrizio just described. The EMEA region also benefited from growth in emerging markets, led by India and Russia. Growth in Western European markets was mixed. Modest increases in markets like Italy, Greece and Switzerland were essentially offset by modest declines in France, Benelux, and the U.K. Net sales in the Americas declined 6%, reflecting a deceleration in prestige beauty in brick-and-mortar retail in North America. We continued to achieve solid growth online across both retailer.com and brand.com site. Latin America sales declined overall, as growth in Brazil and Mexico was offset by declines in other markets like Chile and Venezuela. Skin care, again, led product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 21% with very strong contributions from the Estee Lauder and La Mer brand internationally. Estee Lauder sales were driven by continued success in hero franchises, notably Advanced Night Repair, Nutritious, and Revitalizing Supreme, as well as preliminary sales from the launch of its Micro Essence with Sakura Ferment in Japan. La Mer saw success from its Arrive Hydrated travel campaign and its New Year holiday program in Asia. Our Origins brand also delivered terrific results in Asia and travel retail, reflecting the strong performance of its Dr. Weil Mega-Mushroom franchise. Net sales in makeup grew 7%, led by strong demand in Asia and travel retail. Key drivers of the growth included Estee Lauder's Double Wear and Pure Color franchises, La Mer's Luminous Cushion foundation, Tom Ford's Beauty Lip and eye makeup and M.A.C's locally relevant activation, Strike of Kings and Tmall Super Brand Day in China. Fragrance net sales rose 5%. Higher net sales of Estee Lauder, Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and Le Labo fragrances were partially offset by declines in certain designer brand fragrances. Our hair care net sales rose 1%. Higher net sales from Aveda's recent launches in Asia and targeted expansion in EMEA were partially offset by soft sales from Bumble and bumble. Our gross margins declined 160 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. The new accounting standard negatively impacted our gross margin by 135 basis points. Favorable mix impacts and pricing were offset by higher obsolescence, negative currency and tariffs. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 410 basis points or 70 basis points, excluding the impact of the new accounting standards and currency translation. Increases in digital advertising to support innovation were more than offset by savings in selling and other expense areas. Operating income rose 28% and operating margin increased by 260 basis points. Excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, operating income rose 6% and operating margin contracted 30 basis points, entirely driven by negative currency. Diluted EPS of $1.55 increased 33% compared to the prior year and grew 40% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.09 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS, excluding the impact of the accounting change was $1.28, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year or 17% in constant currency. During the quarter, we liquidated investments held in a foreign subsidiary and realized a net gain of $71 million before-tax, which was reported in other income in our GAAP financial statements. This equates to approximately $0.15 of EPS. Also in the third quarter, we recorded additional impairment charges of $52 million for goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Smashbox brand. This reflects the continued softness in the brand's makeup sales driven by slower than expected growth in key retail channels for the brand. For the nine months, we generated $1.76 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, below the prior year, due primarily to higher inventory levels to support international growth and the timing of payables and receivables. We invested $441 million in capital expenditures and we generated $1.22 billion from the liquidation of investments discussed a moment ago. We continue to return substantial cash to shareholders as we repurchased $1.34 billion or 9.7 million shares of our stock and we paid $453 million in dividends. We are obviously pleased with our third quarter result. Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. Global prestige beauty is a vibrant category that is currently growing above historical rates. With the outstanding performance we've seen year-to-date, we're again raising our full year guidance. However, we are mindful of a number of macro risks that remain concerning. These include uncertainties caused by political tensions and instability, as well as soft economies in certain markets. Given the strong performance to-date, we are raising our expectation for full year net sales growth to 10% to 11% in constant currency, excluding the impact of a new accounting standard. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 3 percentage points, reflecting rates of $1.14 for the euro, $1.297 for the pound and 6.808 for the yuan for the fiscal year. We expect the full year impact of the new accounting standard to be immaterial to net sales growth for the full year. We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $5.15 to $5.19 before restructuring and other charges. This reflects approximately $0.22 of dilution from currency translation and $0.06 accretion from the new accounting standard. In constant currency and with comparable accounting, this reflects EPS growth of 18% to 19%. For the fourth quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 9% to 10% in constant currency and using comparable accounting. Currency translation is estimated to dilute sales growth by approximately two percentage points, and the accounting change is forecasted to dilute an additional point. Therefore, we expect reported net sales to grow between 6% and 7%. We expect to increase investments substantially behind advertising and promotion to leverage our strong momentum and support our successful new product launches, as well as to increase investment behind recruitment in the US. This investment should also provide us with a strong start to our fiscal 2020. EPS is forecast to be between $0.45 and $0.49 before restructuring charges. This includes an approximate $0.04 dilution from currency and $0.04 from the new accounting standard. With two months left in the fiscal year, we remain encouraged by the momentum in global prestige beauty and our ability to effectively execute our strategy to generate profitable growth. Our outstanding performance represents continued investment behind the greatest opportunities in our business as well as our commitment to long-term sustainable growth. The additional financial flexibility we have gained through our Leading Beauty Forward program, the increasing strength of our operating cash flow and the greater returns we are achieving from our advertising investments position us well for continued success. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I was hoping to understand a little bit more about what you've been seeing in the North American market. I mean, the down 6% was worse than I think a lot of us were expecting. So, maybe if you can unpack some of the drivers whether you're still seeing Bon-Ton, maybe it was the pressure of government shutdown?  And then relatedly, could you talk a little bit more about what specifically you're seeing in the specialty multi-channel here in North America and then where are your investment as you think about Q4 kind of being driven? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay. Erinn, let me start as it relates to the Americas and really the U.S. prestige beauty market. So the prestige beauty was soft in the quarter. Actually, the share results that we get suggested it was actually down in the quarter. So -- and I think it's a combination of the things that you mentioned. Obviously, we're anniversarying the tax rebates. There was a lower level of promotion, which we believe is healthy, but clearly effects sales growth in the quarter. And we saw a bit of -- from our business, we saw a bit of destocking, but our business really trended with the market in terms of the performance in the market. Specialty multi globally was up, was up about 6%, and so we are still seeing good growth from that channel. Fabrizio, if you want to add anything? Fabrizio Freda : I just want to add that as you mentioned also Bon-Ton was still in our number the previous year so that's still one -- probably last quarter in which we have an impact of Bon-Ton. What I want to add is that at the end, the market was really down, the major market. There could be some part of the market -- actually in makeup that was in the non-major market, but at the end the major market and particularly brick-and-mortar was a tough quarter. Now we are pretty confident of our improvement plan in North America. And in fact, in quarter four, we are going to invest behind some exciting innovation that we believe will attract new fresh traffic. We are going to continue spending in the fast-growing channels, specialty and online particularly. We've just completed the field restructuring that will improve our ability to go-to-market. And we will start executing with excellence. The new consumer is targeting a granularity on marketing that we presented to them in the Investor Day. So, there are a lot of opportunity to first stabilize and then bring back to growth, also the U.S. market in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys, congrats and thanks for all the detail here today. Let me follow Erinn's question I guess a little bit with -- it looks like in the Americas, the operating income in the quarter -- it looks like the negative number is almost fully explained by the Smashbox, decision you made on the impairment. Could you maybe give us a little bit more of your thinking on Smashbox and you've obviously taken some accounting to that to try to right-size the brand in the financials here. But what do you think the brand needs going forward? And are we getting to a point where it can stop being as much of a drag to those U.S. numbers? It looked like they're quite a bit better when we exclude that. And then separately, I was wondering if you might be able to give us a little bit more behind your comment that -- I know you said you've got some new innovation coming that drives recruitment. Can I take that to mean that in the U.S. within the negative 6%, the new customer acquisition numbers have slowed as well? Any idea what the diagnosis looking backwards is there and what the epiphany is that you think you can spend back against to help reverse those trends in the fourth quarter? Fabrizio Freda : I'll start answering the second question and then we'll clarify the Smashbox thing is. No, actually, the consumer acquisition is -- what we are bringing back up, particularly young consumers and millennials. That we are making progress on most of the brands in acquiring new millennials and Gen Z consumers in the United States as well. As Tracey mentioned in this last quarter, there was a less promotionality on average and an overall lower market mean, it was just less traffic in the stores. But in term of our brands acquisition is pretty -- is improving. And as all my comments about our intention in quarter four and next year is actually to accelerate that. And we have a lot of tool, the granularity of targeting, the new innovation, the better exposed to growth channels and all the other elements we are putting -- including extra investment in advertising that we are putting in our United States turnaround plan. So we are pretty positive on the mid, long-term impact of those activities also in consumer acquisitions. On Smashbox, I want to clarify that the Smashbox is not the main reason for the decline. Smashbox is a relatively small brand in our total portfolio. Tracey Travis : From a sales perspective, right? Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. Tracey Travis : From a profit perspective, you're right that the impairment certainly did impact the profitability of the Americas segment. But from a sales perspective, as Fabrizio mentioned, it's not the main driver. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. I actually wanted to touch on your skincare margins in the quarter, which were still very strong. So hoping you guys could bucket maybe some of the key drivers for us in a bit more detail and then help us understand what the contributions might have been from the fast growth in certain geographies such as Asia versus maybe improvements you're seeing in the product mix from some of your innovation? Thanks. Tracey Travis : So let me start. Again, the margins on skin care are so strong, I would say first because the skin care category was up 25% in constant currency. So when you've got that kind of growth in the category, we see tremendous leverage across the board. That would be the first driver. Clearly, we're seeing great success as we called out in APAC and travel retail and leveraging that success in those regions, certainly helps from a margin standpoint as well. But it really when we've got a category growing at 25% that certainly justifies the kind of margin expansion that we're seeing in the skin care category. We've also had some terrific new innovations in the skin care category this year that we're quite excited about. So our innovation has continued to step up every year and this year in Estee Lauder and La Mer and Clinique, we've had terrific, terrific innovation and Origins as well. So all of our skin care brands are doing quite well, globally and certainly the strongest impact being in the Asia-Pac and travel retail region. Fabrizio Freda : And the only think I want to add is that our improved focus on hero products, meaning on the main proud, the main SKUs on every brand is also driving profitability over the medium, long-term, because it creates bigger products that can be better leveraged and better optimized and this trend will continue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : Hi, this is Javier. The question has to do again with North America, if you can help us understand the channel mix now in the U.S. with all the brands that you bought that tilt toward specialty channel. So basically if you can help us understand how important department stores is? What was the impact of Bon-Ton in the U.S., whether you can give us a sense of what was the growth in U.S. department stores ex-Bon-Ton? And also basically, how you are doing in the specialty channel? What is exposure? What is the growth rate? That will be helpful. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Any other question? Tracey Travis : So, Javier, department stores are still about half of the business in the U.S. And obviously, the growth that we're seeing is primarily in online and in specialty, but about half of the business is still in department stores -- little over half of the business is still, in department stores in the U.S. So still an important channel of distribution for us. The segment would have been negative without Bon-Ton. Bon-Ton was about $16 million of revenue in the quarter last year and obviously no sales this year. So that's the situation in the U.S. as it relates to the sales growth. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, and I just want to add, today, we have 75% of our business outside of the United States and we are super well diversified by channel, category, brands. And another thing I want to clarify, because I think we are definitely looking at markets like the United States, the U.K., China, and we have segmentation by geography. But if you look at our results this quarter by channel, globally every single channel has been growing. So you were asking about specialty-multi. Specialty-multi, we grew 6%, 7%. Department store globally, we're growing 2%. And TR and online and freestanding store and the way we look at, which is direct-to-consumer, which is a mix of brand dot-com and freestanding store, all growing double-digit -- at a very strong double-digit. If we look by categories, we've been growing every single categories, skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and within skin care as the previous question, every single subcategory of skin care like moisturizer, serums, everything is growing double-digit. In term of by brands, 80% of our brands, the exception is Smashbox and GLAMGLOW, but all our brands are growing more than double-digit, the large majority of them. So there is a lot of different engines of growth going on in our business in this moment. Segmenting the business, the way we segment it, also the way we operate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks, good morning. Tracey Travis : Morning. Lauren Lieberman : One of the things I wanted to ask, I'm sorry because I know Fabrizio you were just now emphasizing that U.S. is 25% of the business today. But I was still curious, I'm sorry about channel mix, because the mention of the sales restructuring struck a chord with me. I think for a few years I've sort of been thinking about your investments in the U.S. is being to sort of fully support traditional brick-and-mortar, being both your freestanding stores and department stores, while at the same time investing well ahead of the revenue build in kind of specialty-multi and online in totality. And with mentioning the sales restructuring, did suggest to me that all this kind of call it newer channels have reached scale to where you can perhaps start reallocating resources in the U.S. in a way that better suits the future growth. So I want to just I guess ask, one, is that a reasonable way about thinking where we are in terms of long-term channel mix shift? And then secondly, brand performance in the U.S. within those faster growing channels and versus the channels where the traffic isn't. What's your feeling on market share performance for your brands in those faster growth channels versus the more struggling part of the market? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : You're welcome. First of all, speaking about channel mix. As I said, we are -- Tracey just mentioned, we are 50% today we are in department stores and the remaining is in the fast growing channel. So we are tilting on a better balance or diversified by channel also in the United States, that's our strategy. This will continue to be. We are now better penetrated in specialty. We are in a very strong online across different both in retail dot-com and in brand dot-com. Our freestanding store are a significant channel in the United States. And obviously, department store continue to be an important part of our business. And in some areas we are growing and some department store are making some significant progress on the business. The real difference is brick-and-mortar versus online, so the brick-and-mortar are now growing and the online is growing. Even online in department store, online in retail dot-com. So all the online is continue to accelerate and that for us is very positive, because we see good market share in this area. Our brands are very successful in this area. So your other question was, are your brands successful in these new channels? Absolutely. I would say that our brands are even more successful in the new channels. Anyway, that's true in the United States, but that's true globally. I think in the Investor Day, we demonstrated our success in new channels like online globally, Tmall, travel retail, specialty-multi globally is really happening and we are definitely capable to drive these brands. Now we have a very big portfolio of brands, so some brands are better tailored to win in specialty, other brands are better tailored to a typical more department store environment. And finally, some brands are more prone to win online, and we manage this portfolio actually also to make sure that we always match the right brand, with the right channel, and with the right consumer target. And that's an art. That is not an average behavior. It's really a segmented way in which we manage our portfolio brands. That's why portfolio brands is a big competitive brand. Last comment -- your comment of our field sales force restructured. Absolutely. It was time to restructure our investment in field, in order to match and to go in parallel with a new distribution strategy, and with the new balance of the different channels. And absolutely, this is -- as part of this plan, we are increasing the resources and the focus and importantly, the skills on the new channels, in order to make our performance also in the new channels as strong as our historical performance is and has been in department stores. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Steph Wissink : Thanks, good morning everyone. Fabrizio, I just had a question for you on your comment on trailing 12-month launches that are 30% of sales, which I think you mentioned was the highest level. Can you give us some context of how that number has trended over the last few years? And how that connects to the advertising spend that you're doing kind of have fewer bigger launches with more focused advertising? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. This is a great strength that we've evolved in the last years. And is the fact that we have now multiple brands and every brand has its own innovation program, and the fact that we innovate in skin care and makeup and hair care and fragrances. And within every of this category, like skin care, we have very clear innovation programs by sub-category, example, moisturizer rather than masks, et cetera. So our granularity or our granular ability to look at opportunities make us now innovating across all these multiple global segments. That has increased the percentage of successful sales that we do via innovation. This strategy combined with hero product strategy, meaning, bigger innovations and fewer innovation and leveraging our historical franchises like Advanced Night Repair, [indiscernible] Clinique, the combination of those two strategy is making our innovation stronger, more abundant, and at the same time more profitable and efficient. And that's what I'm trying to say is the magic of our new innovation program. How this is linked? By the way, how was in the past? Last year was 20%, this year would be 30%, and when we started our strategy nine years ago, we were around 10%. So, we have tripled our innovation power in the last nine years. And how this -- and by the way this is indicated also by our results I believe. And how this is linked to our advertising investment is, the advertising -- what has changed with the arrival of the lot more digital advertising is that in the past we had few advertised brands. Clinique, Lauder, some fragrances and that was it. The other brands will live out of word of mouth and other activities and in store and obviously a lot of store activation. Today, every single brand is advertised. And that's what is creating also the acceleration. And so, our advertised brands -- our advertise investment today touch all our brands. And all our brands are reaching scale and levels to justify a part of their budget in advertising. And that obviously is a top-line accelerator, particularly when combined with innovation. And last, which is probably behind your question, yes, a lot of our advertising is focused on our innovation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning, guys. Tracey Travis : Good morning. Dara Mohsenian : So, Fabrizio, it's rare to see this level of corporate top line growth that you're expected to post this year. It's even rare to see it continue in subsequent years, when you cycle more difficult comparisons. So, I'd love to hear your viewpoint on sustainability of the strong top line growth, as we look out to next year? And specifically are there any signs of a potential slowdown in some of the key momentum areas that have been driving your business? And then also, just from a longer-term perspective, can you talk about how you've managed the business this fiscal year to sort of take advantage of the top line growth, and use it to propel longer term growth as you look beyond this year? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. The idea of growing ahead of market is definitely sustainable. We believe, we will continue to grow ahead of market and continue to build global market share. And the reason why this is a sustainable long-term view for us is assertive. Many will think I was just planning is because we are exposing our business to the fastest growth currents of the world. Thanks to Leading Beauty Forward, we have changed a lot in fixed costs and created variable OpEx. And these variable expenses, we can tailor them where the biggest opportunity at the speed of light. This was not possible in the past. So the first thing that make us sustainable that we can invest and allocate resources very fast with a lot of agility wherever the opportunity is. And so even in a world, which is more volatile and where the opportunity changes faster than in the past, we have now the agility to react with the same speed. And so this ability to match resources to opportunities is our strength. In this moment, the biggest opportunity, China, we are able and willing to invest in China in a great way. This has to change someday there will be other opportunity as we have demonstrated in the past where we will invest more. In this moment, our priority is to around the United States. We are going to invest in the United States and within the United States on the biggest opportunity, which are in the channels, by category, by channel, and by consumer segment. So this ability to granularly look at the opportunity and invest allocate resources on them is a sustainable long-term capability that we have built in our business that I believe will continue to drive our business ahead of market for many years to come. Do you want to add anything to it? Tracey Travis : No, I mean, the only -- couple of things that I would add, Dara is clearly, if you look at our history, over the past few years, you see that the fourth quarter is our lowest operating margin quarter, and it is somewhat related to the timing of some of our big innovation, and also related to, once we have seen how innovations perform during the course of the year, we take the opportunity to invest more behind them. And that provides us, has historically -- at least our experience provided us with a strong start to the next fiscal year. As Fabrizio said, we do expect that we will continue to grow ahead of market. The market last year, based on our information, grew around 7%. As we communicated at Investor Day, we do expect that the market will settle down at some point in the 5% to 6% range. So, we do expect that growth that we've seeing, the double-digit growth over the last few years in the next few years would slow as we expect that the market would slow. But we, in all cases, believe that we will continue to grow ahead of the market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the terrific results. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you. Tracey Travis : Thank you. Dana Telsey : As you think about your categories and just the makeup category, can you talk a little bit about how you see that progressing on the makeup side? What would change the direction of operating income there? Is there anything -- whether it's products, whether it's channels, geographies where there's a differentiation and how it's performing? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So let me start, Dana. Obviously the makeup category is impacted by some of the challenges that we discussed with Smashbox. We are seeing the M.A.C brand pickup, but obviously the M.A.C brand had been slow in the last year or so, so that has impacted the profitability of the makeup category. And fundamentally, again, when you think about the architecture of our P&L, growth drives a lot of margin expansion. So, to the extent that we see the makeup category growing globally, which we are growing relatively in line with the makeup category, but to the extent that we see that category pickup, certainly we'll see operating margin pickup. We expect operating margin will pickup anyway, given some of the innovation that we've got planned for some of our makeup brands like Too Faced, like M.A.C and some of our other brands as well, BECCA, et cetera, in the next few quarters. So we do expect that that will an improvement. But we do have some brands struggling in the category that's dragging the operating margin down. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. And our strong brand, whether it's growing the demand, the operating margin is very, very attractive. And so it's a matter of mix of brands that we'll correct over time. But also I wanted to clarify the market of makeup, is we go up and down. I mean, now is the skin care moment. But two years ago was the makeup moment. And by the way, this is different by region. In the U.S. clearly makeup is not a growing segment in this moment. But in Asia it is the fastest growing segment. Just to be clear, makeup in China, in the last quarter grew faster than skin care. And I'm not speaking about our business only; I'm speaking about the market. And so, makeup is a very strong category with a lot of future. And, when reached certain level of growth, we'll have the same positive impact on allowing us to leverage our cost structure that skin care has. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Q \u2013 Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everybody. A \u2013 Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Q \u2013 Mark Astrachan : I wanted to revisit the U.S. again and maybe ask the question in kind of a bit of a different way. How do you think about the brands and the channel mix today? Obviously department store is still half the business. Do you think you have what it takes to improve performance as it is? Is it just -- you mentioned increasing spend, but is that enough, do you think you need to do more selectively if available to go into different brands, channels, M&A that would buy things that could help you in that? Do you think maybe expanding into more active areas, things that maybe a bit more on trend from a consumer standpoint? And then just more broadly, when do you anticipate U.S. gets back to growth? A \u2013 Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. As we said, but we believe we have a great plan, as I said. The plan is about continuing get exposing different brands through the right channel, in the right target group. As you said, by brand, certain brands are really playing well in specialty. And they're playing well with the specialty customers. Other brands are perfect for department stores. It will continue to be exposed in the majority of the department stores, which are very important channels. And all of these brands are doing fantastic online and that we are continue building their specific targeting online. The innovation and the new exciting innovation that attract consumers, is going to be a key driver, continue to be a key driver of acceleration. And the other be segmentation, the ability to speak in a granular way to different segments of consumer, including multi-ethnic consumers around the U.S. is our plan. And we believe this mix of distribution, activation, innovation and granularity of marketing and the new area of segmentation, combined with a better field sales force; better focus by channel is our answer to restart growth. Obviously, we need to assume that the market overall will start growing back again. And that's what we also expect that the market will go back to growth. And when this will happen, which we believe next fiscal year, we do have the potential to go back to growth\u2026 Operator : Our\u2026 A \u2013 Fabrizio Freda : The last thing, sorry, I want to say. I want also to clarify that even that if that's happened, the impact in the short term on the overall trend of the total company is not very big. The real total -- the significant impact of the company is not in that turnaround from slightly declined to slight growth. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Q \u2013 Olivia Tong : Thanks, good morning. Want to talk a little bit about the operating expense, because excluding the change of the accounting impact there was quite a nice movement there. Did Leading Beauty Forward had an inflection point, because historically you've reinvested a significant portion of that, so maybe it's just timing but normally you don't flow that much of it through, so just trying to understand that a little bit better? Thank you. A \u2013 Tracey Travis :  No, we did have a great quarter of leverage, Olivia, in the third quarter, you're right. And Leading Beauty Forward absolutely contributed to that. So, as we had announced previously, we actually have increased our expectations for the program given the number of programs that have been added to the Leading Beauty Forward. And it is giving us more flexibility in our expense base. So we did see more leverage in some of the areas outside of advertising and promotion than what we had expected. And so, yes, we have more flexibility. We are still investing, though, a good portion of the savings of Leading Beauty Forward. Fabrizio mentioned, digital advertising, the digital capabilities in order to be able to do digital advertising. So the talent, the technology that we are investing in, to be able to both create the digital advertising as well as investing a lot more in our analytics capability as well. So we are using some of the savings to reinvest back in the business, to build capabilities that we need to have continued growth over the next few years. And that's working out well for us in the short-term, and we believe in the long-term as well. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Laraine A. Mancini: Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, the net gain on liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, changes in contingent consideration, the finalization of provisional charges related to the U.S. tax law enacted at the end of calendar 2017, and the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we will ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you Rainey and good morning everyone. We delivered another outstanding performance in fiscal year 2019 as our strategy based on multiple engine of growth continued to be a winning model. We have created more investment opportunities and improved our ability to quickly reallocate resources among different growth engines. Improved data analytics combined with our long-standing creativity fueled our successful product innovation and digital marketing which led to double-digit gains in net sales and adjusted earnings per share in all four quarters. For the year sales grew 12% once again above the rate of Global Prestige Beauty further strengthening our industry leadership. EPS climbed 21%, our second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. We finished the year with strong fourth quarter results driven largely by the same geographies, brands, and channels that fueled our performance in the previous quarters. We also had a modest improvement in trend in our U.S. business despite a tough environment. In fiscal 2020 we expect another year of strong above industry sales growth, margin expansion, and double-digit EPS gains. We believe Global Prestige Beauty will remain one of the most exciting consumer product areas driven by strong demographic trends and desirable products and we will remain completely focused on this sector. Our performance was not worthy considering the volatility and challenges in some of our most important markets. As you know they included trade tensions, uncertainty surrounding BREXIT in the UK, a difficult environment in North America with increased competition and slowing beauty sales overall, and certain department store challenges both in the U.S. and the UK. Thanks to excellent execution our talented employees worldwide managed through this environment to deliver strong results. Our broad based gains reflect diverse growth drivers, the desirability of our high quality products, compelling marketing, and innovation successes. In fiscal 2019 we continued to execute against our strategic priorities which powered our highest sales. Our skin care category was outstanding across brands, markets, and channels. The growing number of middle class consumers in China and other emerging markets embraced Prestige Beauty and they were avid users of our brands. We prioritize the investment in the fastest growing channels and Travel Retail and online continue to grow strong double-digits. Our direct to consumer business accelerated. Sales from new product innovation reached an all time high and our digital marketing and social media activations were highly effective. In addition our sales growth was supported by more than 380 million of cost savings and our Leading Beauty Forward initiative enabled us to invest more in advertising and other brands building areas. Tracey will give more details about this initiative in a few minutes.  Now I will highlight some of the factors that drove our improvements. Our 10 year compass forecasted continuing strong demand for skin care and we matched our innovations to the biggest opportunities across consumer segments and channels. One of our strategic priorities is to reach a wider range of consumers and several skincare launches including Clinique iD, attracted younger and more diverse shoppers. Our brands also attracted more diverse consumers through elevated marketing. Our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand created locally relevant bilingual communications to attract Latina consumers in key U.S. markets. During one such campaign for the brand's revitalizing supreme plus moisturizer sales to Latina consumers rose significantly and led to a 35% jump in sales for that product. Looking at our geographies our strategy of serving the growing middle class in many emerging markets with locally relevant products was highly successful. Sales rose in virtually all of our emerging markets worldwide led by China, India, the Middle East, including Turkey and Southeast Asia countries. And as a group they grew over 30%. Our growth in China was outstanding. All categories and channels grew and virtually all brands posted double-digit gains. Our online sales rose significantly in China and we introduced our Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London brands on TMall. Tom Ford was our biggest launch to date on the platform.  We continued to expand our business in the fastest growing channels during calendar 2018, our company became number one in Prestige Beauty in Travel Retail worldwide. And throughout fiscal 2019 we had broad based growth across our top brands, regions, and categories in the channel. Growth was primarily driven by robust like doors gains and expanded targeted reach also contributed. The Pretail business where passengers can order products online and pick them up at the airport upon their departures or return has taken off strongly. Pretail is centered in Asia for now but is expected to grow worldwide.  Our online growth was also broad-based and as brand sites, retailer sites, and third party sites all grew double-digits. We increased our brand presence on select third party malls and sites and our brands enter new markets. The priority of our online business comes from our three largest markets the U.S., China, and the UK. However in total our smaller online markets had become an increasing meaningful contributor to growth. Our online sales in countries such as Spain or Greece, Israel and India are expanding rapidly and hold great promise for the future. Our online sales grew at least double-digit in everyone of the approximately 50 markets where we have by now e-commerce operations.  Our brand sites are more than a platform to sell products. They are valuable media properties. They collectively attracted this year more than 400 million visits allowing our brands to engage with consumer through rich storytelling, elevated assets, and high touch experiences. This builds equity and loyalty which creates value that extends to sales in other channels. Data driven marketing will make these sites even more compelling as we tailor our messages to different consumers. Our brand sites together with third party platform and our freestanding stores in brick and mortar comprise our direct to consumer business which rose sharply. The three channels combined had approximately 1.3 billion visits last year and we are leveraging them as equity building platforms. Our product innovation was powered by capabilities we have developed in data analytics and consumer insights. Combining data with our creative process resulted in terrific innovation success. Our new product launches reached a record penetration, about one third of net sales. In addition the number of success launches increased as did our speed to market. Our innovation was focused on bigger, more impactful products in large part supporting our hero franchises. We continue to focus our advertising spending on digital marketing and social media to strengthen brand equity, drive repeat purchase, and generate trial. Digital now comprises nearly 75% of our media spend, it was highly expected. For example, in China the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was ranked a genius brand for the third straight year and La Mer was number one in global engagement in luxury skincare.  By making progress across our strategic priorities we drove higher sales throughout our portfolio. For the year brands represent more than 80% of our total net sales posted increases as they attracted new consumers and improved retention rates. Three of our four largest brands each with sales well over $1 billion grew strongly globally. Fueled by its popular hero franchises our largest brand Est\u00e9e Lauder had terrific success. Our sales rose more than 20% for the second year in a row with double-digit gains in skincare and makeup. It posted highest sales in all regions additionally all channels. La Mer products and digital communication attracted many new consumers. It generated double-digit growth in every region. In Asia Pacific it was the fastest growing top 10 brands in Prestige Beauty. Strong innovation in product and marketing accelerated Mac's global growth and its makeup offsetting were particularly well-received in Travel Retail and all over in Asia. Clinique focused its innovation on moisturizers, a high usage and high loyalty subcategory which drove the brand skincare business higher in every region.  Two key launches where Clinique iD a breakthrough innovation that led consumer customize their moisturizer and Moisture Surge Eye Concentrate which helps the Moisture Surge franchise grow very strongly. We also strengthen our portfolio of small and mid-sized brands and our luxury brands resonated strongly. By focusing on developing high quality products, communicating our brands authenticity, and strengthening our repeat purchases rates. We successfully scaled our brands and added $1.2 billion in incremental sales to the top line. Strong demand enable us to raise prices across our portfolio which contributed two percentage points of sales growth.  During the year we also committed to delivering greater value through our citizenship and sustainability programs. We announced new goals at our Investor Day and are continuing to incorporate our efforts throughout our brands, regions, and functions, as well as on corporate level. Recently we added a Corporate Responsibility Scorecard on our website to track our initiatives. We have been recognized for our achievements including being named number one on Forbes list of the best employers for women and included in Barron's top 100 sustainable companies. We celebrated 25 years of Mac Viva Glam campaign which has cumulatively raised that 500 million to help people with AIDS and HIV in more than 100 countries.  Finally with our strong cash position and financial success we raised the dividends by double-digits for the tenth consecutive year. Fiscal year 2019 was a fantastic year yet even more significant is the progress we have made since we launched our current strategy a decade ago. Let me recap some of our key accomplishments. Since 2009 our net sales more than doubled from 7 billion to nearly 15 billion rising on average 8% a year which is the top of our long-term goal. EPS growth averaged 21% two and a half times our sales growth. Our share of Global Prestige Beauty reached 15.3% up 2.3 points making us the clear global leader. Our total shareholder return topped 1100%. Total cash returned to stockholders exceeded 10.5 billion and cash flow from operations skyrocketed from 700 million to 2.5 billion.  In addition to these financial results we further diversified our business and built a more flexible financial model. We developed processes to drive more collaborative teamwork and invested in human capital including recruiting external talent to bring fresh perspectives. Our workplace is now more diverse and inclusive and we amplified our family values. These changes have created a more streamlined integrated organization and a stronger foundation that we believe will enable us to continue our growth trajectory. As we start fiscal year 2020 we are continuing to adapt our strategy to reflect a continuously changing environment. We plan to fuel our strengths in the brands, categories, channels, and geographies that are performing well, accelerate growth in areas that are underperforming to turn them around and with the guidance of our compass and utilizing data and technology anticipate new opportunities and trends as they emerge and act on them quickly.  Our over arching goal is to reach diverse global consumers of all ages and reinforce our connection with loyal users. To do this we will prioritize growth in the emerging markets and fast growing channels, strengthen our hero franchises, and create new ones, engage through our social media, and reach digital assets and expand our omnichannel capability to seamlessly connect our online and offline businesses. In addition we are striving to stabilize our North America business despite the current soft environment. We believe our creativity and innovation will continue to attract and retain consumers. Our innovation program is focused on expanding our hero franchises across our categories. In our largest one skincare some new products include Clinique Smart Clinical MD a moisturizer that visibly risk out and revolumize and a reset concentrate in Est\u00e9e Lauder advanced retail line. The luxury segment in skin care is among the fastest growing which is why our high end Tom Ford beauty brands is launching its skincare collection to complement its very popular makeup and fragrance lines. And La Mer is launching a Neck and D\u00e9collet\u00e9 Concentrate and updating the regenerating serum.  We expect continued strong growth in China and in other emerging markets including India, Turkey, Southeast Asia as we tap into the growing middle class with our desirable brands. We will expand online in these markets to reach consumers who don't have brick and mortar distribution options and offer more locally relevant products. We believe China's growth will remain strong although we expect some deceleration from the rapid pace of the last two years. But as China's growth moderates we expect other emerging markets to contribute more. Likewise we expect our Travel Retail business to continue to be a growth catalyst. But we are anticipating our growth rate to moderate. We also are intent on turning around the parts of our business that aren\u2019t performing to our expectations. Prestige Beauty in North America and the UK remains somewhat soft especially makeup where we are a leader. That said we aim at improving our performance this year as we further rebalance our channel mix and win in key subcategories. We will build on our leadership position in Prestige Beauty by targeting a broader range of consumers within local areas and creating compelling campaigns.  As we embark on the second decade of our strategy we are focused on winning today while at the same time continue transforming our business to lead in the future. Maintaining our leadership in such a dynamic industry requires constant reinvention which has been a hallmark of our company for decades. We are optimistic about the outlook for Prestige Beauty and foresee continued healthy growth, thanks to favorable demographic especially in emerging markets and a continued shift from Mac to Prestige. As the best diversified player in Prestige Beauty we are in a unique position to capture greater global share. Nonetheless we are confident that in the short-term economical, social, and geopolitical uncertainties could impact our results.  In closing I want to thank our leadership team and our highly talented employees all over the world for delivering such a terrific year. Throughout our brands and function our employees excelled in their roles and successfully navigated difficult environments. These skills differentiate our company and our people to give us a competitive advantage. We are proud that we have much to celebrate but more importantly we are excited about our bright future ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you for Fabrizio and good morning everyone. As a reminder my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and now for the quarter results. Net sales for the fourth quarter rose 12% with strong growth in our international regions and growth across all product categories. We saw a continuation of the outstanding growth in China and Travel Retail that we saw throughout the year and North America improved slightly. Our Asia Pacific region continued its strong net sales growth this quarter up 23% with all product categories rising double-digits. Nearly all markets grew and more than half of the markets grew double-digit. Regarding China, the continuation of robust growth reflects the superb execution of new innovation along with strong digital advertising campaigns. Nearly every brand rose strong double-digits in China as did all channels. Among the other large markets in the region Hong Kong rose double-digits and both Japan and Korea rose mid-single-digits. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region rose 20% led by a strong double-digit increase in global Travel Retail. International passenger traffic remains strong particularly in Asia and our travel themed collections sold particularly well. The EMEA region also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets led by Russia, Turkey, and India. The Middle East rose sharply following an inventory rebalancing in the prior year quarter. Growth in Western European markets was mixed. Increases in Italy, Greece, and France were partially offset by modest declines in the UK and Benelux. Net sales in the Americas declined 4% reflecting a slight improvement in North America trend compared to our prior third quarter. Prestige Beauty overall in North America continued to be soft particularly in the makeup category. We achieved double-digit net sales growth online with contributions from both retailer and brand sites but we're challenged in brick and mortar retail. Latin America's net sales declined as growth in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru was more than offset by declines in Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela. Skincare again led product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 19% with continued strong increases from the Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands globally. Est\u00e9e Lauder sales were driven by success in our hero franchises notably advanced night repair, nutritious, perfectionist, and micro essence where the franchise benefited from the launch of its micro essence with Sakura Ferment in Asia. La Mer had success from the relaunch of the concentrate and garnered increased awareness through its global Blue Heart campaign supporting clean oceans. Net sales in makeup grew 8% led by strong demand in Asia and Travel Retail. Many brands contributed to growth particularly Tom Ford beauty, Mac, and Too Faced.  Tom Ford lips and eye makeup drove growth and the brand launched a Cushion Compact Foundation in China supporting foundation as another strong pillar of growth for the Tom Ford brand. Tom Ford Beauty's recent launch on TMall also contributed to make up growth. Mac resonated well across Asia, several EMEA markets and Travel Retail and grew sharply in the Middle East due largely to anniversarying in inventory reset in the prior year quarter. Too Faced growth was broad based geographically driven by the successful launch of Damn Girl Mascara. The brand also continued its global expansion adding Doors and Travel Retail in Hong Kong during the quarter. Fragrance net sales rose 3%. Higher sales of Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and Lullaby Fragrances were partially offset by declines in certain designer brand fragrances. Tom Ford signature fragrances maintained good momentum. Jo Malone London launched Frangipani Fragrance with its blossom collection and Lullaby continued to selectively expand its global reach while maintaining strong like door growth. Our hair care sales rose -- net sales rose 1%. Higher net sales from Aveda Shampure, rosemary mint, and cherry almond lines select new doors in Italy and strong growth online were mostly offset by soft U.S. sales from Bumble and Bumble. Our gross margin decreased 230 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year and increased 10 basis points excluding the change in accounting. Favorable pricing and mix impacts were mostly offset by higher obsolescence and shipping costs to support the strong growth in Asia. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 240 basis points or 50 basis points excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. Increases in advertising to support new initiatives were more than offset by savings and selling in-store operations.  Operating income rose 10% and operating margin increased by 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of a new accounting standard, operating income rose 17% and operating margin improved by 60 basis points. This was achieved even while making strategic investments to support a strong start to fiscal 2020. Diluted EPS of $0.64 increased 5% compared to the prior year and grew 8% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS excluding the impact of the accounting change was $0.68, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year or 15% in constant currency.  So that concludes remarks regarding our fourth quarter. Let me now discuss a few highlights of our full year results. Net sales were 12% in constant currency. Growth was broad based as you have heard from Fabrizio. Aside from the diverse growth by brand, market, and product category our sales in virtually all channels grew. Travel Retail and online continued to deliver strong double-digit growth further diversifying our overall distribution mix. These channels now represent 23% and 15% of sales respectively. Department stores globally represent 35% of sales today with North America department stores now 13% of our global sales mix.  Our gross margin declined 200 basis points to 77.4% but rose 10 basis points excluding the impact of the accounting change. Favorable pricing and mix were partially offset by increased obsolescence. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 300 basis points or 70 basis points excluding the impact of the accounting change. Significant savings and efficiencies in our selling model allowed us to increase digital advertising, social media, and influencer outreach. Our full year operating margin rose 90 basis points to 17.5%. This margin included 20 basis points of favorable impact from the accounting change offset by 20 basis points of dilution from currency translation. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and ongoing cost savings initiatives contributed more than 380 million in savings which fueled the strategic investments that will support our future growth. We have continued to create more flexibility in our cost structure to reinvest in areas that support profitable growth, mitigate risk, and deliver margin expansion through greater leverage of our cost base. Our effective tax rate for the year was 21.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points over the prior year primarily driven by the lower U.S. statutory rate. Net earnings grew 17% to $2 billion and diluted EPS rose 18% to $5.34. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.19 from currency translation and positively impacted by $0.04 from the accounting change. Excluding both of these items earnings per share rose 21% for the year.  In fiscal 2019 we recorded approximately $190 million after tax or $0.51 per share in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives. As of June 30th we concluded the approval of all major initiatives under the program and we expect to substantially complete all of them by the end of fiscal 2021. We now expect to incur charges of between 950 million and 990 million before taxes and achieve annual net benefits of between 425 million and 475 million before taxes. Leading Beauty Forward has been an unqualified success. The scope of the program grew over time to approximately 70 initiatives and encompassed most of the organization. Some examples of the transformation achieved by Leading Beauty Forward include improved global customer care that leverages new technology and enhance customer data to deliver a seamless cross-channel brand experience and more personalized care, integrated shared services across the business through our One Source Service Center. One Source delivers a suite of services across H.R., legal, finance, and point of sale support. Services are delivered through a mobile friendly portal for ease of use by employees around the world. Modernizing the North America field organization to provide best in class consumer services and experiences and exceptional retail partnerships. New centers of excellence together with new tools enable our field teams to spend more time in store to drive sales and coach talent and expanding indirect procurement efforts to new categories of spending and using enhanced technology to accelerate our savings opportunities. These are just a few of the key wins to date and they are not only producing expense savings but changing the way we work to drive sales and improve the customer experience. Moving on to cash flows, cash generated from operations was slightly below last year at 2.5 billion reflecting our earnings growth and offset by higher inventory to support the rapid growth and longer lead time international markets, the timing of other working capital components and higher cash paid for taxes. We utilize 744 million for capital improvements primarily for consumer facing counters, gondolas, and e-commerce support as well as supply chain improvements in IT. We return cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace. We repurchased 11 million shares of our stock for 1.6 billion twice as much as the prior year. We paid 609 million in dividends reflecting a 13% increase in our dividend rate. So as Fabrizio said, we are obviously pleased and proud of our fiscal 2019 results and the momentum our overall business has throughout the year. Looking ahead to our expectations over the next few years, Global Prestige Beauty has been exceptional in recent years and we expect it to rise again in the range of 6% to 7% annually over the next few years driven by a growing middle class globally with increasing disposable incomes. Our net sales goal is to grow 6% to 8% annually with possibly 1% of the growth over three years coming from acquisitions. Over the next three years we continued to target average annual margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points and double-digit EPS growth.  Now let's take a look at our expectations for fiscal 2020 full year and first quarter. As we enter our fiscal 2020 we must consider the escalating macro issues that could have an impact on our business. The ongoing tension and unresolved trading terms between the U.S. and China, the looming concern and consequences of a hard BREXIT in October, and recent protests in Hong Kong and other markets are all examples of factors that could impact our fiscal 2020 results. For the year, net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency at the upper end of our long-term goal of 6% to 8%. Pricing is expected to contribute approximately two points to growth, expanded targeted consumer reach is expected to add two to three points of growth, and the strength of our existing business will account for the remainder. Strong growth in Travel Retail in China is expected to continue yet moderate as we anniversary two years of extraordinary growth and with the increasing macro and geopolitical uncertainty. We also aim to stabilize the brands and regions that were more challenging in fiscal 2019 and position them for future growth. All product categories are expected to grow again with greater balance and growth among the categories. Based on June 28th spot rates of 1.14 for the euro, 1.27 for the pound, and 6.88 for Yuan we expect currency translation to have a negligible impact on reported sales for the full fiscal year. This will obviously change if the currency markets becomes more volatile. We expect to deliver productivity savings of between 2% and 2.5% of sales including benefits from Leading Beauty Forward and our ongoing cost containment efforts. These savings give us the flexibility to invest more in digital marketing and advertising to support innovation, recruit new consumers, and drive brand awareness as we expand our developing brands into new markets and focus more heavily on emerging markets outside of China.  With the leverage from strong top line growth and our ongoing cost saving programs we are well positioned to make needed investments for the future while also delivering margin expansion. We estimate that the fiscal 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 23%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $5.90 and $5.98 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 11%. In fiscal 2020 we expect cash flow from operations of approximately 2.7 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 900 million or 5% to 6% of sales as we invest more in our supply chain, enable enhanced consumer experiences, and invest in facilities to optimize our workspaces. Our sales in the first quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10% both as reported and in constant currency. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.56 to $1.59 including a penny of accretion from currency translation. EPS growth in constant currency is forecast to rise by 10% to 12% for the first quarter.  In closing while we are cautious about the increased macro tensions we remain confident about the continued momentum behind Global Prestige Beauty and our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives. We continue to create increased flexibility in our expense base, to invest behind the greatest opportunities we have, to continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. The flexibility in our P&L and our increasing cash flow generation also position as well to navigate a more volatile environment. And with that I'll conclude our prepared remarks and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Group. Your line is open. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. I guess my question has to do with the U.S. business specifically. Everything else is just going so great, but it just seems that that business is stubborn in terms of turning around and growing for you. So I guess number one specifically in your guidance for full year 2020, what are you expecting, what's baked in to your outlook for the U.S. business specifically, and what do you think it takes to get growth not just for you but the category overall, are you taking too much pricing, is there too much competition, and you need to buy a bunch of smaller brands, do you need to exit more department stores, what do you think fixes the problem there? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay, Wendy, so I'll start in terms of what's included in our guidance and I'll let Fabrizio speak about what we're doing to improve the North American business. So in terms of our guidance we are expecting a slight improvement from fiscal 2019 in terms of North America. Remember that part of the challenge we had in North America in fiscal 2019 was the closure of Bon-Ton so that certainly cost us about a point of growth in North America. And we continued throughout the year to work on a number of different changes in our organization in order to position ourselves well for future growth. But it's obviously a pretty dynamic environment in North America given the soft traffic. So with that I'll turn it over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, I think your question Wendy is what was the -- the issue is still that we have 50% of business in North America in a part of the market which is under pressure in terms of low traffic and declining business. And so what is happening is that this wing to the high growth areas is taking time, particularly it is taking time because the overall environment is very soft as you heard from everyone in North America. Just to give you an example, in our global Travel Retail business which is going fantastically well in Asia and in Europe is flat to declining in the U.S. So it is really the U.S. environment overall which is under pressure and that's why it is taking a bit more than what we wanted. So what we have in mind for fiscal year 2020 is stabilization of our business. We believe first of all we have seen some progress already in quarter four where we have started investing particularly on Mac and Clinique and we have seen some sequential improvement.  Also I want to underline that the launch of Damn Girl of Too Faced in the U.S. make Too Faced grow nearly 30% in a very tough quarter for makeup in the country so showing the power of this brand. And there are many other positive sign. In the strategy we already explained in the past meaning our strategy to work more online which is growing by the way very well continue to build our specialty channel and obviously invest more in innovation which is specific to the subcategories which are relevant in the U.S. And we are doing this very well with some initial success. So in net I am very optimistic for the long-term ability to make U.S. again a growing business for us. But it will be good one day to be helped by less soft environment to accelerate the speed of that process. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning guys. So my question was around top line. First I guess just short-term, you highlighted the top line guidance for fiscal 2020 included a number of [external] [ph] risk factors in the U.S., UK, Hong Kong, and China. Yet you're still at the high end of your long term sales growth outlook. So I was just hoping you could parse out a bit more detail for what you've assumed along those risk factors given some of them looks like they could be sizable and perhaps directly comment on Hong Kong so far this quarter since that's played out to some extent?  And then second from a longer term strategic standpoint on top line, we've clearly seen very strong growth rates from Prestige Beauty in China but a couple of years ago we had seen an acceleration in the U.S. Prestige Beauty market particularly in make up behind social media, e-commerce, sales, etc. Now that looks like it's rapidly dissipated. So I just love to get your view on sustainability of the key growth drivers of Prestige Beauty in China and understanding that U.S. is a very different market if that might have some application to China as you think about the growth rates longer-term? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, let me start answering the second question. I mean I think you made the point that the world of makeup and skincare I think is already volatile. Meaning that depending on consumer trends you could see growth in a certain category in another in a given market or in other. So the strengths of our strategy is exactly what we have defined as multiple engines abroad. So our ability to fast allocate resources and strengths to whatever is growing in a given moment. So when U.S. was growing strongly in makeup we leveraged that growth at that time with Mac particularly in the brands. Now we are leveraging the growth of skincare in Asia and as these trends will evolve gradually over the years we will be able to focus on the fastest growing growth elements. So that's exactly at the heart of our strategy and at the heart of our resource allocation strategy. Said that, the growth of skincare in Asia is here to stay for the long-term and again there could be moments of volatility here and there depending on the situation around the markets. But it is definitely a very strong long-term trend because Asian consumers are very heavy users of skincare. They're very interested in high quality products and most importantly the Asian consumer using skincare are much younger, and so each consumer you conquer in skin care in Asia has much higher life value than what happens in other markets of the world. That's why this is definitely a long-term trend.  As far as the makeup situation in the U.S. the makeup situation is at the exclusion of makeup in the U.S. some years ago, it was also driven by the explosion of social media and by the enormous availability of how to do videos all of a sudden online [indiscernible] consumers. Now this phenomenon, its currently now has reached a plateau and stabilized. That's why now makeup will need to continue growing based on the historical trends by the way are the strongest strengths we have which is quality of product, quality [notation] [ph], and continuous brand building. So in summary I believe that the sustainability of the growth that you see is there and that's why we believe that that our 6% to 8% overall long-term growth is sustainable and will be sustainable for a long-term. Tracey Travis : And I would just add Dara in terms of how to think about our guidance for the year, China and Travel Retail are expected to still grow double-digit, just not as strong a double-digit as they've grown in the last couple of years so again reflecting some moderation. The comfort that we have in guiding at the higher end of our range is recognizing now everything that Fabrizio just said in terms of the middle class and the growth of the middle class and the consumption behavior as it relates to Prestige Beauty. The fact that emerging markets now and faster growing channels are a higher percentage of penetration of our business, so we are benefiting more from the momentum of those markets and we are less exposed to some of the slower growth channels in particular than we have been historically. So yes, while a moderation is certainly the right guidance for us this year given everything that's going on in the environment, we're still very comfortable with a 7% to 8% top line growth. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from Macquarie. Your line is open. Caroline Macquarie : Thank you so much. Good morning and congratulations on an exceptional decade Fabrizio and the team. You know despite everything that's been going in China and Hong Kong it's just unbelievable to see this mixed management that's just driving your business. And I'm wondering Fabrizio if you could help us understand some of the actions you're taking within China and Hong Kong to protect against any negative fallout from what's going on at a high level because it obviously looks a little out of control from this side but your Hong Kong data was phenomenal, everything looks great in your business, so just a little help on that would be great? Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, I mean we are learning from what we see and how we manage reality. Let me give you Hong Kong examples. Hong Kong had another moment of protest and crises few years ago as you remember. In that moment coming out of the moment we realized that our Hong Kong business was a bit more disposed to tourists and not having enough high penetration on local. In the last year during the recovery of Hong Kong we had actually readjusted that. Today our business in Hong Kong which by the way Hong Kong including Travel Retail is less than 4% of our business globally at this point. This is also because of the strong growth of China and the others, that's the percentage today. And it is much more local than used to be. So for example how we are mitigating Hong Kong protest risk in this moment. First is that we have seen that when the tourist don't shop, they shop somewhere else. So we are working to recover part of that potential loss from tourist in other markets. Second, today we have a bigger share of local business and local business is less subject to this kind of protest because people still buy what they need to live in a normal way locally. And so we are mitigating that with good local activity and local marketing and local relevant products. And in doing all of this we also have today the ability to reallocate resources to the trends meaning financial resources, invest more or less in a given category in either area. Even by area in places in Hong Kong we have the flexibility to invest more or less by area. To give you another example Macau is not affected in this moment by the turmoil in the business. So that's the kind of things that make us more capable of mitigating volatility that we have seen historically and it is all being developed strategically. However, I want to close on my example of -- our priority in this moment in Hong Kong is actually the safety of our employees and of our consumers. And that's where we are focusing our efforts and that's where we definitely manage our priorities in the market.  On China, I mean China we've been investing in China for the long-term and we are in China for the long-term. We have over 6000 employees, basically 99.5% Chinese. We are very local in everything we do. We are locally relevant, we have local activities. Like any other area of the world we are a local relevant organization in everything we do. And so we mitigate the risks with local presence, local relevancy, and again with our ability to invest in the market we are investing substantially in the many emerging markets particularly in China. And these investments are important to the countries we participate in. So that's the way we are mitigating. We are a truly global company which are local in every market we operate in and very respectful of every kind of consumer and market dynamic we see around the world. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Strycula : Hi, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So a quick question on the UK. We haven't spent as much time focusing in there but for context should we think about that being around 8% to 10% of company sales, what have you noticed anything in terms of change in consumer confidence in the local marketplace and how do you source products and manufacture them for that region? Fabrizio Freda : So first of all -- is less than 10% to 8% of the company, it is more in the range of 5% of the company sales, our UK business. And the potential impact of a hard BREXIT as of October as it is planned is already included in our guidance and that's in fact one of the risks that we see globally that we are including in our guidance and that has to do with the moderation of the growth thus in our guidance versus the current trend by quarter in the last year. So UK is -- then we are very well organized. In case of a hard BREXIT we are ready to operate. So we have done all the investment needed to make sure we are ready to operate our business in both situations. And finally we believe that the UK will continue to be mitigated by the fact that the hard BREXIT risk which has obviously a risk on local consumption on the other side has an impact on the currency that you're seeing which is benefiting the tourism and our sales to tourists in the UK which is an upsetting factor. That's why we forecast in moderation but not a dramatic one. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, hello everybody. And I echo the congratulations to all on your results. Could you please elaborate on the traffic and the conversion in Travel Retail which I remember you discussed on the Analysts Day there has been -- the conversion has been very strong. But can you update us on the most recent trends and as a follow-up to that we also saw an increase in inventory and I understand that you always wanted to increase the service levels especially because of the growth in Asia. But is it also related to any deceleration or inventory level given the volatility there? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So, you want to take it. Tracey Travis : Yeah, I'll start with the inventory. So no, it's not related to any recent deceleration, it really is because of two years of outstanding growth that we've had and where much of that growth has come from which is in Asia and Travel Retail. So that certainly raises are in transit inventory levels and certainly raises our inventory levels. Inventory is and we've talked about it for a number of years. So the good news is we've been able to make quite a bit of progress in terms of cash, cash generation, and cash flow from operating earnings over a two year time horizon even without having benefits from inventory turnover. We've made a lot of progress in terms of the working capital elements of accounts payable in particular and you might recall that last year our cash flow growth grew over 40%. So while it was flattish this year largely because of because of inventory, we have and are putting more sophisticated processes in place to improve the accuracy of our forecasting and certainly looking at supply as well in terms of getting supply bit closer to demand in the future. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, and on Travel Retail is -- first of all our Travel Retail business has been growing very strongly. Also last quarter we saw no slowdown in retail. And the growth has been as I said before very strong indeed back in EMEA and actually there was a decline in the Americas. And the business is growing across all brands and the most important concept is that the same doors are the fastest growing part of the business. So our Travel Retail business is growing because we are winning market share in same doors. We are adding new distribution where relevant particularly new brands that we are deploying to the channel and that the channel is requesting. And importantly as you said we are increasing conversion of traveler into buyers, into shoppers. The conversion continued to improve. We are not going to give specific numbers on conversion but continues to grow. One of the key driver of conversion is the success of the pretail system where consumers can order online and then take the products in the airports.  This is growing very well in Asia particularly for the time being we forecast that this will be a global methodology to buy in this channel in the future. This is obviously driving conversion because consumers -- you know some consumer arrive to the airport late, arrive to the airport stressed, doesn't want to shop, they want to go to a lounge or they want to do other things. And the farther you can buy online before going and then getting there actually is increasing the amount of consumers which are willing to buy something in the airport and that's one. The other big thing that we are driving, we are doing to drive conversion is the advertising in the airports and that's very important and drives obviously conversion.  But the most important of all drivers are the investment we are making in the country of origin of all our products. You know the travelers they shop the best, tend to be the one from emerging markets. So Chinese as we know, the Russian, Brazilians, Middle Eastern, and that the hour in new investment and accelerated investment in emerging markets have an indirect positive impact from the fact that those travelers when they travel they also want to buy the brands in their visiting airports or in visiting countries where they go. So the big driver is our increased investment in the country of origin which is accelerating the face of our Travel Retail business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is open. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys. So if I look at your guidance 78% constant currency for 2020 on the top line and then 9% to 11% constant currency pour on the EPS line. And I compare that to fiscal year 2019 whereas 12% of the top line and a large gap 21% growth on the EPS line excluding ASC and other stuff. If I go to 2018 it was 13% of the top line and then 24% on the EPS line. So lots of leverage between the top line and the bottom line, the big gap in growth for 2018 and 2019 but less so for 2020, and I just want to get a better sense of why that might be, is it being careful of changes in the mix of the categories or geographies, is it that you expect incrementally more investments and if so where? And I particularly ask that in the context of extremely successful Leading Beauty Forward savings and continue rationing it up there. So that's kind of a shorter-term part of that investment question but then the longer-term part is really just getting a sense of whether you think your current broad investment levels given how you've been able to kind of react more quickly to markets, whether the current investment levels you think are the right ones for your long-term aspiration of continued market share growth in the category as the Prestige Beauty industry evolves? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Alright so let me start and then Fabrizio can join in. You know really the difference Ali between fiscal 2019 where we grew top line at 12% and our fiscal 2020 where we're guiding 7% to 8%, the incremental leverage that we get on the incremental sales that four or five point of sales is highly accretive. So we -- and one of the things to your point that we've been working on under Leading Beauty Forward is to make sure that incremental sales are more and more accretive to the bottom line. So that's really the difference in terms of the margin expansion that we saw in fiscal 2019 relative to what our guidance is in fiscal 2020. You know as it relates to our investment levels, we certainly continued to invest to support -- we have a portfolio of 30 brands, they are at all different stages of development and we also have emerging markets that we're investing in as well in terms of driving brand awareness and with consumers. So, we certainly expect that we want to have the flexibility when the opportunity is there to invest behind those brands and behind those markets from a growth standpoint. But as Fabrizio said, when the growth isn't there for whatever reason we also have the flexibility to pull back and we have more of that flexibility today than we have had previously.  But when you think about what we've done with our expense base over the last few years with our cost saving programs and with Leading Beauty Forward, we have significantly diversified our portfolio. We've expanded into new channels of distribution and we've done that while continuing to drive margin. Those new channels of distribution required investment. The same thing with new markets, as we've expanded brands into new markets that too has required investment. So all of the work that we've done over the decade that Fabrizio spoke about in his prepared remarks really has been quite remarkable in terms of our ability to manage to continue to drive margin, continue to allocate more investments in the right areas to drive top line growth going forward. And we expect that we will continue to be able to do that in the future. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, and just very clear. The only thing I would add on the investment side is that over time we have invested much more in advertising and now I would say that every one of our brands has some investment depending on where they are and how, which part of investment. These investment are mainly now in digital. 75% of our investment now are in digital social media influencers and they're revealing to be highly productive. And now they're highly productive because we are doing a very good job in advertising, quality on asset, in targeting but frankly they're very productive because we have learned much better how to focus our investment where there is growth. Because when you expose your investment to growth they have a much better rate of return. And that's what is happening in this moment and that's what we manage daily. We did that accuracy but frankly we didn't have available in the past. And also want to underline it why we have increased our advertising. We have kept our promotions flat and why we have increased our advertising and kept our promotion flat, we have delivered 90 points of margin improvements showing that we have been capable of reallocating cost and taking cost out of the fixed areas into the variable areas which again is one of the key driver of the flexibility I am speaking about in resource allocation. So, in net I personally believe that what we have done with advertising investment in our P&L is one of the key driver of our recent acceleration and is going to be one of the key driver of our sustainable success in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks, good morning. Tracey Travis : Good morning Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : I wanted to talk a little bit actually about Leading Beauty Forward and then also other kind of ongoing productivity efforts which may not be end of that bucket. But I guess first would be that specific to Leading Beauty Forward I think statements came in ahead of guidance this year, you raised slightly the expected savings range versus what you have been articulating at the Analyst Day. So I wanted to hear a little bit about what's driving that upside surprise in Leading Beauty Forward? And then you mentioned ongoing productivity also contributing in fiscal 2020. So if you could talk about areas where that work is coming through because I think for retail all the points that you've just made around investing in new channels and new markets there's also the other side of that equation which is reaching a point where you can kind of take resources away from some of the slower or no growth areas of the business. So I want to talk a little bit about that shift that I think is kind of at that inflection point? Thanks. Tracey Travis : Okay, so let me start. In terms of the upside from Leading Beauty Forward really it's the addition of new programs and so we also took the cost of the program up to your point Lauren along with the savings expectation. So as I said in my prepared remarks, the momentum that Leading Beauty Forward has had over the three years that we've been managing the program has been quite strong. And as we look across our business and identify areas of further opportunity for transformation that is really what has driven that success. Everything from digitizing our creative process with some initiatives to the ones that I called out in the prepared remarks like indirect procurement, shared services, etc. So that's really what has driven the upside surprise. In terms of future programs again, we still haven't reached the full potential of Leading Beauty Forward from a savings standpoint. Next year will be a big year for completion of a lot of programs and then with the tail being in 2021. And so we'll see even greater savings that we will realize from the program through those efforts. Fabrizio Freda : And I just would like to add the point that you said on advertising is where are we leveraging the cost, why we are spending more in advertising. First of all our selling line is going down. Our selling line is going down because we are doing some good work of rationalization. And also because our channel mix require less selling line spending and more advertising spending today. That was in the past. So that's been a big but a Leading Beauty Forward supported this work in a very big way. Second, in the past our organization which is so focused on managing by brand which is the right thing to do forever because brands have to be authentic and distinctive. However in the past we have duplication in the back office cost that were not needed. So we need to manage by brand front not necessarily the back -- and moving forward in rationalizing the back office cost and limiting or avoiding duplications.  The third bucket is advertised as I said the rate of return of our advertising given our ability to focus more on growth channel, etc. has increased and we spend a lot in AMP and the rate of return in AMP has improved. And finally innovation, you have seen the great innovation and the returns we are having in innovation but our spending innovation is not increasing at the same pace of our success innovation. So our ability to use that, we have invested in creating the right data. I think our ability to focus innovation is to create a better rate of return of our innovation investment. At the end our company is really focused on delivering quality products to get high repeat rates. And I come back to the last point which is our repeat rates are increasing. And when repeat rates of quality product are increasing it is a great, great element of value creation over the long term and allow us to invest wherever we believe is appropriate to sustain future growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and also congrats on a strong quarter. So I wanted to go back to your China business and I just want to get a sense of what you guys are currently seeing on the ground in China and whether with all these headlines and some of the geopolitical concerns you are seeing and more volatility in your business in China I mean related to that, just curious if you guys have been at all surprised by the continued resilience of the China business? Fabrizio Freda : So the short answer is no, we are not seeing any slowdown in China at this point in time. And in the fourth quarter China as we commented in our prepared remarks was very, very strong. And I'm not surprised. I mean as I have been saying a lot and I believe we explained in detail in Investor Day, the fundamental for long-term sustainable growth with Chinese consumer are absolutely there and they are super strong. The middle class, the demographic, the fact that the young consumers in China spend more than the older one. The huge opportunity we have in front of us on tier 2 and 3 cities which is completely untapped. Actually I should say tier 3 and 4 cities which is completely untapped. At least numerically for luxury goods. The fact that the system we added 121 seating and thanks to our online operations and TMall sales to 650 cities this dynamic make China access consumers even when the productivity of that specific city is not ready. In fact the productivity of our stores in China is the best in the world. And as you know a lot of our profitability has to do with same door productivity and with single door productivities.  So all of these dynamics are here to stay and then our market share is improving. Just to be clear importantly we gained 80 points of share with significant increases of market share of Mac, La Mer, Tom Ford in China in the last year. So it is clearly a very well oiled system. Now the question of the moderation beyond the point that there is now a higher base and we need to reflect reality on that, the question of the issue is more about the questions out there in terms of the economic situation in China, in terms of the trade sanctions and the impact that trade sanctions could have on consumption in China. So there are economical and geopolitical reasons why we expect the moderation and also because we believe that now the base of growth is super strong. And we need to be realistic about the future. But as Tracey already said we are completely convinced that there are the fundamentals for double-digit growth in China with Chinese consumers for the sustainable future. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bonnie Herzog : Alright, thank you, good morning. I just had a quick question for Tracey on capital allocation. Just looking at some of your metrics it really does seem like you're in an optimal position here to either continue to step up shareholder returns or maybe execute on M&A. So, curious as to which you potentially see as most attractive today given what you're seeing out there on the acquisition front? Thanks. Tracey Travis : Yeah, I know Bonnie, thank you. So in terms of capital allocation yes, I mean it's a decision that we take along with our board every year in terms of the best uses of our very strong cash generation. Last year obviously we made the decision that we would step up share repurchase because that was the best return and certainly has proven to be the case for us. We did take a pause last year as it related to new acquisitions. A) I would say the valuations had gotten a bit lofty and B) you know our strategy on acquisitions we don't need acquisitions to grow. You know I did say in my prepared remarks that we would expect one point of growth to come from acquisitions over a three year time horizon. But the organic strength of our business is such that that certainly it also has a tremendous amount of momentum. So we have the benefit of looking for acquisitions that are strategic to our portfolio. We look for whitespace opportunities as it relates to acquisitions. I mean acquisitions that obviously we can get the right return on investment on. But, again the cash generation if there isn't an acquisition that's out there certainly we relook at our cash distributions across dividends and share repurchase activity and make a decision accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Steve Powers : Hey, great, thanks, good morning. First let me just a bit of housekeeping and follow-up to I think Lauren's question. Leading Beauty Forward charges came in I think 65 million to 80 million higher for the year than what you had guided at the end of the third quarter. So, apologies if I missed it but just if you could highlight some of the drivers there that would be great? My real question is on your biggest brands and what you expect from them in 2020, maybe just a little bit more of a health check, I guess from my perspective Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, even Mac seemed broadly healthy on a global basis but I love a little bit more from you on how you're viewing them in any pockets of higher opportunity that you see? And then Clinique which sounded like a point of relative optimism at your Investor Day back in March, it just still seems a little bit softer so I'd love to get your views there as well and how you think the contribution of Clinique will compare in 2020 to the year just completed? Thanks. Tracey Travis : So starting with Leading Beauty Forward, as we came upon the end and the close of the program in terms of accepting new initiatives we did have a number of new initiatives in the fourth quarter that were added to the program. And again those initiatives are expecting to generate an acceptable return. We have return thresholds underneath the program. So some of those were in our retail area as it looked at -- as we looked at retail rationalization as well as some strengthening of our freestanding store operations. So, and there were others as well that were added at the end of the year. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, in terms of brands we spoke about our top four brands in the year. When I said that three out of four we're growing at 80% of sales represented by brands we're growing. Quarter four was actually an improvement so what we said to the Investor Day is actually happening in quarter four. In quarter four total four of our largest brands had grown in constant currency and two rose double-digits. In old order brands representing over 94% of sales grew in quarter four. So we are really on a roll on all of our brands portfolio. And as far as Clinique, I remain optimistic for the brand, for a stabilization and then growth in the future. But we are good. As we said Clinique is growing in steps and now the priority is skincare which is the base, the fundamental also in terms of profitability for the brand. So we are first building moisturizer, skincare, and then we will pass to the rest and continue to build a brand using the same dynamic we're using on the other brands.  Also keep in mind for Clinique, the Clinique is the most disposed of our brands to North America and North America is the softest market overall, particularly in makeup and emphatically makeup is one of the area that we have not yet turnaround for that reason. So it is all very specific, very much we are in line with our long-term goals and what's happening. Then we have extraordinary brands also in the mid group for example Tom Ford or Jo Malone had a terrific year, having a terrific performance. I personally believe there will be soon very top big brands in our company so meaning that we will go from middle to big in the next year. And even in our small brands and new brands there are some highflyers. Take Le Labo, Le Labo is one of the really highflyers in our young brand portfolio. So we have an extraordinary brand portfolio and I think we have learned how to continue building it, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is on fire as I said in my prepared remarks and we expect that the strengths of our brands will continue to operate in fiscal year 2020 and in fiscal year 2020 we expect some improvements in the areas which are still to be improved as Tracey said. And namely is Clinique U.S. and Mac U.S. the two that we are focused on looking for improvements. But the rest is frankly on fire. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Erinn Murphy : Great, thank you, good morning. I guess my question was around TMall, could you just maybe reflect on what you think made Tom Ford's launch so successful on that platform and then with less than 50% of your portfolio on TMall any rollout plans in 2020 for other brands within your portfolio and how you think about it longer-term? And then just sorry Tracey one follow-up, I may have missed this, in the U.S. can you talk about what you saw specifically with specialty multi? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Start, so now TMall is an exceptional partner and we are having very good business with them. The strengths of TMall is that we control our business and the ability to deliver the right equity for the brands in intercommunication. The Tom Ford launch had an enormous amount of super outstanding quality creative assets produced for the launch of TMall that created a lot of traffic and a lot of conversion from visitor to purchaser. And that's what was driving the success, the creative aspects that were done by the Tom Ford team together with the China team and obviously under the direction of Tom Ford personally who is an amazing creative leader. This combination was very exciting for the Chinese consumers. And so the result was high traffic, high conversion, and that's what drove that success. So we are seeing more of this. I think we have learned together with our TMall partners how to create the right level of traffic interest conversion on TMall platform also for the future. And to your question of do we plan to launch more brands, yes, in the future we will launch more brands. It depends also from the brands that we will launch in China in the future to continue building our Chinese portfolio. Tracey Travis : And regarding specialty multi Erinn, in the quarter in North America specialty multi was up about 1%. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Congrats on a strong year and thanks for squeezing me in. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning, thank you. Jason English : You're welcome. Two quick questions, first building off the question on TMall, given the control you have there out of curiosity, do you record the sales there at retail sales price or wholesale and if it's different then, if it is retail is there a mixed benefit you're seeing? And then second question is really on holistically looking at the margin profile for next year, at the midpoint it looks like you're guiding to roughly 70 basis points or so of EBIT margin expansion based on my back of the envelope math, not far off of I think the underlying 90 that you achieve this year but you're getting less productivity savings as a percentage of sales and you're expecting less leverage from the incremental sales, the four points Tracey that you highlighted suggesting there's some other offsets there that are helping you deliver that robust growth, can you give us some more context and quantification around those? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : I'll start from your first question while Tracey will answer the second. So we recorded retail sales of TMall and in my prepared remarks I spoke about our direct to consumer business. Our direct to consumer business is all retail for us and our direct to consumer business is our freestanding stores, is our brand.com like est\u00e9elauder.com and TMall and other platforms, other TMall where we are in control. And that part of the business is growing and that part of the business I want to repeat that had 1.3 billion visitors in the year. So imagine the amount of data that we have, the amount of equity building communication that we can do, and the impact. And a positive impact of all of this on in general what the consumer decide to buy even in other channels and in other situation in the course of the year. So it is a very powerful dynamic that helps also our wholesale business. Tracey Travis : And as it relates to the productivity savings and the margin expansion you're spot on Jason, not surprisingly in terms of what we are initially expecting for margin expansion in fiscal 2020. Again having top line sales growth of 7% to 8% versus 12% we are seeing less leverage based on sales but still some. Some related to obviously our continuing cost savings and the ramping up more of Leading Beauty Forward savings along with other cost programs. And then a little bit of mix benefit as well in order to drive that 70 basis points. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 PM Eastern Time today through September 2nd. To hear a recording of the call please dial 855-859-2056. Passcode 9999544.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Rainey Mancini : Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and other reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we will ask that you please limit to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey, and good morning, everyone. We have started off our new fiscal year with terrific results. Our successful strategy driven by the multiple engines of growth helped us to deliver an extraordinary performance, especially in light of the volatile macro environment. Net sales grew 12% in constant currency making our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As a result, we gained share and strengthened our leading position in global prestige beauty. We leveraged our strong sales increase with a disciplined focus on cost and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 20%. Our performance on both the top and the bottom lines was fueled by successful innovations, increased advertising and effective marketing across brands, categories, geographies and channels. With deeper consumer insights informed by improved data analytics, we expanded our growth engines activated additional ones and invested in the best opportunities worldwide, which fueled these strong results. We remain mindful of global volatility risk. However, with the strong start and our confidence in continue to execute effectively, we are raising our net sales and EPS estimates for the year in constant currency. During the quarter, the external environment was challenging and we faced different issues in every region. Disruptions in Hong Kong affected commerce in that area. Continued uncertainty about Brexit impacted consumer spending in the UK and demand for makeup in North America softened. However, by having numerous growth engines across all facets of our business, we were able to deliver and exceed our sales and earnings expectations. Most of the over-achievement came from continued strengths in China and Travel Retail. We also had better-than-expected improvements across Europe and our other emerging markets. Also, contributed to our continued growth is our company positions in the sweet spot of consumer goods. Our brands generate superior consumer loyalty, evident in our strong repurchase rates. And while our high quality products justify premium pricing, they are an affordable luxury, which we believe, makes them more resilient to economic volatility than other luxury products. During the quarter, each of our four largest brands grew globally, reflecting strong consumer demand for established brands and their proven desirable product and compelling innovations. Estee Lauder and La Mer each advanced more than 20%. A key strategy is our focus on hero franchises which are the high repeat products in each brand. With greater innovation and resources around these hero product lines; our brands successfully attracted new consumers and reinforced their loyalty with existing ones. Our Estee Lauder brand is a great example of this winning strategy. The brand introduced a new product in its largest franchise Advanced Night Repair. Sales of the concentrate exceeded our expectations, and it helped lift the entire franchise by double-digits globally. In Asia, buzz around Estee Lauder new Intense Reset Concentrate broadened the brand reach about 70% of consumers who bought it were new to the brand, underscoring our strategic priority to attract new users with exciting innovations. Estee Lauder was one of several of our brands that benefited from rapid growth in the skincare category worldwide. We are well-positioned to meet the growing demand for all types of skincare products. It is our largest category and grew sharply accounting for nearly half of our global sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in skincare. La Mer gained share in luxury skin care in Asia Pacific and Clinique delivered a stronger global growth in several years driven by well received skin care innovations. One of Clinique's newest products, the Smart Clinical multidimensional moisturizer line resonated strongly with ageless consumers, particularly in North America and the UK. In other developments, our Tom Ford Beauty brand launched a luxury skincare collection to complement its successful fragrance and makeup offerings. Our makeup sales grew globally driven by a sharp uptick in Asia Pacific and Travel Retail as well as gains in the European region. The deceleration in prestige color cosmetics has been driven by Anglo market, but growth is still healthy in other geographies. And global companies like ours are well-positioned to grow in the category. Using enhanced data analytics and consumer insight that signal new and fast growing areas of demand, we invest in the promising subcategories as they emerge. For example, we knew the interest in foundations with skincare benefits was trending. With that insight, we develop new products around our hero foundations they offer hydrating and smoothing benefits. In our foundation business climbed 20% globally. We innovated with great success in other subcategories where we found granular opportunities. For example, MAC introduced Love Me lipstick, a breakthrough weightless and motorizing formula that offers lasting color. The product helped increase the brand lip business which climbed double-digits. Overall, our innovation was robust and new products accounting for 30% of our makeup category this quarter. Turning to our geographies. Our growth in China accelerated from the previous quarter, fueled by multiple engines. We had double-digit growth across all categories, all channels and nearly all brands. Our online business in China was strong. Our sales on Tmall doubled with growth across brands. We also successfully partnered with Tmall on special events, such as Jo Malone London Super Brand Day. Additionally, GLAMGLOW launched on the platform in September. Investing in emerging markets remains a strategic priority because we anticipate a continuation of growing demand for prestige beauty from the expanding middle class. Excluding China, as a group, this market rose double digits and they recruited several new consumers. Standout included Russia, Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia and we saw improvements in retail in Middle East. Our business in Hong Kong was challenged. Our sales declined 20% in the quarter and we have not seen sign of improvement to-date. However, since the last downturn in the market, we have re-positioned our business and increased sales with local consumers becoming less dependent on tourists, which was the most affected area. Our sales decline in Hong Kong was offset by an acceleration in the rest of Asia, reflecting strong consumer demand for our prestige brands and desirable products. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, every market grew, which added another growth driver and broadened our multiple engines. We were encouraged by strengths in the large Western European markets which advanced as well as many emerging markets in the region. Thanks in part to strong reception of our brand's innovation across categories. The North America market remained challenged by declining makeup sales, mainly in color cosmetics, as well as weak traffic in brick and mortar department store where we are the largest player. Although, our business generally reflected these trends, there were several bright spots. Our skincare business rose, several brands had higher sales and we had grown in key subcategories such as eye treatments or mascara. Typically, skincare makeup growth fluctuates depending on trends and innovation and can accelerate at different rates at different times. However, on average, over the last five years, both categories rose nearly 10% compounded annually in the US. We believe recent declines in color cosmetics in the US are due to several factors. Trends change and a more natural appearance is now involved, which requires fewer products that went contouring and other looks were popular. Also, the number of new product launches in makeup declined 20% in the last year, including forming the brands. In addition, Gen Z consumers are discovering the benefits of skin care, spurred by more social media activity in that category. Our brands continue to innovate strongly in both makeup and skincare. Clinique recently launched a new lipstick collection, which matches the consumer foundation shape with 28 new lipstick color based on the brand shade Match Science. This continues Clinique customization of beauty product that began with its successful Clinique at the skincare launch. Looking at our business by channel. Travel Retail and online globally again drove our performance. Travel Retail upward trajectory continued with strong double-digit sales growth, reflecting diversified growth engines across brands worldwide. Our products continue to resonate globally and like-door growth was robust. Among our top eight brands in the channel, all but one grew double-digits at retail. Digital campaigns and pre-ordering aimed at travelers before they start their trip helped boost sales. We expanded distribution for our newer artisanal fragrance brands and there is still much distribution expansion remaining for many brands in our portfolio that are only available in a small percentage of airports. Our online business also climbed strong double-digits. All types of online distribution grew substantially led by third-party sites and retailer sites. Traffic was higher and mobile commerce accounted for more than half of our e-commerce sales. We increased our advertising investment faster than our sales growth and continued to focus our spending on digital advertising, which accounted for 75% of the total. Our digital spending is mainly on advertising social media communications and search engines. Our brands are using many digital tools and experimenting with emerging social media platform to connect with consumers. For example, MAC launched a tool that lets consumer test over 100 lipstick shades on their own face by accessing the camera of their own phone and to simply research and purchasing. La Mer and Bobbi Brown launched voice search on their brand dot com sites in North America. We are proud of our results this quarter and confident we have the right plans in place for the rest of the year. Our brands have created many exciting products and promotions for the holiday period, in store and online for Cyber Monday and 11/11 in Asia and we believe consumers will be attracted by our compelling offerings. Looking ahead, we expect to further expand and magnify our multiple engine of growth across categories, brands, channels and geographies to better manage global volatility. We will continue to leverage our superb skincare growth and expect to gain even greater market share in that category. We have the best diversified pure-play in global prestige beauty with talented global teams and have profound local expertise, which makes us well positioned to pursue the fastest-growing areas around the world for any kind of consumer. At the same time, we will continue to transform our business as we anticipate what lies ahead and strengthen our entrepreneurial and competitive spirits. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning everyone. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. And now for the quarter results. Net sales for the first quarter rose 12% driven by strong growth in our international regions and in our skincare category. Asia, Travel Retail and online continued to deliver strong growth and our European and Latin America market sales growth accelerated, while sales in North America remain challenged. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region net sales rose 26%, with more than half of the markets contributing double-digit increases. Sales in Greater China rose strong double-digits. Our sales in Mainland China continued to deliver broad-based growth across cities, brands, categories and channels as we gained share and as anticipated, our sales in Hong Kong fell 20%. Among developed markets in APAC, both Japan and Korea delivered double-digit sales growth this quarter. Our sales in Japan which grew a solid 7% last fiscal year, accelerated even further within the quarter in anticipation of an October 1st VAT increase the country. In Korea, sales in specialty-multi and online distribution were robust. And we gained share in department stores. Southeast Asia grew double-digits led by Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 19%, with every market contributing to growth. Our Global Travel retail business rose strong double-digits led by quarters across Asia. Strong like-door growth drove the majority of the increase in Travel Retail, and was supplemented by the rapid development of online pre-ordering. Our emerging markets in the region grew high-single digits, led by a double-digit increase in Russia and the Middle East. Western markets grew mid-single digits, led by Switzerland and Greece. Our sales in the UK grew modestly this quarter despite continued challenges in brick and mortar retail. Some retailers bought extra stock this quarter ahead of the anticipated hard Brexit and our online business in the UK continued to grow double-digits. Net sales in the Americas, declined 6%. Brick and mortar retail remained difficult especially in department stores. As you know, the makeup category in North America has been declining and we are the leading prestige company in the category. We continue to invest where we saw the best opportunities for growth. Skincare showed good growth driven by Estee Lauder, Clinique and La Mer, in their hero franchises. Within makeup, we saw solid growth with some key subcategories such as mascara. And while our fragrance business was particularly soft this quarter, it is expected to pick up in the holiday quarter. Looking at the region by channel, North America sales rose in both brand and retailer online as well as in freestanding retail stores. Our sales in the specialty-multi channel also grew at retail. Our Estee Lauder brand and most luxury brands grew in North America this quarter. In addition, sales in Latin America grew double-digits in all major markets. From a category standpoint, skincare led growth this quarter. Net sales accelerated to 25% with strong contributions from Estee Lauder, La Mer and Clinique. Innovations such as Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intense, Reset Concentrate, LA Mer the Regenerating Serum and Clinique's Smart-Clinical multi-dimensional line, contributed incremental sales and supported hero franchises. And the historical strength of Origins and natural skincare helped drive the brand's double-digit gains. Net sales in makeup grew 4%, with strong double-digit growth in Asia and Travel Retail led by strong innovations and support behind foundation and lip products from Estee Lauder, MAC, Lamar and Tom Ford Beauty. Sales of fragrances declined 1% as sales in luxury and artisanal brands were offset by declines in designer fragrances. Clinique and Estee Lauder which had a tough comparison to the prior year launch of Beautiful Belle. Innovations this quarter included Poppy & Barley from Jo Malone, METALLIQUE from Tom Ford and new City Exclusives from Le Labo. Fragrance sales grew in all international regions, but were soft in the Americas region as I mentioned earlier. Our hair care sales declined 4% driven by a tough comparison to the prior year launch of Cherry Almond shampoo and conditioner from Aveda, as well as lower sales from Bumble and bumble in North America. Our gross margin declined 10 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Higher obsolescence and sourcing costs were mostly offset by pricing and favorable skincare category mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 120 basis points. Continued leverage of our cost base due to greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs more than covered higher advertising investments to build awareness in critical growth markets and support our innovations globally. Operating income rose 17% and operating margin increased by 110 basis points. Diluted EPS of $1.67 increased 19% compared to the prior year and grew 20% in constant currency. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth with greater operating leverage and a slightly favorable tax rate. During the quarter, we utilized $170 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year, due primarily to timing differences in accounts payable and we invested $125 million in capital expenditures. We used $313 million to repurchase 1.6 million shares of our stock and paid $156 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. Now, let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. We are pleased obviously with the strong start to our fiscal year, but we recognize that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions, Brexit and continued challenges in Hong Kong's retail environment could impact our fiscal 2020 results. Nonetheless, we believe our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to deliver strong global results. For the year, we are raising our sales growth expectation by one point to 8% to 9% in constant currency. This still assumes a moderation of growth in China in Travel Retail in the back half of the year. Despite the market conditions in place today, we expect our North America business to gradually improve fueled by innovations in skincare and foundations, better fragrance performance during holiday and strong growth online. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.09 for the euro, $1.23 for the pound and $7.12 for the won for the fiscal year. EPS is expected to range between $5.85 and $5.93 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from currency translation. As you are most likely aware, currency rates have moved about 3% to 4% since our last guidance, which was based on rates as of June 30th, the spot rate. The won, euro and pound have all weakened relative to the US dollar and created a currency swing of approximately $0.10 on our annual expectations for EPS. So the currency impact previously was a plus $0.05 that we were expecting for the year and we are now expecting a minus $0.05 EPS impact based on the September 30th spot rates. For the second quarter, net sales are expected to increase approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point. Therefore we expect reported net sales to grow between 7% and 8%. EPS is forecast between $1.83 and $1.86 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.02 dilution from currency. With a strong start to the fiscal year, we are optimistic about our ability to execute our plans to deliver another year of top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit EPS improvement. And with that, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask a little bit about US and distribution footprint because the commentary we all know of course that the specialty-multi channel has slowed a bit. And Tracey, your comment I think was pretty specific that you still saw growth in the channel at retail. So I guess one, can you talk about any inventory destocking that might be going on in that channel? And two, what might be happening there in terms of foot traffic and takeaway because that might tell a slightly better story in terms of the health of the channel versus, I think what we're all worried about in terms of maybe like a structural slowdown of the channel? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Let me start answering this question. I think the key point is I don't think stocks -- the key point here is that the color makeup market has softened. And there are certain companies like us and certain retailers which are more exposed to makeup than others. And this has fluctuations. And so in that quarter, that was the new news that we have managed around. And so the key idea is that when we see trends, we are able to anticipate and react to those trends. That's why we moderated the impact of this fluctuation on makeup, pushing more obviously our skincare business and continue building our distribution in the way that we want to focus it in the long term, meaning swinging the distribution toward high traffic, high performance channels and retailers gradually over time. So, the strategy continues. On top in North America, we have really improved our team, our capabilities, our ability to manage the market granularly exactly to anticipate and react to these trends very fast. We have better consumer insights; more local relevance and we have dramatically improved the ability to work online and our online business have been very solid. So, we are committed to improve the North America trends in the course of this fiscal year obviously even more in the long term. And this quarter was mainly, as I explained, a softer than expected color makeup business. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, that's great. Thank you. In that regard Fabrizio you're pointing out some of the changes that you've already started to make in the US and that you had actually talked about and I think some of the things that Chris Good highlighted at your Analyst Day in the spring were really interesting, so it was a type of [ph] segmentation. So when do we start to see or do you think we start to see that impact performance? Is that kind of why you're speaking to the forecasted improvement from here? It's less about the makeup category and getting healthier and more about some of Estee Lauder specific proactive hyper-segmentation coming into play? Is that fair? Fabrizio Freda : Yes, that's fair. It is going to be more proactive segmentation. Also it's going to be innovation focused on this proactive segmentation. That's why in my prepared remark I explained that our innovation, for example, the Clinique innovation on makeup is more customized exactly to the opportunity we had identified. I also explained that frankly, when you don't look to the last quarter or the last six months, but you look to the last five years, the categories, makeup, skin care or even the subcategories like color cosmetic versus the foundation or moisturizer versus anti-aging had different situation and different trends. On average over the years, this category all been growing pretty well. In this moment, there is a softness in color makeup for a specific consumer-driven reason. I personally believe this will come back. It has always come back up and down over time. Tracey Travis : I would also add more in that. We did have an unusual anniversarying of a very strong launch period last quarter from a fragrance standpoint last year with Estee Lauder Beautiful Belle and some of our other designer fragrances, and we are comfortable and quite encouraged by our holiday programs for the second quarter. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And also, I want to clarify because maybe this is not completely coming out from the fragrance number that our high-end fragrances so Jo Malone, Tom Ford continues to grow very strongly also in North America -- globally and in North America. So the fragrance number is 100% influenced by the base period of the launch of Estee Lauder in the past and scent designer fragrance performance, but our high-end fragrances continue to be strong performance, continue to become a bigger percentage of our business and we are at the moment of tilting the proportion. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on and try to get back in. Operator : The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So I wanted to flush out a bit more the lower global prestige beauty category revenue growth guidance you gave in your release versus last quarter. Can you give us a sense of which geographies and product categories are driving that lower growth expectation? Is it just mainly US makeup or are there other areas and then obviously you raised your own internal sales forecasts? So just help us understand the context of greater confidence in Estee market share trends within that lower prestige category growth? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. First of all, I want to say our estimate of the market is still very, very strong and the 5% to 6% is at the top of the historical averages. So to be clear, we continue to believe that this -- the prestige beauty is going to be one of the fastest growing market in consumer goods and that will continue to be in this moment on top of the historical averages. So, this is a great moment of growth overall. We have taken this point down in reflecting the reality of the softening of the color makeup, particularly in the Anglo market, specifically North America, UK, Australia and to reflect our assumption to a moderation of growth, in China and Travel Retail that however, to be clear, we have not yet seen happening, but just to be consistent with our future forecast and that's what we're seeing, but again, this is the most robust consumer market in the numbers and this robustness will continue in our estimate. Tracey Travis : And obviously taking up the year certainly reflects there the performance that we saw in the first quarter. Dara Mohsenian : Great, thanks. Operator : The next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Just sort of following up a little bit on that. Can you talk about your expectation for market share gains, particularly given that a key competitor's luxury division at least this quarter outpaced your growth? Now clearly Asia continues to be fantastic. Is there more coming there to drive even greater improvement, more in terms of the US rebound? You talked a little bit about that in the prepared remarks, even more doors, even better innovation? And maybe if you could just sort of, if possible, on the category growth, just sort of talk through the prestige growth where it's more --where your expectation is going in makeup? Thanks. Tracey Travis : So I'll start and then Fabrizio will continue. So, Olivia, we're seeing strong growth in Asia. We're seeing very strong growth, as we've called out previously in Travel Retail. We're seeing also an acceleration in EMEA as well. So some of the things that give us confidence in terms of gaining market share, it's less about North America at the moment, although we clearly expect to see, as I said in my prepared remarks, modest improvements in North America throughout the course of the year, but from a share standpoint, we really expect to gain share outside of North America in our international markets as well as good growth in online as well. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And on top of what Tracey explained, obviously is the strength of this quarter -- the strengths of the last two years show that we are growing clearly ahead of market. So we are gaining market share. So it's not that we plan to do anything different. We continue to gain market share in a very good way, we are growing market share today. Our strategy for growing market share is not to spend aggressively in stable markets to fight market share in a zero-sum gain. Our strategy to grow market share is dictated by our Compass, where we anticipate where growth will come from and we build market share at the beginning of the growth trend. For example, in this moment, we are gaining significant market share in China. We are gaining significant market share in every single of the emerging markets of the world. We are gaining, again, market share in Europe, in Western Europe. We are gaining market share in most of the categories in the UK because of the softness on the market. And so we grow market share where we are taking the opportunity to really anticipate growth in areas that then in the future will increase dramatically so that our market share is also a reflection of mix where our high market share markets will become over time bigger and grow our global market share. So it's a very long-term-oriented game. And because of this, it's very efficient and our rate of return on the investment of our market share growth are excellent and I monitor it every day. The other big driver of market share growth is innovation. As we said, we had a robust innovation, a very, very good results in the success of our innovation. In the last years, we have improved it dramatically. Our speed of our innovation is improving; in this moment, we had about 70% of the innovation that we had developed from idea to market in 12 months and many other particularly makeup within six months. This was not possible in the past and this has reinforced our ability to grow market share via innovation in every market of the world. And then finally, our Leading Beauty Forward activities have created more flexibility for us to invest in advertising and advertising invested in the current way is the other increasing tool and increasing strength for us to grow market share globally. Operator : The next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj : Thanks. Fabrizio, that's a very good segue to my question actually and recognizing very much the share gains that you've developed and growing the beauty category even as it slows the gap in fact as to your point continue to expand as you continue to outgrow even further the category. And I guess my question is what levers do you have at your disposal if the top line of the category slows even more. What levers do you have at your disposal to keep growing top line, keep growing margins if it really gets tougher from here, would you just continue to invest more in advertising and innovation like you just described, would you acquire more, would you lever the balance sheet more and buy back stock more? Are there new expansion and geographies that you take advantage of? Could you cut costs a lot further? I guess I'm trying to get a better sense of what's the contingency plan if the world gets much tougher from here? Fabrizio Freda : The contingency plan is the diversification of our business in the sense that we believe that the total beauty business globally will continue to grow healthy, as I just explained in the previous question. So we can argue, if this 5% to 6% or 6% to 7%, but those are the recent numbers. And this is sustainable in the long term as we have explained in our Analyst Day. So that being the base, however as we have demonstrated in this moment, that could be in a given market, a given category which is softer in this moment is color makeup in the United States as an example. And then what we do is that we are able to continue to try to improve in this category and using the softness also to build some market share. But most importantly, we are going to diversify our investment, our innovation, our marketing activation, our consumer repeat purchase activations and CRMs on where there is growth. And today we have the agility to move investment from maybe temporarily soft markets or categories to very, very high growth market and categories. This agility has improved, thanks to the increase of variable cost and reduction of fixed costs that Leading Beauty Forward provide and our flexibility to invest in advertising when needed. So, basically the answer -- the overall strategic answer to your question, the flexibility that we have is part of our multiple engine or growth strategy and the ability to continuously invest on where there is growth, where the return of our investment will be the highest not only financially, but also in term of growth in market share. Then going more in specific of the flexibility, we have taken this quarter -- I think this quarter, you can read it in many different ways, but for us it's a terrific demonstration of our multiple engine of growth. We are delivering a 12% growth globally and despite color makeup had one of the softer trends in Anglo markets in the last years, Hong Kong has been difficult, and North America business in total had a softer market than expected. Why? Because we have accelerated angry [ph] market share and deployed innovation in skincare in a terrific way across the globe in every single market because this quarter, 94% of our brands grew, basically all our portfolio is growing because Asia has further accelerated. China has further accelerated. TR has been super strong. Online continue to grow at the same strong level that's been growing for some years. In every single online channel, one data point which is interesting, our direct-to-consumer part of online, meaning where we have direct-to-consumer which include our brand dot com and Tmall, has been growing at 40%-plus. So we continue achieving more direct content with the consumers via that. And we have been able, despite this area of softness, to focus also on the area of strengths, adding total to beat our growth forecast. That I think is the key sign that we are trying to explain is the secret is not never having something in the world that doesn't work. With such a big category, something will go wrong somewhere, but now we have the flexibility to move in order to always try our best to deliver the total and progress the total in term of growth, EPS and market share. Operator : The next question is from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. I'd like to drill down a little bit more into China and specifically a number of things. First, you noted that China had accelerated. Was that your business and your market share or was it the market as a whole? Second, as you've looked at and related -- as you've looked at the Chinese market over the last 12 months, have there been any changes that you've seen or any adjustments that you've done to give us a little bit better sense of what's going on in the ground? And then finally, our read of the media that's coming out of China, is that the pre-sales for 11/11 are off to a record start. I mean, really phenomenal pre-sales. Is that correct and has that continued? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So let's start to the core of your question. China market continued to grow, the beauty market above 20%. So the market is super solid. We grew much more than that and we built significant market share. In the quarter, we built almost 2 full points of market share, so significant market share in the market. And so both the market and our market share gains are working together in that sense. What is driving that? First of all, we are in China for the long term. We have a local organization which is terrific and understand the local relevance of the market. We are able to invest in all the area of growth. In this moment in China, there is a lot of growth that is coming also not only for Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, which has been true for some time, but Tier 3 sorry and Tier 4 city are accelerating significantly, which is what is reflected in the acceleration of Tmall that you are referring to. Let me explain what the dynamic here. Historically in China, there was no national advertising. We could invest where we had distribution. So if you had stores in Shanghai, you could invest in print in Shanghai. With the advent of social media, social media is national. And because of this, there is the possibility of creating demand nationally even if distribution for the moment is -- our most distributed brand is in totally 121 cities, while in reality, there is social media impact and demand created in over 600 cities. So there are hundreds of cities with million inhabitants with growing middle class that for the moment do not have access to physical distribution. And obviously, the two drivers of their consumption is TR and Tmall and online brand.com site like ours. So obviously, over time, distribution will increase and physical distribution will make more inroads into these cities. But for the time being, online is basically the way in which demand gets satisfied. And with that dynamic is a long-term dynamic and will continue for some time independently from temporary or not softness or economic variations. But this long-term is driven by middle class demographics and by the passion for beauty of the Chinese population, and frankly, for the Asian population as a whole. So this is the trend and I believe that our position is strong and the forecast for the market in the long term remains as strong as possible. Operator : The next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, two questions if I can. First, on the balance sheet. Your cash balance just continues to grow on -- and I assume you're in the market or will be soon supporting the stock and buying back more. But just generally, you're kind of -- it seems like you're sort of -- there's an aversion to acquisitions these days. But can you talk about, sort of, your interest in doing something more aggressive on the repurchase side? What's your philosophy with that growing cash balance? And then just secondly, can you remind us -- the gross margin has been under pressure now for several years and it just continues to surprise me because skincare I thought was your highest gross margin business. And with that outsized growth, I would have thought gross margin would revert to going back up at some point. So that -- a little bit of color there would be great too. Thanks. Tracey Travis : Okay. So let me start with your second question, Wendy. In terms of the gross margin, there are many factors that impact gross margin, obviously. And clearly, skincare is a benefit from a gross margin standpoint. Certain channels are a benefit from a gross margin standpoint as well. As we've called out, we have given where growth is coming from for us, a lot in Asian markets and you're aware of our footprint. We do have more supply chain expenses related to supporting some of the terrific double-digit growth that we've had and certainly that growth being in the Eastern part of the world has increased both inventory levels as well as transit costs. The tariffs, we've also spoken about the fact that we do have and have included some of the higher tariffs that have been called out in our gross margin as well. So we are seeing some shifts upside related to category mix and some geographic mix, offset by some of those other factors related to freight as well as obsolescence and some of the supply chain costs related to tariffs, etcetera. In terms of the balance sheet, our general philosophy as it relates to free cash flow is to return free cash flow to shareholders if in fact, we don't have any acquisitions that we are contemplating. We are always in the market looking for the right strategic acquisitions that will represent white space opportunity for us and incremental sales and profit growth. We also have minority investments that we have a path to purchase as well. So, we definitely consider acquisitions as an important strategic growth opportunity for us, the right acquisitions that again represent a good fit within our portfolio. If we have no acquisitions that are at the right price and represent those white space opportunities, then generally -- and we have this discussion every year with our board, we return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase activity. And you're aware as well, we have also increased our CapEx this year to reinvest back in the business again to support long-term growth. So I think our capital deployment in terms of the cash, even though you're seeing a little bit extra on the balance sheet is, in the highest return areas in terms of how we strategically allocate it for our purposes as well as for shareholder purposes. Operator : The next question is from Mark [ph] with Stifel. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks and good morning, everybody. A couple of clarifications, please. So the VAT benefit in Japan, how much was the benefit, was it material in the quarter, is there any expectations that that comes out of the December quarter? And then your category growth expectation, I was under the impression that you had anticipated a moderation at some point in time in China when you gave it originally. And so your comment in addition to North America weakness was I guess somewhat surprising or maybe I misinterpreted it. So, maybe if you could talk about kind of the confluence of those expecting China to already decelerate and yet taking your global growth rate down. And kind of related to the last one, how do you think about North America over the balance of the year? You had talked about it, anticipated to stabilize; is that still the expectation and what does stabilize kind of mean? Tracey Travis : Okay, let me start. I'll start with your question on Japan. So as I'm sure you're aware, the Japan market had a VAT increase starting on October 1st. So typically -- and we have this experience from the last time, there was a VAT increase in the market. We do see some acceleration of purchases into the month prior to the increase, which is expected. It typically normalizes out during the course of the year. So the reason I commented on the fact that we're coming off of a 7% growth last year from Japan, we certainly expect Japan for the year will normalize out to the levels of very strong growth that we've seen and we're very pleased with the pickup that we've seen in Japan over the last couple of years, really a testament to the great team that we have in Japan and what they've been doing in the market. As it relates to North America, we did say and I did say in my prepared remarks, we expect gradual improvement. We did talk about the fact that we have seen further deceleration in North America. Fabrizio talked about the color makeup challenges that we, along with others, have spoken about in the market. So depending on your definition of stabilization, we certainly expect to see improvement from the results that we saw in the first quarter. And again, we had some unusual anniversarying items in the first quarter as well, but -- so we expect to see gradual improvement from the first quarter results throughout the balance of the year for North America. Fabrizio Freda : And I think the other part you referred to China. We said, no, our market point of view is that 5% to 6% growth is a super strong growth that will continue at the high end as explained of the historical range, but we have reflected the softening of the makeup North America market in our global estimate. And then we continue to assume that there could be a softening of the China market in the future, but as I said, we have not seen it yet. I just commented that actually we see an acceleration in this moment, but we believe this is a prudent assumption in the current global economic situation. Operator : The next question is from Fulvio [ph] with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just on that last comment you made Fabrizio about the potential of a slowdown in China. I mean given the comments that you've also made during this call about the contingencies, the diversification of your business, the ability to quickly react and adapt and go after new pockets of growth. How should we then read that in reference to the guidance that you've given? Because I guess if you think about what you've delivered, what you expect to deliver in the second quarter, your full year guidance implies just over 5% organic growth in the second half. I'm just sort of trying to understand why you couldn't use all the tools that you've got available now to offset potentially some of that China slowdown if and when it comes in the second half to still generate a high level of growth? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So, I think -- this is Tracey and then Fabrizio will respond. In the second half, we're -- I think your numbers are a little soft. If you do the math, it's more in the 6% to 7% range in terms of what we're expecting in the second half of the year with the moderation that we spoke about in -- as it relates to China and Travel Retail. And again, given the global backdrop and the global environment, it has nothing to do with our business. It is really a point of view with respect to what could happen to global markets given the fact that there are global macro slowdowns, even though we haven't in fact seen it in China and haven't seen it affect our Asia business in general, which is quite strong, but it certainly could happen. And so as we plan our business, plan our resources in the second half of the year, clearly if it doesn't happen, then we'll continue to have the kind of results that we had in the first quarter, but we think it's responsible for us to expect what many economists are projecting in terms of a slowdown in the second half of the year. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And by the way, to go to your point, I've explained all our great strengths, strategic strengths, the flexibility, the agility, the ability to leverage all channel. That's why we believe that even if there was a slowdown, we will continue to build market share and we'll continue to be ahead of the market. That's the strengths we've built. And if there will be no slowdown, we will over-deliver and that's what happened this quarter. And it happened frankly even in case there was one element, that actually was worse than our expectation. There was the makeup color market in the US. So even in presence of one element, that was actually a surprise, we still over-deliver because all the other elements, first of all, the strategic execution that I commented on and second, the overall trend of the market in Asia is now slowdown and our strategy execution is excellent and so we have over-delivered. And that's the situation. In this moment, as you see also, currencies have impacted in a way which were different than our guidance just few months ago. So there're many variables that we are trying to take under account, but the strengths of our model and the ability to navigate good times and bad times, growing market share, doing better than market that I believe is by now really proven. Tracey Travis : Thank you for recognizing the fact that we are operating quite well in a very difficult market. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. Rainey Mancini : We do have time for one final question, that question will come from Linda Bolton with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Linda Bolton : So I was wondering if you could comment on this concept of your hero products, which drive your core franchises so successfully. I think in the past, you had commented that some of the indie brands in North America may be weren't so good at that. Have you detected any increased capability on their part to develop these hero products, which could be further threatening to your market share? Can you just comment on that? And also the idea that your costs to attract attention on first trial is rising over time, can you comment on that trend and whether there's been any change there? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, interesting question. So as I explained also in my prepared remark, what we define hero products in our portfolio is actually products with high repeat rates and a decent purchase frequency, meaning products that have not only the power to make the consumer loyal, but also they have to bring the consumer to the repurchase return that create traffic in stores for our partners and for ourselves. So these products are very precious in the portfolio and to build product like that, marketing is not enough. You need superior quality and great performance because I know many people, including myself, that is tempted to try new stuff one time to try new things, but I don't know any person that buys these things the second time if this product didn't perform in line with expectation and that's what we mean. We invest into high quality R&D, high quality manufacturing, safety, clinical test, product that really work and not only they work in term of performance and they have the kind of texture and usage experience that made the consumer delighted about what design and that investments that at the end is the essence of our premium pricing strategy. That investment creates repeat purchase. This is still a very big differentiator between on average our portfolio and the portfolio of indie brands. If you look at the numbers, the difference in repeat are still significant because also the difference of repeat are driven by quality, innovation and by the ability to delight the consumer over the long term. So we believe this is a strength which is not being mitigated. In your question, you speak about new threat. Frankly, on that topic, I don't see new threat. Actually, I see new strengths and it is from new strengths for our brands, not for the indie brands. And to prove that, is that this is the first quarter in some time where each one of our big brands is growing globally and the total of them is growing faster than any combination of our indie brands; and so it is really an extraordinary, if you want proof of the point, that repeat purchase is the biggest driver of prestige beauty.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Rainey Mancini : Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and other reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now, I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey, and good morning to everyone. We delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, which I will elaborate on shortly. But first I want to acknowledge how concerned we are for all the people including our employee and consumers who are affected by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China and around the world. Our hearts go out to them and I will discuss what steps our company is taking to support them in a few minutes. In the second quarter, our prestige beauty portfolio resonated with consumers globally. Our successful strategy based on multiple engines of growth once again helped fuel our performance as we grew in all regions and all major categories. Skin care rose in every region as did fragrance and hair care while makeup grew internationally. The company generated 16% constant currency sales growth, the highest organic growth rate in 20 years in the seasonally largest quarter of our fiscal year allowing us to gain significant share in global prestige beauty. While our second quarter continues to be boosted by holiday, it now also includes another important event driver Singles Day. Our advanced planning for these events delivered strong growth across our business led by Asia/Pacific region, the global online and travel retail channels and the skincare and fragrance categories powered by the extraordinary performance of Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands. With disciplined expense management, we leverage our sales growth into a 21% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our strong performance reflected smart and deliberate investments in the best opportunities worldwide including focused product innovations, increased advertising, enhanced digital marketing, better use of data analytics, a greater local relevance. We attracted a broader group of consumers and continued to build strong repeat rates for our products driving greater loyalty. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Korean-based Have & Be Company after having taken a minority stake four years ago. It\u2019s Dr. Jart+ skin care brand has grown rapidly with cutting-edge innovation and excellent speed to market capabilities. We are optimistic about our first acquisition in Asia and we see many opportunities to further cultivate the brand globally as consumer interest in skin care continues to expand. Our momentum continued in the first three weeks of January. But as you all know, the global environment has changed meaningfully, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. Our thoughts are with individuals who have been diagnosis and those who are more than a family in France. The Chinese government has responded in a very serious manner along with many other countries and organization and they are working entirely to address and contain the outbreak and help those afflicted. As a company, we are focused on the well-being of our employees in China and globally and are taking appropriate measures to protect them based on guidance from local authorities and the World Health Organization. Our consumer and business partners in China and elsewhere are also top of mind and we actively engage its way to support them. We are pledging RMB5 million to support coronavirus release effort for needs across China. We are matching donations of U.S. based employees to assist with the outbreak. We are working on various support initiatives to support people and their recovery. Over the past 10 years in my role as CEO, I've made numerous trips to many regions of China. I met with our local employees, talked to consumers of all ages and conferred with our business partners. I travel all over to learn more about its beautiful country its wonderful people. My heart goes out to the citizens of China during this difficult time, and I look forward to my next trip there hopefully in the near future. Although, it is difficult to anticipate the full impact of the coronavirus on our business, we expect the next couple of months will be very challenging. Chinese consumers in many big cities are staying home. And retailers are closing stores or limiting hours, in an effort to help contain the spread of the virus. Additionally, global travel is being restricted. And the effect is being felt beyond China, into major travel retail corridors and large tourist cities. Given what we know now and our experience with past epidemics, we believe our business will gradually recover towards the end of the fiscal year. We stand ready, to invest, to facilitate the recovery as soon as the market supports it, leveraging the flexibility of our resource allocation and our multiple growth drivers. We remain committed to China and to the Chinese consumers for the long-term. And plan to increase our R&D investment in the market, in order to drive both breakthrough, prestige beauty innovation for China, the Asia/Pacific region and the rest of the world. Reflecting China leadership in science, we will expand upon our existing in-market capability. And build a new state-of-art innovation center, complete with the latest technologies and tools. This facility will also highlight our passion and commitment to quality, sustainability and employee wellness. Our enhanced capability and capacity will ensure we meet the needs of Chinese and Asia consumers, with local relevancy and local trends, as well as with creativity, agility and speed. These investment aims to sustain the long-term development of our company in China, and around the world. We will continue working to advance this new development. And look forward to sharing more details in the future. Turning back to the second quarter results, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was again a star, in our portfolio. The brand grew strong double-digits globally, in both skin care and makeup and rose in every region, powered by its main hero franchises, including Advanced Night Repair as well as Re-Nutriv, Revitalizing Supreme, Micro Essence and Double Wear. This is a beautiful example of our multiple engines, not only winning across many brands, but also within a big brand. Re-Nutriv, Est\u00e9e Lauder luxury skin care line delivered superb results, supported by targeted marketing, with the luxury consumer, enhanced merchandising and desirable innovation. Looking now at our geographic results, sales advanced in every region with strength across categories. In Asia/Pacific, virtually every market grew, led by China, which accelerated, generating strong double-digit growth as all our brands, category and channels advanced. We had terrific growth from smaller cities in China, which are becoming a greater part of our business, and a promising long-term growth driver. We expanded into two new cities, bringing our total to 123. Our online business in China more than doubled, elevated by well-integrated online and offline campaigns for Singles Day. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was among Tmall best performers for the event, while M\u2022A\u2022C, La Mer and Jo Malone London, each excelled in their respective categories. Our brand expansion strategy on Tmall was a distinct advantage. As an example, following Tom Ford Beauty launched, on Tmall in 2019, the brand executed its first Singles Day to tremendous success in both fragrance and makeup. Its performance was twice that of its Tmall launch day which was our biggest launch ever on the platform. Chinese consumer interest in prestige fragrance category is rising and we are nicely positioned with our wide portfolio of luxury fragrances. Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty excelled in the quarter, helping to further diversify our business in China. We plan to launch additional luxury fragrance there later this year. We delivered strong growth in our other emerging markets, outside of China, led by terrific results in Russia, India, Thailand and Brazil. In the quarter, we continue to invest for growth and attract new consumers. For example, Brazil is the fourth largest market globally for hair care. And we launched Aveda, our 10th brand there. We are showcasing the brand historical commitment to sustainability, the environment and botanically-based product, with a salon in S\u00e3o Paulo that includes sustainable elements. Across Europe the Middle East and Africa, Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u2022A\u2022C, Clinique and La Mer, our four biggest brands, prospered demonstrating the appeal of established brands that have broad exposure to multiple subcategories and compelling innovation. Every category advanced in the region. Our skin care brand led the growth with sought-after newness from La Mer, Darphin and Origins. And the U.K. grew modestly, for the second consecutive quarter in a difficult environment and several of our brands gained share. Our growth strategy are showing promise amid macro industry-specific headwinds. In North America, we made good progress towards stabilization of the business. We learned -- we leaned into our multiple engines of growth, leveraging our successful skincare and fragrance franchises during the holiday season, in light of industry challenges in makeup. There were several bright spots. Brand representing about half of our sales grew and we had gains in the specialty-multi and online channels. In fact, La Mer delivered record Black Friday sales on its own site, driven by unique product assortment and an influencer-led holiday campaign. As we work to rejuvenate the makeup business in North America we are creating products that leverage consumer insight from our enhanced data analytics. For example, we learned consumers want product that combine skincare benefits with makeup. In response, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand just launched Futurist Hydra Rescue, a new moisturizing foundation, combining the positioning of our winning Futurist franchise in China with consumer needs in North America. The launch is off to a very strong start, with high ratings and reviews. Looking now at the channels. Our global online business delivered stellar results. Our brand sites, third-party sites and retailer sites, all grew double-digit, with broad-based strength across regions. Our online business was vibrant globally around Cyber Monday, as our brands offered well-received products and set in the important holiday gifting given season. We continue to invest in our excellent growth prospects online. We launched our brands on more third-party sites which are rising in popularity, deploy new digital payment technologies across several of our brand sites in the U.S. and expanded our loyalty programs. We reach engaged content. We have increased the time consumers spend on our brand sites and traffic has grown, increasing the inherent media value these sites provide. Travel Retail also continued its momentum. Our top eight brands grew double digits at retail, with strengths in skin care and our luxury and our artisanal fragrance brands grew strongly, aided by expanded distribution in the channel. Innovative pre-retail campaign, unique retailers' activision and effective advertising, all contributed to fantastic results. The pretail segment of Travel Retail excelled in the quarter and is becoming an increasingly important part of our business. Pretail enable us to engage with consumers before they travel, build brand equity and desirability and drive conversion. When tourism and travel resume, following containment of the coronavirus, we anticipate that pretail will continue to start. Another important highlight this quarter was the publication of our 2019 Citizenship and Sustainability Report. Last March we announced new goals and the report details our vision and progress. One of our goals is to promote ingredient transparency across our brands and Aveda led the way with an ingredient velocity on its websites. Other brands will soon follow. Innovation is the core of our company, once again helped drive our performance, accounting for over 25% of sales. We have exciting innovation from our four biggest brands coming in the second half of our fiscal year, many in their hero franchises. We believe these launches will be well received by consumers globally and these important franchises have high loyalty. We are pleased by our strong start in the first half and we are now focused on managing effectively throughout the coronavirus outbreak. We are determined to serve our consumers in the best ways possible. We believe that the efforts of the Chinese government along with leadership from around the world to contain the outbreak will prove effective. I want to thank our employees worldwide to their extraordinary efforts working through this challenging time, while supporting each other, our consumers, the communities where we work and our business. Their grace and agility are a testament to our company culture. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. Certainly, our thoughts and best wishes are with everyone managing through a very difficult situation in China and globally. We are committed to supporting our employees and other stakeholders, while we also manage the business impact as best we can during this time. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. We acquired Have & Be the owner of the Dr. Jart+ brand towards the end of December. The results for the new brand will be recorded in future periods on a one month lag, so you can expect operating results from Dr. Jart+ to be reflected in our fiscal third quarter for the first time, including the impact of purchase accounting and the interest expense on the debt we issued largely to fund this acquisition. So starting with the quarter results. Net sales for the second quarter rose 16% driven by strong growth in our international regions and improvement in North America. Sales growth in Asia, travel retail and online continue to exceed our expectations. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region net sales rose 30% with broad-based growth across the region. Sales in Greater China accelerated, rising very strong double-digits. Our sales in Mainland China continued to deliver broad-based growth across cities, brands, categories and channels and our brands saw record results on Singles Day. As expected, sales on Hong Kong declined more than 20%. Among developed markets in APAC, we again delivered double-digit sales growth in Korea this quarter. Our sales in Japan rose mid-single digits despite the October 1st, VAT increase last year that contributed to double-digit growth last quarter. And emerging markets in Southeast Asia grew high-single-digits led by Thailand. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18% with most markets contributing to growth. Our global travel retail business rose strong double-digits driven largely by like-door growth the continued rapid development of online pre-ordering and the successful introduction of newer brands like Le Labo and KILIAN. Emerging markets in the region grew double-digits led by India and Russia. Western European markets grew low to mid-single digits led by Italy, Iberia and Germany. Net sales in the Americas rose 1%, a significant improvement from last quarter. Skin care and fragrance showed good growth driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder, Origins and La Mer as well as strong holiday performances from Jo Malone and Tom Ford. Initial shipments of Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Futurist Hydra Rescue Moisturizing Makeup launch helped to partially offset the overall continued weakness in the makeup category. In North America, sales rose high-single-digits across all our online channels. Our sales in the specialty-multi channel grew double-digits, while the brick-and-mortar department store business remained challenged. From a category standpoint, skin care once again led growth this quarter. Net sales accelerated to 28% growth with strong contributions from Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Origins and Clinique. Innovations such as Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intense Reset Concentrate La Mer The Regenerating Serum and Clinique iD BB-gel contributed incremental sales and supported their hero franchises. Net sales in makeup grew 7% led by Est\u00e9e Lauder, Tom Ford and Bobbi Brown. Solid innovation and support in foundation and lip products, as well as special holiday sets and products drove growth in the category. Sales of fragrances grew 9% driven by strong holiday activations at Jo Malone, London and the launch of Metallique from Tom Ford. Fragrance sales grew across all regions, but were strongest in the Americas and in Asia. Our hair care sales rose 5% driven by the launch of the Nutriplenish line of products from Aveda and improvement at Bumble and bumble. Our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Favorable pricing and mix was partially offset by the impact of the incremental tariffs and higher obsolescence costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 130 basis points. We continue to leverage higher sales and greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs to fund advertising and strategic investments in technology and other capabilities. Operating income rose 23% and operating margin increased by 150 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11, increased 21% compared to the prior year, and the currency translation impact was negligible. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth as well as disciplined expense management and was partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. During the quarter, we acquired the remaining stake in Have & Be, the Korean-based skin care company. The transaction resulted in a one-time gain of $576 million, primarily related to the re-measurement of our previously held minority equity investment to fair value. We also recorded $777 million of impairment charges related to three of our four makeup brands a reflection of the continued challenges in the makeup category that have been most prevalent in North America. While the market momentum for makeup has slowed in the near term as we have previously discussed, the growth opportunities and the strategic value of these brands remains compelling as evidenced by our increased share and capability in specialty-multi retail the enhanced social media expertise of the brand and an increased consumer base of Gen-Z and millennials. Turning now to cash flow. For the six months, we generated $1.26 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was roughly flat with the prior year. Higher earnings were offset primarily by the timing and level of accounts payable. We invested $291 million in capital expenditures with cash and $1.04 billion to acquire the remaining equity interest in Have & Be, which was funded with debt. We also continue to return cash to stockholders by utilizing $813 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares of our stock and $330 million to pay dividends. So we ended the first six months of the fiscal year with strong net sales growth of 14% in constant currency and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, a tremendous reflection of the hard work of our teams as well as strong consumer momentum that we have in our markets. So now let's turn to our outlook for the balance of this year. The strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year, our multiple engines of growth strategy and the greater financial flexibility and agility we have built into our operating model is expected to help us to effectively manage through the short-term disruption caused by the Coronavirus outbreak. Due to the rapid escalation and the fluidity of the situation, it is both complex and difficult to predict the timing and the corresponding impact on our business. Therefore, we are not giving explicit guidance for the third quarter. We also remain mindful that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions and continued challenges in Hong Kong's retail environment could impact our second half results. For the year -- for the fiscal year, we now strive to achieve net sales growth of at least 6% to 8% in constant currency. This range is before the impact of one point of growth from the inclusion of sales from Have & Be. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.27 for the pound and 7.03 for the won for the fiscal year. With this sales guidance, EPS is expected to range between $5.60 and $5.70 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from currency translation and $0.18 dilution from the Have & Be acquisition. In constant currency, we expect EPS growth of 6% to 8%. Excluding the dilution from Have & Be, EPS growth is expected to be at least 9% to 11%, which remains in line with our long-term objectives. For the second half, net sales are expected to increase approximately 1% to 2% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point and the inclusion of Have & Be is expected to add 2 percentage points. In terms of cadence throughout the second half we have anticipated the greatest negative sales impact from the Coronavirus to be in the third quarter followed by a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter. We are severely curtailing discretionary costs, while continuing to support critical areas of growth. Leading Beauty Forward has reduced our percentage of fixed cost in our operations, which gives us greater agility to manage more effectively with slowing sales. We expect the belt tightening to have the maximum benefit in the fourth quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.86 and $1.91 before restructuring charges. This includes approximately $0.03 dilution from currency and $0.17 dilution from Have & Be, which includes some impact from the Coronavirus outbreak, purchase accounting and interest expense on the debt issuance as I mentioned previously. While our outlook for the balance of this year is uncertain, we do remain quite optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for the company. We believe we can manage through this difficult health prices while maintaining the agility to invest as needed and regain our momentum once the recovery is established. On behalf of the entire Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, we extend our deepest well wishes to those who have been affected and thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this period particularly our incredibly hardworking and wonderful team in China. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi. Good morning, guys. So just was hoping for a bit more clarity on the Coronavirus and how you guys are thinking about the potential impact longer term. I guess what we've seen with past epidemics is usually beauty demands come back pretty quickly after a couple of quarters. I know there's not a lot of visibility here and the duration of illness is obviously still a big wildcard. But just to retail any initial thoughts or context on if you think this could be an issue that impairs longer-term growth as we look out over the next few years? You talked about a gradual recovery through fiscal year end. Should we expect things to sort of ramp-up pretty quickly after that? Or how are you thinking about it in terms of longevity of impact? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : So obviously, we don't know about the specific medical health recovery timing, which is the unknown at this point. But we are in agreement with your assumption, which is basically this will have an impact in the short term and definition of short term is what is unknown today. But then after this period, there will be a recovery and people will come gradually back to normal habits. And so, we do expect to recover our momentum at the end of the health crisis. And in terms of our assumption today are in line with what you said. We assume the two quarters to be affected by the impact and we expect a normalization in fiscal year '21. That's our assumption today. The other important thing is that, we are ready to stay close to the current mitigation of the issue and resolution of the health classes as we are doing, supporting our China team and all the activities that the government is putting in place in China today. And we also will stand ready to support the recovery when the recovery will be happening and to invest behind the recovery as required by the market opportunity, but most importantly, by the needs of rebuilding the right consumption of Chinese consumers in the name of the economical development of China. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we'd talk actually a little bit about the Americas because the strength this quarter, the inflection was very notable. So I was wondering, if you could talk a bit more about how much you think this is tied to just being really proactive in promoting and getting behind I should say in fragrance and skin and holiday being the key to this. Or are you starting to see other lift that you think can carry through past holiday? And then in part with that of course we've had the news about incremental Macy's door closures this week. So, if you can just comment on the outlook for the rest of the year in the Americas. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : So, first of all, in -- as we said this quarter has contributed to the stabilization of our North America business and this has been in line with the strategy we communicated in Investor Day. And we remain committed and to continue the work of stabilization in the next months. So what happened this quarter is, first of all, we have used as anticipated much more granular insight in the market to activate our plans and much more local relevance in the activation. The other thing that happened, we have recognized the softness of the overall makeup market and that's why we have accelerated our activity in skin care and particularly fragrances during the holiday season that we have well fitting the situation and we got great results. So, we had -- if you want adjusted our engines of growth in a way that contributed to the good results. Our innovation pipeline as anticipated has been strong and the impact of innovation has improved. And so, all this have been a positive impact. We will continue to operate in that direction, but we do have still to be confront some of the headwinds. To be clear, the makeup softness, particularly the color makeup softness is continuing. As you mentioned, the closures of certain retailing stores where we do have high market share will continue although we completely share the Macy's strategy of focusing on the high-performance doors and/or gradually stopping the smaller and lower performance doors with -- as I said, we support the strategy, but obviously we will need to operate with the strategy with making sure that we retain the consumer -- the brands. And this will be difficult, but we will do our best to do that. So we need to take under account our extraordinary efforts to improve our model that are working, but also take under account there will continue to be headwinds. So our strategy remains at this point stabilization. Lauren Lieberman : Great. And just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the impact of Chinese travelers not really visiting the U.S. over the next several months just in terms of the outlook? Fabrizio Freda : That's actually a good point. We assume that there will be obviously an important reduction of Chinese travelers not visiting the U.S. in the next at least two, three months and this will have a negative impact obviously on the sales to Chinese tourists. Frankly, in this moment we are assuming in our guidance also a slowdown on any travel population. To be clear in this moment because of the coronavirus global concern, tourists in general is being reduced temporary. So, we are taking this temporary assumption -- sorry the assumption of this temporary reduction under account in our guidance. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. Thanks, so much. Tracey Travis : And I just want to add as it relates to our guidance. I mentioned the range of $1.82 to $1.91 which is within our press release. I think I mentioned a different number in our guidance for the second half. Operator : The next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Binetti : Hey guys. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on a really good quarter. So, I want to ask you on the Dr. Jart+ dilution. Could you walk us through how much the $0.18 -- we're trying to think forward I guess over the four quarters of integrating that business, how much of that is one-time in nature? And when do you see that starting to wear off or even possibly turn to an accretive position? And then I just -- I want to ask you as you think through the U.S. number a little bit, so do you think the retailers that you worked with on the holiday strategy to get more skin care and fragrance out there? They really seem to want to keep pushing on makeup even as the warning signs were showing up over the last year or two. Do you think they've gone through the psychological change yet that skin care is going to be the driver for the medium term? And are they accepting that they have to pull back more on makeup in a structural way? I guess are the gains you saw in skin care and fragrance, would you characterize those as sticky and shelf space gains that are going to remain dedicated to those categories as we look into calendar 2020? Tracey Travis : Yes. So, starting with the Have & Be dilution, we obviously have the step-up in inventory which is one-time depends on how you're treating the interest expense which is also in that number. What I would say Michael is that we expect that Have & Be will be, if you think forward, relatively flat including purchase accounting. So, eliminating those onetime items next year and accretive the following year. Michael Binetti : Okay. Tracey Travis : The makeup question is the second question? Michael Binetti : Yes. Fabrizio Freda : Sorry could you repeat who was the subject to the makeup when you said they? I didn't understand. Michael Binetti : Yes. Well, it sounds like it was a pretty meaningful acceleration. Obviously in North America or in America we can see your numbers. But it sounds like the number that you got from specialty-multi which was a great growth channel for you guys over the last few years, but slowed recently sounds like it improved a lot this quarter and it sounds like you worked with them on skin care. And I'm just wondering if you feel like that channel they feel like they've gone through the mental change of saying, look skin care is going to be the bigger driver and we're going to give them -- give that category more shelf space that sticks around calendar 2020. Fabrizio Freda : I -- frankly, yes, I think everyone realizes the power of skin care in this moment and we are all working together to leverage the power of skin care also because skin care for instant results and skincare product combined with makeup is on a growth. So, there are -- yes you speak about shelf space which obviously is a bit more gradual in the way it changes. But definitely innovation programs are reflecting a lot of this. So, there is more activity, more social media, more advertising in skin care than before and this is a reflection on the results. By the way makeup is a big category. The makeup for face meaning foundation for example is still doing very, very well. The place which is softer is color. And importantly, what we are doing to contribute not only to leverage skincare fragrances better but to reinstate growth in makeup in the future is we have accelerated the innovation in the makeup category contributing to the future results of our retail partners also in this category. So, to be clear, we are not giving up at all on makeup. We are just accepting that in the short-term, we are focusing more on other category and innovating better in makeup to reactivate the consumer interest. Michael Binetti : Thank you very much. Congrats on getting North America back to positive. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks. Good morning and let me add my congratulations. I guess my question is around Amazon. There's been some press out recently talking about them potentially evolving their model to launch some luxury brands, maybe using a concession model. If something like this was to play out, would you ever consider -- or reconsider, excuse me, Amazon as a channel for luxury beauty? And then just a follow-up on China. Can you share, Tracey, maybe what percent of physical doors have been shuttered? And are you seeing any major change in trend in the online business in China since the outbreak has escalated? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. On the first question is -- the answer is no. At this point, we are not considering Amazon, a channel for our luxury beauty products and we are focusing of our current channels and our current partners to build a continued stabilization in North America of our business. As far as the China question, is the number of physical doors, I'll let Tracey go with that. Tracey Travis : Yes. So, as you can imagine it's quite fluid. And one of the things that we've seen is the Chinese New Year extended for many, many of our employees. Our stores have closed as malls have closed. So, very recently two-thirds of our department store doors were closed and the remaining doors were on reduced hours. Now that could change next week, so this is a very fluid situation. Fabrizio Freda : And on the second part of the China question which is the online, absolutely the online channel is very strong in China and as we said in the second quarter. But in this moment also online is suffering because in this moment in the middle of the outbreak, the delivery system in homes and in the big distribution centers also people are now working like in this moment until February 10th, many people with non-essential activity in factories in other situation this is stopped. The same is for distribution centers the same for other activities. So online in -- at least in the short-term is having the same issues of brick-and-mortar. In terms of the role of online in the recovery in the future, we are optimistic that online will play a very strong role in the recovery when the recovery will happen. Erinn Murphy : Thank you for that context. All the best. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Strycula : Hi. Good morning. So, first part of my question just wanted to follow-up on Erinn's question. Can you give us a little bit more texture as to how to disaggregate how Mainland China sales are performing versus the travel retail component of the business? Primarily it's how we think about modeling the back half of the year. One of those businesses is housed within the EMEA segment. The other business is clearly housing APAC. So just want to get a little bit more texture as to which ones being more impacted real time. And then Fabrizio, if you use history as a guide post here, how do we think about once the issue is call it \"contained\" what is like the recovery path off from that moment forward? Is it typically from what you've seen before three months, four months for travel retail to come back online from flights being booked? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. So the short answer to the first question in this moment travel retail is the most impacted channel. Because if you think what -- just to give you the context of what's happening, you will probably know that more than 60 airlines just closed their flights. So in this moment the travel in and out of China is suspended in the large majority of cases. So there is lack of traffic for -- just in and out of China. Second, in general tourism in this moment is more prudent, because it's a global issue. The outbreak is a global concern. And so many people which are concerned to travel in this moment are reducing their choice or postponing some of the travel. And I'm speaking touristic travel. Then there is a third factor. Many companies have banned travel to any place -- to China, but also to any other place where there is the virus. And so business travel is being reduced not to count the many companies are reducing business travel for cost containment reasons. So in this moment, the amount of travel in airports is reduced and traffic is significantly reduced. So that's the biggest impact. The second biggest impact is obviously China Mainland itself and Hong Kong, which have reduced significance. So I would say the Greater China area, because of all the reasons that we have already discussed in the prepared remarks that I'm not going to repeat. But the most important thing is that keep in mind that until February 10 most of the cities are not even -- people are not back to work until at February children are not back to school. And people are requested rightly so not to get out of home for reasons, which are not essential and not going public transportations where there is a risk of contamination. So, the behaviors of the entire population is fundamentally changed. And because of this, this is the second area where in the short-term we expect an impact. The second part of your question is the recovery. Now the recovery we know what you know. We have studied all the previous cases in all the previous situation. And what we see is that the recovery tends to be hockey sticks, meaning, when the things is back, it's back particularly in the traveling. When traffic is back, traffic is back and the people buy. The thing that can -- that we can do more in terms of the business learning that we're applying or during the period before the recovery in travel retail will be very important to push conversion, meaning, when there is -- travel retail is built by traffic and by conversion. Conversion is an area where we're making many improvements. So in this period of transition where traffic will be low, we are reworking our plans to use conversion as a key mitigating element of the deep and then obviously we are preparing for future recovery plans when the time will arrive. The last point I want to make is that we will try to tune the recovery to the recovery of the Chinese economy and the Chinese population. We don't want just to look this as a business. We want to see -- look at this as a contribution to the recovery of the country and really supporting our employees at the country in this. And the same will happen in travel retail where for example some of our customers and retail partners are Chinese. And we are going to stay close to them to contribute to the recovery of the travel retail business to make sure that our long-term retail partners will benefit from the recovery much -- as much as possible and to start this all again to restart the right process and to regain momentum not only for us, but for the entire industry. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. And I just want to echo the congrats on your results. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you. Andrea Teixeira : So as a follow-up on the North America and the comments that you made for mix Fabrizio and obviously there was -- it's natural that in the holidays, it's more giftable skin care and fragrances. And you're also putting more -- I think prudently putting more marketing behind those lines. So do you think that innovation and momentum continue to build into the next few quarters? Or we maybe potentially have some seasonal positive impact of that into the second quarter? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So I'll start and then Fabrizio can also add his comments. We are progressing towards stabilization in North America. And clearly, it was a strong holiday and strong second quarter for us in North America and in other parts of the globe. So our teams have worked awfully hard to make this holiday season a very good one and consumers responded and we're very happy about that. As we look at the back half of the year, Fabrizio touched on the fact that we do have tourists that we expect that that business to be a bit softer given the situation that we're managing through globally. And I would also say that North America is making progressive progress. However, I would not expect that the second quarter would necessarily be reflective of continued acceleration from there. But the North America team is executing against all of the strategies that were laid out last year and we're seeing some good outcomes from that. So what we told you last quarter was North America, we expect certainly to have better performance this year than we did last year in North America. So that is progression towards stabilization. Lauren asked earlier about the Macy's announcement. And clearly, as we've been saying for some time, we believe that brick-and-mortar needs to be taken out of North America. North America has been over retailed for some time. So we are very much aligned with what Macy's has announced in their Investor Day yesterday. The doors that actually would be closing in our fiscal year were already included in our guidance. Andrea Teixeira : That's helpful. Operator : The next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks, and good morning everybody. Just wondering if you could quantify the online percentage of sales from China. And related to that also if you could just quantify the impact benefit from e-commerce accelerating consumption the enhanced availability in China. In other words, previously consumers would have to visit cities selling the product and now you're up to 123. But e-commerce obviously makes the product available everywhere. So maybe if you could just talk a bit about, how you think about that dynamic as having helped past tense sales and how you think about that on a go-forward basis and maybe if you think about some of those Tier 3 to 5 cities, which didn't readily available -- have product readily available, but now people can order online. How do you think about that in terms of accelerating demand, maintaining that demand and kind of how it will impact future growth? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. No, that's a very good question. As I commented a lot of times on the subject this is a very important phenomenon, because today we have physical distribution in China in 123 city with our most distributed brands which are Lauder and Clinique and much lower city coverage in the other brands, which are still on a growth trajectory. So it is a lot of physical distribution potential in the long-term still untapped. But at the same time, we know there is demand in China now in over 600 cities. So there are over 450 cities where there is strong demand and there is not yet physical distribution of prestige luxury and for sure prestige luxury of Est\u00e9e Lauder brands. So this demand gets filled by online and get filled by -- when there's consumer travel also travel within China like in amazing 3-Tier markets like Hainan Island then where they can access the products or when they travel for internal business or vacation like go to Beijing or to Shanghai. So that's the situation. But online cover a lot these cities and that's why also is growing and is very strategic, because it give us access to these consumers in a very productive way. The other important positive consequence of this dynamic is that the brick-and-mortar can remain very productive. It can remain very focused where there is the right productivity and online can cover productively the rest. So this is a good phenomenon continue to grow. It is definitely one of the reason behind my comment that we are having better and better results also in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities also where physical distribution has not yet arrived. In terms of percentage of sales, China is the highest percentage of sales online versus other markets. It's on high side and it's continued to grow. Operator : We have time for one more question and that question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Thanks. Thanks for the question. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on Mark's question Fabrizio. How much flexibility do you have to turn up the dial on really focusing on some of those lower tier cities that you just referenced? I'm just thinking about as kind of the year progresses and if you really wanted to turn up the dial to generate sales growth in some of these other tier cities. Do you have that kind of control in the near term? Or is it a much longer-term burn? Fabrizio Freda : I mean, we have control of the online I mean with our partners like Tmall and obviously, our own online activity. But the \u2013 remember we \u2013 our way to build distribution and also to build coverage is \u2013 we are in luxury. And for us selective distribution, which means demand ahead of supply is very important. So we gradually build the demand. And the reason why today demand is growing so fast also in the city is social media. Because while in the past advertising was local, meaning advertising was focused in the cities where there was physical distribution. Social media by definition is national. So you are in a dynamic where demand is normally ahead of supply and that's the typical demand of the good luxury market and we are filling this demand gradually and making sure that we keep the concept of desirability and high quality and high quality also the experience that we give to our consumer in mind. So we are not selling products. We are selling quality and full experiences and we only do that when we can provide the best possible service to the consumer. So the short answer is gradually, but yes, we have the capability to dial up as the market opportunity reveals itself. Nik Modi : And just a quick follow-up. Of the 450 cities you cited in China's opportunity, how many do you believe Est\u00e9e Lauder as a company has a very good handle on demand? And just a general consumer insights in those cities? Fabrizio Freda : So I will not give you specific numbers but I can tell you that we have the consumer data, so we know the number of consumers that are buying from different cities. Even we use these data analytics to decide where to open physical distribution. So we use the demand and the elements of the strength of the demand from the cities also to judge our physical distribution strategy to make sure that we continue to provide better high-touch services to the consumer when the demand is sufficient to be productive and to offer the quality and the service that we need to offer. So it's a gradual development of quality service. Nik Modi : Very helpful. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Welcome. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join for the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 :00 PM Eastern Time today through February 20. To hear a recording of the call please dial 855-859-2056, passcode 443-7719. That concludes today's Est\u00e9e Lauder conference call. I would like to thank you all for your participation and wish you all a good day.",

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Laraine Mancini : Thank you. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and other reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.  To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures on our press release and on the Investors section of our website. [Operator Instructions].  And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. I hope you are in good health during this difficult time as the world confronts COVID-19. My heart goes out to those afflicted, and my deep gratitude goes to everyone around the world who is part of the global relief efforts. Before I discuss results and our strategies to navigate through this challenging environment, I want to first thank our employees at the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. The care and compassion you have shown one another since the outbreak while also balancing new work routines for yourselves and caring for your families has been truly inspiring. Your creativity, a sense of collaboration, have risen to new heights as we have adapted our business from marketing to sales to manufacturing and more. Our employees have truly exemplified our belief in leadership from average share. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies and some of its charitable foundations have made donations to help limit the spread of the virus and ease the related hardships faced by those it affected. To date, we have made donations and commitments to Doctors Without Borders, the New York City COVID-19 Response and Impact Fund, Red Cross Society of China, Shanghai Charity Foundation, Give2Asia and Community Chest of Korea.  This week, we established the ELC Care Employee Relief Fund, our newest giving initiative, which will be funded through our contributions from the company, the Lauder family and our employees. It will provide immediate and critical financial release to employees whose lives have been impacted by the pandemic.  Our brands have also found meaningful ways to contribute. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand donated 2 million surgical masks for frontline workers in New York, while Clinique donated 50,000 skin care products to doctor and nurses in New York City's hospitals. Aveda launched Aveda Cares, a relief program to benefit independent salons and stylists in the United States. The multifacet initiative will help salons prepare to recover from COVID-19-related closures. The M.A.C VIVA GLAM Fund is continuing its decades-long giving by allocating $10 million to 250 local organization all over the world that are providing essential needs and services to people at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I'm also especially proud of how the company mobilized to manufacture hand sanitizer for frontline workers, high-risk individuals and our employees, thanks to the tremendous work of our global research development and supply chains teams. Our facility in the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium are making over 1 million hand sanitizers. Now turning to the quarter's performance. As we discussed with you on our last earnings call in early February, we expected third quarter sales to decline. After a strong January globally, we anticipated pressure in February and March in our Asia/Pacific region and our travel retail channel, given the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak at that point in time. However, COVID-19 continued to spread around the world as the quarter progressed, and social distancing measures began to impact retail traffic. As March evolved, travel was significantly curtailed and virtually all stores in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa temporarily closed, hindering consumer's primary access to supply such that the magnitude of the impact on our business was far greater than initially anticipated. In this very complex challenging environment, reported sales fell 9% in constant currency. Tracy will provide more details about our financial performance in a moment. In this volatile quarter, there were several bright spots in our business, which led to global prestige beauty share expansion. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand grew high single digits while DECIEM and Le Labo also delivered sales growth. Skincare sales grew internationally, including Dr. Jart+.  In our Asia/Pacific region, sales in Mainland China rose mid-single digit after returning to growth in March. Our online sales increased strong double digits worldwide, with growth accelerating significantly from February to March. The strength of our global travel retail business in January and February enabled it to deliver low single-digit sales growth for the quarter, excluding Dr. Jart+. Each of our 3 regions are at different stages of impact from the COVID-19 outbreak as I speak with you today. Furthermore, within regions, the extent of containment and recovery varies. As a result and given how fluid the situation is, we are continuously fine-tuning our strategies with our brand and regional teams to both manage the present and plan for the future.  Across the regions, a majority of our facilities have continued to manufacture and distribute products, though in a much reduced capacity. Most of our offices globally are operating in a work-from-home scenario, but that, too, is evolving. Our China headquarters in Shanghai has fully reopened as all employees began working in the office daily 3 weeks ago after having been on a staggered schedule for several weeks. As offices reopened, however, we are going back to work in a different way. We are employing additional safety measures for health and hygiene. We are also applying the experiences of work-from-home with new ways to collaborate and engage more effectively.  In our Asia/Pacific region, our business in Mainland China is further improving as retail stores began to reopen with shortened hours in March. By mid-April, virtually every door had reopened. We are encouraged by China efforts in containing the virus and the initial signs of recovery. We expect to return to double-digit sales growth in Mainland China in the fourth quarter. More recently, sales in Korea have begun to grow and stores have started to reopen. However, Japan, Australia and markets in Southeast Asia are still in the containment phase, with most retail stores closed as we speak. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, retail stores in most countries had been closed since early March, with the primary exception being in the Balkan Peninsula and the Nordic region. Some countries have recently announced plans to gradually reopen, most notably Germany and Italy, which are promising signs. Prior to these temporary door closures, several countries in Western Europe had been experiencing lower retail traffic as tourist abated in response to COVID-19. We expect these headwinds to persist for some time to come.  In the Americas, most retail stores have been closed since mid-March. Although retailers started seeing much lower traffic earlier in the month as social distancing began. More recently, several states in the U.S. have announced guidelines for the recovery, and we are starting to see very limited reopening with curbside pickup. We are closely monitoring the evolution of consumer behavior through this challenging time and we are developing strategies to address it. We are using sophisticated social media listening tools, machine learning and other qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Each day, we are assessing how consumers express their needs and desire, from seeking positivity, self-care and wellness to understanding their at-home needs and routines to hearing their environmental and sustainability concerns. Our successful strategy built on multiple engines of growth is as vital as ever. Our diversified portfolio of categories, channels, geographies, brands and price points give us many levers to fuel the business and will play a crucial role during recovery when stores reopen and consumers restock at home.  Our robust global skincare portfolio, vibrant online business, a broad exposure in Asia/Pacific are the primary engines of growth in this moment. This engine had tremendous momentum before COVID-19 and are playing a crucial role during containment while brick-and-mortar is closed. Let me first speak on skincare. Emerging trends are increasing the appeal of the category, bolstering already strong category dynamics. Taking care of one's skin has become an expression of self-care, which has risen in importance. Consumers are actively exploring subcategories and expanding their regimens, finding peace of mind in the ritual of their routine. Our focus on hero products is the right strategy as consumers seek brands and products they trust. Consumers are newly discovering continuing to return to our heros.  Beloved heroes like Est\u00e9e Lauder's Advanced Night Repair, La Mer, Cr\u00e8me de la Mer Treatment Lotion and Concentrate and Clinique's Moisture Surge has been seeing strong global demand online since the outbreak, demonstrating the dynamics of big brands. In this unprecedented time, we are staying true to our belief in the power of innovation on our hero franchises. We launched Est\u00e9e Lauder Perfectionist Pro Rapid Brightening Treatment, Clinique Even Better Clinical Radical Dark Spot Corrector + Interrupter and the new Eye Concentrate from La Mer.  Consumer demand has been especially compelling. In fact, for the Perfectionist Serum, its March launch on Alibaba haibox was one of Est\u00e9e Lauder's best ever on the platform. Clinique Even Better Serum is far exceeding expectation in Mainland China and has been highly sought online in the United States. And La Mer launch contributed to significant share gains in luxury on Tmall. Among our channels, online is thriving around the world. As we discussed with you at our Investor Day last year, we have long believed in the excellent growth prospects of online and have been investing in this dynamic channel for years. Our presence is global with online sales in over 50 countries. We are highly diversified with over 300 brand.com sites, over 60 brand boutiques on platforms such as Tmall and over 1,700 retail.com doors. Our online brand teams have been actively engaged since the containment measures took hold, optimizing product placement to address consumer current wants and needs and showing cases tools like virtual try-on to ease decision-making.  The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand expanded its online sales strategy to include a broader array of social selling activities from live shows on Instagram focused on self-care with global spokesmodels to live streaming from its brand sites with global and local mega-parties to live chats with consumer on its brand site, to personalized 1 :1 outreach through various communication tools. M.A.C pivoted its long-waited April launch for its newest Selena capsule collection to online and social selling to honor the commitment it had made to consumers. The brand employed an exciting digital activation in place and in-person events for the global launch to tremendous success, as the order sold out online in 2 days. Selena is the biggest collection launched to date in terms of total sales on maccosmetics.com.  Bobbi Brown began daily lesson with the brand's pro makeup artists across digital channels, a topic most requested by consumers. Initial signs are positive, and the brand is welcoming all new consumer, thanks to this always-on artistry initiative. Jo Malone London has seen an influx of activity with its digital communities as consumers have sought to elevate and uplift their space with the power of scent. China, the brand's home fragrances in bath and body categories have doubled their mix of business.  Through our action like this, in recent weeks, we drove conversion rates sharply higher, and our sales have risen across all demographics. I'm especially encouraged by the online growth we have seen from the ageless consumers. Globally, our brands are seeing increases in new consumers of 3 to 4x. Some rates are even higher. For La Mer in the United Kingdom, new consumer acquisition is higher by 5x; while in Thailand, across all brands, it is higher by 8x. As consumer behaviors evolve during this time, we are hersening more data, leveraging our analytics capability to derive even better consumer insight to provide even better service.  When retail stores reopen, we will be in a stronger position to further unlock the potential of omnichannel. We are also focusing on the areas of most immediate opportunity in Asia/Pacific, with Mainland China as of March and Korea as of April moving from containment to recovery. We told you on our last earnings call that we stood ready to facilitate recovery as soon as the market supported it and we are doing just that. In Mainland China, we successfully piloted emerging business model for online and department stores to adapt to the change in landscape. For La Mer, personalized service across channels with curated and targeted communication drove both online sales and department store sales significantly higher in the month of March. The strength of the La Mer repeat business model has been a key factor for its strong recovery and contributed to the brand's outstanding prestige beauty share gains in Mainland China in the quarter.  As countries in Asia/Pacific move into recovery, we are mindful of the consumer in these markets who traditionally purchase our products in travel retail but not able to do so with air travel largely curtailed. Our regional brand leads are working to meet this consumer demand in markets, be it in department stores, specialty-multi, freestanding stores or online. Our travel retail team is also actively engaged as destinations in the channel reopen, already driving positive trends in Hainan or Macau. We remain focused on meeting the needs of Chinese and Asia consumers with local relevancy and local trends. Since we last spoke in February, we have advanced our work toward our new investment in a state-of-art innovation center, which will open in Shanghai.  In closing, this unprecedented time, I'm moved by how deeply we are leading our company values and how our intent of becoming an even better company through this challenging moment. With our extraordinary people and our successful strategy built on a multiple engine of growth, we stand ready to emerge strongly when the global recovery begins. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. COVID-19 is certainly proving to be the most significant challenge we have faced as a public company, as much of our brick-and-mortar distribution globally has been deemed nonessential during the quarter by several jurisdictions and remains closed today. We continue to do our best to support our communities and our employees while also working to mitigate the business impact during this time.  As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. So looking at our third quarter results. Net sales fell 10%, driven by the rapidly evolving impacts from COVID-19 that occurred throughout the quarter. As the majority of our brick-and-mortar distribution throughout the world was closed as the quarter progressed, we quickly pivoted to drive sales online. Our online growth accelerated sharply at the end of March and continued to rise in April. Sales grew in travel retail from a strong January and February before travel restrictions were enacted and skincare remained our most resilient category. The Americas region and the makeup category suffered the biggest shortfalls. The December acquisition of Dr. Jart+ added approximately 2 points of net sales growth. Our gross margin decreased 320 basis points compared to the third quarter last year due to a combination of factors. In the first 7 months of our fiscal year, we saw outstanding growth in our skincare category, much of it in Asia and in travel retail. To meet what has now been our third year of double-digit demand for our products, we supplemented our internal manufacturing capacity with additional third-party suppliers, and we incurred increased air freight to support sales growth in areas distant from our manufacturing facilities. This resulted in higher supply chain costs in our third quarter.  The impact of increased tariffs, higher obsolescence and promotional activity also contributed as well as the inventory step-up related to Dr. Jart+. Previous initiatives like Leading Beauty Forward, which is still projected to contribute approximately $425 million to $475 million in net savings by fiscal 2021, have put us on much stronger footing to weather normal economic downturns. However, the impact of COVID-19 has not been a normal downturn. The sudden and dramatic change in sales growth from the beginning of the third quarter to the end created a deleverage effect that could not be offset quickly enough by the significant cost actions we took, which totaled approximately $250 million. Therefore, operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 250 basis points.  As we told you last quarter, we expect to see a greater impact from our third quarter cost actions, including advertising and promotion reductions more aligned to sales performance, a hiring curtailment and the benefits of work from home, which yielded sharply reduced travel and meeting expense as well as consulting expenses in our fourth quarter. As it became apparent that store closures and social distancing measures would move beyond China to be adopted around the world, we implemented even more cost actions that will have a more meaningful impact on curtailment of expenses beginning in May. These primarily include furloughs and other leaves of absence as well as temporary reduction in compensation for management and board members.  The capabilities we have built and the actions we are taking now enable us to manage through the situation today while funding targeted strategic investments going forward, which will position us well to emerge strongly when the recovery is more apparent. Our interest expense rose by $11 million to $28 million during the quarter, reflecting higher debt levels to finance the acquisition of Dr. Jart+. Our effective tax rate increased to 30.5% from 22.1% in last year's third quarter, primarily attributable to a higher effective rate on the company's foreign operations due to the mix of earnings. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 fell 45% compared to the prior year. Currency diluted EPS by $0.01 and the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ diluted EPS by approximately $0.03. During the quarter, we recorded $346 million of impairment charges related to 4 brands and certain freestanding retail stores that have been further challenged by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand. We believe that our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity provide core competitive advantages for our company, demonstrating the importance of scale. These position us to not only manage through a crisis but to emerge from it stronger.  During the quarter, we borrowed $1.3 billion under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding, ending the quarter with nearly $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In April, we issued $700 million of 2.6% 10-year senior notes in order to further enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity and repaid the commercial paper with the remaining capacity under the revolving credit facility. We were able to do all of this while maintaining our strong single A credit rating.  For the 9 months, we generated $1.95 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, an increase of 11% from the prior year. We invested $468 million in capital expenditures and $1.04 billion to acquire the remaining interest in Dr. Jart+. We also used $883 million to repurchase shares and $502 million to pay dividends. To further enhance near-term liquidity, we are focusing our capital investment on areas necessary for future growth and paring back in areas such as retail renovations and office improvements. We cut our planned capital expenditures by 1/3 and now expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million for the full year. Additionally, we have suspended share repurchases for the balance of this fiscal year and our quarterly dividend that would have been paid in June of 2020. All of these activities greatly enhance our ability to manage through the shutdown in brick-and-mortar for an extended period of time while we focus on stimulating greater consumption online.  History has not provided any truly comparable recent events we can use as guidance concerning the effects of the global pandemic. The disruption to our business caused by COVID-19 has clearly been more widespread and more pronounced than we had expected it would be when we last spoke with you just a few months ago in February. We delivered remarkably strong double-digit growth in sales and adjusted EPS through January, but that was followed by the dramatic spread of the pandemic and the related door closings and curtailment of travel that we spoke about. Due to the fluidity of the situation, it is both complex and difficult to predict the duration or the timing and trajectory of the recovery and the corresponding impact on our business. At this point, in the fourth quarter, the majority of our distribution, with the exception of China and a few other markets, remains closed. And while we are encouraged by the weekly acceleration of our global online business, we do not have enough visibility into the progression of the rest of the business until more retail doors open in the coming months. And we do believe traffic could initially return at a slower pace as some consumers remain tentative until a treatment is developed.  Therefore, given the level of uncertainty, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the year. That said, there are a few guideposts that we can provide to you. The inclusion of 6 months of sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ should add about 1 percentage point to sales growth for the year. It is expected to dilute EPS by about $0.14 due to purchase accounting. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.11 for the euro, $1.26 for the pound and $7.03 for the won for the fiscal year. The related EPS dilution should be approximately $0.05.  We are very encouraged as we see the beginnings of recovery in China and markets around the world begin to discuss gradually lifting retail and travel restrictions as the virus abates. We expect strong online acceleration to continue as underlying consumer demand is driving both replenishment and new customers online. However, unlike the third quarter where many of our global doors were opened until the last month of the quarter, we expect that most of our retail distribution will remain closed for much of the fourth quarter, and consumer traffic will likely recover slowly in brick-and-mortar. We expect greater sales and margin declines in the fourth quarter as a result. We estimate that global prestige beauty will decline double digits in the second half of our fiscal year.  We are also mindful of the risk of a global recession and a slow recovery in employment impacting consumer sentiment and discretionary spending. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter will reflect the adverse conditions we have been experiencing in March and April. The sudden and dramatic change to our volume forecast is expected to trigger an accounting rule requiring us to recognize the impact of reduced manufacturing volumes on our standard costs. Our plants have been running at meaningfully reduced capacity, reflecting some temporary plant closures as well as reduced efficiencies to accommodate social distancing requirements, staggered shift changes and other changes necessary in this environment. We are also required to recognize expenses related to manufacturing employees who are not working. These expenses are now recognized in the current period instead of when the product is sold. The inclusion of Dr. Jart+, with the impact of the inventory step-up, will also pressure our gross margin. We expect our belt-tightening efforts to have a more pronounced impact in the fourth quarter to partially offset the negative impacts I've discussed. We are implementing some of the additional actions in May and expect to deliver fourth quarter savings of between $500 million and $600 million. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately for 24%.  So those are some of the guideposts that we can provide to you for the year. We are committed to continue to take the appropriate actions to rationalize our cost base relative to the new normal and return as quickly as possible to both sales growth and margin expansion as the COVID-19 situation stabilizes during the course of fiscal 2021. We delivered tremendous sales and profit growth through the first half of the year as our business continued to benefit from the strategic actions we took over the past several years to position our company for sustainable, profitable growth. And while the unfortunate temporary shock of COVID-19 has made our outlook for the balance of this year uncertain, we have taken appropriate action to mitigate the effects of the pandemic while continuing to protect our business to be able to be well positioned for both the near-term recovery and the long-term opportunities inherent in global prestige beauty.  On behalf of Fabrizio and the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's leadership team, we extend our immense gratitude to all of our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. I wanted first to talk about -- so many questions. So I wanted first to talk about -- I have so many questions. So I wanted first to talk about travel retail and just what your data and analytics have told you over time about the sales historically through that channel. How much of it is sort of impulse? How much of it is new consumers discovering your brands? How much of it is sales that would have or could happen elsewhere like a replenishment-type sale when someone travels? Because that could inform thinking about your ability to recapture some of that sales or what degree of that sales, even assuming global travel remains suppressed for a good amount of time. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. I think, first of all, your assumption is correct. Our data confirms that those are consumers that while traveling are buying, discovering or replenishing their products. So then there is business travel, where people that travel for business bring back some gifts, and obviously, this creates consumption. But in travel retail, the most successful products all over the world tend to be what we call our hero products, so the products which have high loyalty, a high repurchase rate because both as a gift and as for personal consumption, which are the 2 drivers of travel retail, people really want to buy products that they are pretty sure will either replenish their habits or create exciting gifts.  In that sense, there is the possibility to recover at least part of the travel retail sales in the country of origins. And we are working on this in every country, many emerging markets, in China, in U.S., in Europe. And so there is a project to do this as much as possible. However, in this moment, to be very clear, travel retail in Europe and U.S. is basically closed. And so in the quarter 4, there is a very big issue of closures that is in the middle of the travel retail sales, which are possible in the short term.  In Asia, we are seeing already amazing results when there are openings. In this moment, the travel retail within China, particularly in the Hainan island or the travel retail in Korea, the travel retail in Hong Kong, Macau, these start already coming back and is delivering good growth. We are focusing, in this case, very much more on conversion and is working. So it again is a word to tail. But the real travel retail recovery will start happening in fiscal year '21 with the gradual reopening of travel and will be probably one of the most gradual reopening in the recovery from our expectation and from our data. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hope you're well. I guess, is it possible that you could talk a little bit more about what you saw in March relative to January, February and what you've been seeing in April across your key categories, geographies and channels? Because I think that, too, would help inform at least the near-term visibility. And I guess, relatedly, if you're able -- it sounds like you have line of sight to some belt-tightening initiatives in the fourth quarter, but I'm trying to juxtapose that against some of the near-term manufacturing and other COVID-related headwinds that you spoke to, Tracey. So just a little bit more color about what you've seen and are seeing in the moment while things are shut down. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. I'll start from what we're seeing on the sales side and then let Tracey cover all the financial implications and the financial aspects. So the recovery, first of all, is very different by region because the COVID-19 issue is a different speed and a different level of depth in different markets, and some markets are already, as you know, in recovery, other markets are still in the middle of the issue. So we are managing things in a very differentiated set of way by region, by country.  So what we see in this moment is that in -- still, the closures are in Europe and U.S. are 90%, 12%. If you have seen some of the data that are emerging on the situation in United States in the last week of March or the first week of April, the market was minus 70%, and the brick-and-mortar closure has a very big impact. So this -- we see the month of March, the month of April and part of month of May where closures are very big in EMEA and in North America, has been probably the worst moment for that region. And then we see a gradual recovery as the brick-and-mortar will open in these regions, meaning Europe and America. And also in Europe and America, we see already an extraordinary progress of the online. That's the key important point.  On the other side, in places -- in April, in places like China, Korea, Taiwan, we see already double-digit growth. We already see the recovery being very active. And that, for us, is very encouraging because it shows that as soon as there is a recovery, as soon as there is a recovery from the consumer point of view, so when the consumer are back with the spirit of really going back to their normal habits like is starting, as I said, in China, Korea or Taiwan, the double-digit growth comes back fast. And because we are seeing -- we see both increased consumption, we see a restocking in consumer homes and we see a restocking in trade, which happen at the same time. So the recovery is strong, but the recovery is for the moment only in these areas, and I said, is in global online.  In global online, most of the areas of the world is double digit but there are areas which are triple digit. And then the recovery, as I said, started in very few travel retail stores which are open, as I said, mainly in China and Korea, but the rest of the world for the moment is still closed. And so in fiscal year '21, we expect to see all the engines, meaning including the European and U.S. brick-and-mortar gradually coming back. But as Tracey has clarified in her prepared remarks, we believe the comeback of brick-and-mortar will be gradual. We have signs of this already in Asia, where the recovery really starts online and starts gradually in brick-and-mortar and brick-and-mortar acceleration takes much more time because it takes not only the technical reopening but takes the consumer confidence to buy and brick-and-mortar comes back. And this will only come back more gradually. So that's what we see. In summary, we see faster recovery in Asia for the moment, a lot of closures still in Europe and U.S., very fast recovery online globally and a more gradual recovery in travel retail. Tracey Travis : And Steve, to your question on the cost savings and the manufacturing variance. The way I would think about that in the fourth quarter, the $500 million to $600 million of cost savings, about 1/3 of it is related to employee actions and the other 2/3 related to other expense areas that we've stepped up in terms of our cost savings, advertising, consulting, travel, et cetera. So that's generally the split in the fourth quarter. As it relates to our gross profit margin and you saw the impact in the third quarter, we expect that we will continue to see, in the fourth quarter, the impact obviously of the tariffs and of the higher third-party sourcing costs that will impact us in the fourth quarter. In addition to that, I spoke about the under-absorption of some of our overhead and labor costs that we need to expense in the fourth quarter. So the bigger impact will be in the fourth quarter on that. So our gross profit margins will decline further in the fourth quarter related to those onetime issues related to the lower production volumes. As we increase production volumes as we emerge out of COVID-19, that will correct itself. Operator : And our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Olivia Tong : I wanted to ask you about just your sales. And I think it's fairly impressive that China was only down for the month of February and that travel retail was still up in the quarter. But the U.S. decline was pretty staggering. So as we start thinking about when Western markets start to reopen, can you talk about the differences not only in underlying demand in these key markets, but obviously, your infrastructure? Because clearly, e-commerce penetration is significantly higher in Asia than in the U.S. So can you talk about just your infrastructure? Is e-commerce better developed just in China overall? And how do you compare for that? And then just thinking later in the year, I know it's still pretty far away, but how -- what's guiding how you plan for holidays, Singles Day and things down the road as we think about the future? Fabrizio Freda : So I'll start, and then Tracey will add perspective. Is -- so the penetration online actually is very strong in the United States, in the U.K. and in China. Those are the 3 markets where we have the stronger penetration online, where the market is very well-developed online. So in terms of how we see the situation in the U.S., obviously, our stabilization plan in the U.S. have been postponed by the COVID issue that emerged, so we'll take a bit more time than what we originally were hoping in -- when we had an encouraging last quarter in calendar year '19.  So -- but it is because of the closures of the brick-and-mortar. In the United States, the online acceleration is outstanding as we speak. And so actually, it's very reassuring to us that the percentage of our business online will dramatically increase. Now this was already planned for the long term, but this issue has accelerated it. And as I explained in my prepared remarks, what we are seeing in the U.K., in the U.S. and in China, that the -- particularly the ageless consumer, so the consumer is about 50, 55, that, as you know, the online was the -- mainly for millennials and the new generations. But frankly, all these other consumers now are extra consumers that are using e-commerce much more in all its aspects. And we believe that this change is here to stay. And so the increase or the percentage of business online, including retail.com, so it's not only brand.com, it's retail.com, it's platforms in China and in other parts of the world, is pure plays in the U.K.  So in all the online channels, there is an increase of percentage of sales that goes online. To be clear, for the long term, this is positive to us. It's very positive. Online has always been one of our key drivers, one of our profitable drivers, and most importantly, make a stronger platform for the future of omnichannel, which is the way also particularly in luxury. The distribution models will evolve on all fronts. So good development and we believe this is positive. Tracey, do you want to add perspective? Tracey Travis : Then on our infrastructure as well as our plans for holiday, clearly, we are mindful of and watching very closely in terms of as doors open, the productivity of those doors. So certainly, both with our retail partners as well as our own freestanding stores, just making sure as doors open, that they are productive, that they are profitable. And we will, as we have over the last few years, take appropriate actions if we find that we do emerge out of this with brick-and-mortar doors that are less profitable than we would like for them to be. As it relates to holiday, at the same time, one of the things that Fabrizio, when he was speaking about online, the inference there is we are very much focused on the fact that demand remains strong. And it's really the access to our products that has become challenging in markets like in Europe as well as in the Americas. So lots of activity or programs shifting to online really to make sure that people can access our products. We also are focused on, for holiday, what we think holiday will be like. We actually are hoping that by holiday, things stabilize a bit. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are mindful that there could be a recession, certainly impact, but hoping that by holiday, people are ready to shop again. So our holiday programs remain intact. The quantities may be adjusted a bit, given how much demand has come back by that time. Operator : And our next question comes from Erinn Murphy from Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : And I hope you both are well as well. I guess a follow-up just to the Americas, Tracey, for you. When you think about sales down 23%, it was worse than we thought. Could you just quantify how much was truly the decline from store closures in the last 2 to 3 weeks of the quarter versus maybe pulling back on wholesale sell-in? And then bigger picture, as you think about the mix of business in the Americas, I guess, Fabrizio, you already addressed online clearly accelerating. But I'm more curious on kind of how you think about the reliance or the toggles between the department store, the specialty multi-channel as well as the freestanding stores on the other side of this crisis. Tracey Travis : Sure. So I mean in January, as Fabrizio mentioned, we actually saw positive growth in all of our markets, including in the Americas. We actually started to see some softness towards the end of February. And to your point, the doors were not closed but certainly, it was apparent by that time that COVID-19 was starting to spread, and consumers were starting to get a bit nervous about shopping in-store and really focusing on stocking up on more essentials. And then March, we saw the biggest impact obviously with the doors closed, half of March, but really the early part of March, a tremendous decline in shopping because of the tentativeness of the consumer and really the consumer focused understandably so on health and essentials for their homes and their families. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And the other thing I want to add is, obviously, our job is also to protect our profitability. And when we saw this evolving, we started spending less already in February. And then in March, also our spending was reduced in order to mitigate the impact of the thing. So to be clear, we are anticipating the events. And so the spending was reduced, already starting gradually in February. The consumer sentiment started going down already in February. And then in March, when the closures started in United States, sales went to 0 because basically brick-and-mortar completely closed and the consumer was shocked, the retailers stopped ordering. So you need to see the month of March like a very big, deep moment. And that's why the overall number was -- or the quarter was negative.  But to be clear, until January included and already was true in the last quarter of calendar '19, we were stabilizing the business and this was going on the positive trends. And again, we plan, when the market will be back, to go back to our stabilization program. In terms of what will happen, to your question on what will happen to the other part of the business, which is not online, obviously, if the percentage of online business will increase, the rest will be reduced. And so in our opinion, there will be closures, there will be a reduction of brick-and-mortar stores overall. And this will make the brick-and-mortar stores more productive and the ability to deliver experience better. So we don't see this negative -- necessarily as negatively short in the long term. It will be obviously a negative in the short term.  And we see the future of freestanding store and brand.com being an omnichannel future. In this period, it's fascinating to see how consumers are learning different way to use the online, the concept of last mile, the role of the small convenience stores, meaning freestanding store versus brand.com, how the 2 combined can create new experiences. So there's going to be some interesting, and frankly, in our opinion, promising evolution of the ability to serve the consumer in a luxury environment in the future. But the transition is going to be complex, difficult. And in the transition, the biggest opportunity is the strong growth of online. And again for us, this is also a positive because we have a great infrastructure. We are very strong in brand.com, in retail.com, in platform, in pure plays, depending on which part of the world, there are -- this channel had a different percentage of the online business, but we are well covered in each one of them. And so driving this across the globe and in the United States is going to be in the transition out of COVID, the strongest opportunity. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Binetti from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Binetti : I guess, Fabrizio, just to follow that question in the Americas. I guess you said January is positive and February a bit slower, so March deeply negative. I guess, still to average out to negative 23%, it seems like you held some inventories that were probably ordered by the retailers in the U.S. when you saw this coming. Maybe you could comment on, as we look to reopening, what were going -- what kind of inventory levels out in the channel you see that we're going to be working with as we reopen in the U.S., I guess? And then, I guess, just go back to travel for a minute to get to the positive number. We're just looking at some of the passenger data in China.  Looks like it was down maybe 70% or 80% through February. So to get your number to be positive in travel, I think you've commented to us that Chinese consumer is about half of that business before. It speaks to very big growth rates in Europe and in the U.S. for your entire business to land a positive in the quarter. I'm just wondering, I know you said it to be into fiscal '21 until we really see a bona fide recovery in travel. But it seems like you've done some things in that channel that are driving a pretty meaningful share gain in the travel locations that were open heading into this. I wonder if you could comment on any of the strategy there that you think stands out recently. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. I'll start answer your travel question and then Tracey will go on the inventory and -- question. So -- but basically, you're right. I think what you were describing is what happened, but let me summarize it, is January was another extraordinary month for travel. So that's also what is in the mix. So in January, remember, January is Chinese New Year. So -- and Chinese New Year, yes, started to be impacted but still some of it happened. And so we gained market share. We were planning to do that. We had an amazing program in all the areas that were open and not only, but -- so travel was strong in the October, December period and continued to be very strong in general.  Then in February, there was a slowdown obviously but travel remained open in other part of the world. And then in March, travel really was closing. So yes, in travel in the month of March was the worst month. So the mix of the 3 months explained our strong market share performance in the quarter. I believe our market share performance in travel will continue, but the market in quarter 4 will be probably the worst in travel retail because Europe and U.S. have really closed. And in Asia, as I said, there is many Asia stores which are closed. There are 3 really active areas, which is within China, the domestic travel with Hainan to reach the center, which has been reactivated at a certain percentage, not fully, but with much higher conversion from travelers to purchases.  So the key point here, remember that about 10% of travel buy something. The moment travel get reduced but is open and 30%, 40% of travel buy something for several reasons, because of good marketing, because there is less people, because it's easier, because less crowded, because there are good activities, this changes. And so in this moment, we are really seeing active few doors but very important ones with very high conversion rates. And that's what is -- but then one -- the other thing which is encouraging in our travel retail reading in this moment is that in the moment, most of the world is closed, but when we see openings, the consumer is back very fast because the traffic will only be back gradually but the conversion rates can be much better. And last thing I want to say, the other thing, which is the positive expectation for the long term in travel retail also in this class is also in travel retail, the percentage of business in retail, meaning the ability to prebook online when travel, is increasing. And as you can imagine, we have great capabilities in that. We have a good structure. We have invested in that. So we are ready. And you can imagine that in this area, particularly in the period of transition where sales retail will still be important also while traveling, you can expect a continuous increase of the online part also in travel retail. So very tough quarter for travel retail, but still, I believe that the long term of travel retail will remain extraordinarily strong and extraordinarily promising. Tracey Travis : And as far as the inventory in the trade, in our -- with our wholesale customers, clearly with stores closed 6 to 7 weeks, I would say the early part of the door closures we saw -- we started to see a slow pickup in online. And as we indicated, it has really progressed. So certainly, our retailers, those that can share inventory between their brick-and-mortar and their online sites have been drawn down on some of the store -- inventory planned for stores on their retailer.com sites. And we've seen those progress quite nicely and sales really picking up strongly in the last 2 to 3 weeks in particular.  So as doors open, we expect that from a shipment standpoint, we'll see a slow reorder from a replenishment standpoint, certainly from some of the move -- the fast movers that have moved most quickly on retailer.com sites. But as the quarter progresses, we would expect shipments to gradually strengthen throughout the quarter, and by June, really be much stronger. Operator : And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Glad to hear everyone's healthy and safe. With the expense reductions that you've put in place, how much of it do you think could be permanent versus transitory? And lastly, with the innovation plans underway, any shifts in timing and launches, given the current situation? Tracey Travis : So as you know, Dana, as we've announced, we have taken some short-term cost actions to improve the liquidity situation, and we announced those in the middle of April and so those are some of the employee actions that we've taken. And then some of the other actions are also short term as it relates to advertising, really rightsizing more our advertising to the current sales trends, which will obviously pick up as our sales trends pick up.  There are other areas like travel. I think we're all getting used to the ability to work from home and communicate online. And so there are other areas that are more discretionary that we certainly are looking at more permanently, having cost reductions in some of those other cost areas. So -- but it's something that, as you know, we have ongoing cost management programs in addition to the program for Leading Beauty Forward, we have other cost actions, and we take advantage of the opportunities that we see to lock in savings whenever we can. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And I just want to add to this for the long term also, what were the most -- the best drivers for our growth before the crisis are the one which are coming better stronger. That seems to be the one that will come out stronger out of the crisis. If you think that online channels globally is coming out stronger, the Chinese consumers is recovering first and stronger. Skincare is recovering first and stronger than any other part. And within makeup, face makeup, within fragrance or seasonal fragrances and within travel retail, the very efficient travel retail doors of Asia are recovering faster.  So our key drivers of growth are recovering first and stronger for the long term. So said in other words, I see all the signs that the key drivers of growth will come out of this crisis stronger for the long term. And even if in the short term, we are going to be hit hard by the closures, particularly by the very understandable consumer shock in this moment in the medium, long term, we will be a stronger organization with our key long-term drivers further validated.  And one of these drivers will remain innovation, to answer your last question, is on innovation. We are continuing to innovate. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are reinforcing and investing in a Shanghai center to make sure that our innovation become even more relevant to Asia and to the Asian consumers and to the Chinese consumers, particularly. And we have a focus in our innovations much more than before in this period -- in this period of transition. We are focusing our ratio on fewer and bigger innovation. We are focusing our innovation on what works better online in this transition or trying to pivot online where possible because of the closures. And we have focused our innovation on hero franchises, meaning on the franchises, which are -- that have high consumer loyalty and high consumer awareness because in this moment of transition, in the middle of the crisis and out of the COVID crisis, we clearly see the consumers are interested in the brands they trust, in the product they know. They go back first to loyalty even before very new adventures. And so we are reflecting this in our innovation plan that in this moment, I believe, is one of the strongest we have had.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Rainey Mancini : Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and other reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. For clarity, I would like to remind you that references to online sales include sales of our products from our online channel, including Brand.com and third party platforms, as well as estimated sales of our products through our retailer\u2019s websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey and Hello, everyone. Fiscal Year 2020 was truly a year without parallel as we delivered one of our strongest first half on record and navigated with agility through a unprecedented pandemic in the second half. In both of these dramatically different halves, our employees lead with the extraordinary passion, creativity and resiliency. Our hearts continue to be with everyone impacted by COVID-19 and we remain focused on the safety and well being of our employees, their families and consumers. The second half of our fiscal year also marked a period of profound paid, strategic events in the United States highlighted the systemic racial injustice that has plagued our society for far too long. In June, we announced a comprehensive set of commitments to act with urgency on achieving racial equity. We stand in solidarity with our black employees, black consumers and black communities and certainly know black lives matter. Among our many commitments, we are listening and learning to foster stronger internal culture and advocacy and inclusion. We are focusing on talent and opportunity to ensure that we are providing more equitable access to professional development and advancement for our black employees. We are ensuring that the end-to-end creative process accurately and consistently represents the black experience and engages black professionals. We are investing for change through a three year $10 million pledge for the company, our brands, our foundation, employee matching gifts and the Lauder family to support nonprofits and are in the process of making the initial $5 million donation. Since announcing our commitments, we have held 30 town halls with our employees and began to identify gaps in our professional development and advancement opportunity for our existing black talent. We have also engaged a diversity focused recruitment firm and created new diversity recruitment resources. We have commitment to doing more as a live in our company and in our communities. In the last few months, the company and our employees have also made donations and pledges to organization around the world to help limit the spread of COVID-19 and eased the related hardship phase by the communities in which we live and work. We made hand sanitizer for frontline workers, high risk individuals and our employees. The production continues in this date at our facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland. Our brands have found meaningful ways to offer support, and Aveda is a shining example, it\u2019s initiative for salon owners and stylists serve to connect the educate, as well as to provide financial and business assistance. By offering a standard payments term, online sales, reopening toolkits and over 1,000 hours of virtual education, Aveda actively assisted its network during this challenging period of salon closures. Turning now to the year's performance. In the first half of fiscal year 2020, sales rose 14% and adjusted EPS climbed to 20%. Our continued outperformance yielded strong global prestige due to share gains. In fact, our gains accelerated in calendar 2019. We were well on our way to a third fiscal year double digit sales and adjusted EPS growth. Despite extensive temporary store closures worldwide in the second half as COVID-19 pandemic took hold, sales fell only 20% and we were profitable as we quickly pivoted to online to capture consumption and adjust our cost structure. Our multiple engines of growth strategy, which has powered our success for over decade, continues to be highly effectively. The company diversified prestige beauty portfolio give us many levers to drive the business. Our robust global skincare portfolio, vibrant online business, a broad exposure to Asia-Pacific are the engines of this moment. And then we enjoyed both strong and growing prestige beauty share and profitability. Across these engines, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand's performance was magnificent in fiscal year 2020, as it achieved its third consecutive year of double digit sales growth. Impressively, the brand hero franchises of Advanced Night Repair, Revitalizing Supreme, Perfectionist, Re-Nutriv and Micro Essence, all contributed meaningfully to growth. For the fiscal year, skincare performed exceptionally well, Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Tom Ford, Origins, Darphin and Le Labo drove growth organically, while the category also benefit from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. We delivered excellent performance across subcategories, owning to strong repeat purchase rates, data analytics driven marketing, new social selling strategies developed during COVID-19 and highly desirable innovation. Among the subcategories, demand for watery lotions is soaring as a hydrating step before serums and moisturizers in the new era of self care. Est\u00e9e Lauder Macro Essence, La Mer, The Treatment Lotion, Origins, Dr. Weil Mega Mushroom Treatment Lotion, delivered outstanding growth for the fiscal year and we expect to continue our ability in this compelling subcategory. Beyond watery lotions, our serums in high care subcategories are prospering. For serums, cherished heroes like Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair and innovation from clinic even better line and Est\u00e9e Lauder Perfectionist and the Re-Nutriv franchise bolstered growth in fiscal year 2020. La Mer new Eye Concentrate launched a few months ago has been highly sold as consumers are embracing its lighter texture and new claims. In EMEA, the product was the best seller on La Mer.com in the fourth quarter. Trusted brands like Clinique, flourished online when brick and mortar closed. In the fourth quarter, Clinique US prestige beauty share rose on retailer.com solidifying its number one rank. Sales on Clinique.com were the largest across all our brand sites in the quarter, driven by heroes\u2019 dramatically different moisturizing lotion and moisture surge. Clinique promise to deliver products that are simple, safe and effective for skin is resonating largely online. Our online business surged worldwide in fiscal 2020. It delivered nearly triple digit organic sales growth in the fourth quarter, which is a testament to the capabilities and scale we had built, each our Brand.com, brand boutiques and platforms, such as Tmall and retailer.com doors, contributed meaningfully. On our brand sites, in particular, we deliver nearly 90% organic sales growth globally in the fourth quarter as we increased investments to offer the best high-touch services. We quickly evolved our live chat capability to offer detail. We also announced our virtual try-on to include more categories. We rapidly deployed live streaming first in mainland China and then globally, engaging make up artists, as well as brand ambassadors for tutorials. Our live streams are shoppable, meaning that consumers can make purchases within the event. Across the brands, traffic grew significantly in the fourth quarter and conversion rates rose dramatically. Encouragingly, we saw strong growth in engagement and repeat purchase behaviors. both new and existing consumers shopped our brand sites more frequently, as for example, with Origins and Est\u00e9e Lauder in the United States, reinforcing the great work we are doing to cultivate and retain consumer through this moment. Consumer had discovered new shopping habits online that are enduring and this is true of all ages. Clinique\u2019s live streaming series designed to both entertain and educate led consumer to return more frequently, spend four times longer on site and convert at far higher levels. The brand drew live streaming event with Clinique global ambassador, Emilia Clarke, surpassed the newly elevated conversion levels. Bobbi Brown launched its artistry like never before program in May, offering consumers one-on-one and small group video consultations with national make up artists. These engaging sections range from 15 to 60 minutes with the 30 minute makeup bag makeover sessions is the most popular. Conversion rates are incredibly strong with the high level of units per transaction. Bobbi Brown continues to scale this program globally to meet the increasing demand. This is just one example of the many ways our brands are building community through this challenging moment, and we see this as an exciting evolution of the shopping experience for the future. Aveda, which led our brands by first launching its ingredient glossary earlier in the year is seeing guests we engage with a glossary spend three times more time on avida.com than average. Rather acting on our commitment to ingredient transparency, Clinique, La Mer and Origins, launched the ingredient glossaries in the fourth quarter, and we have more to come in fiscal year 2021. We maintained our strategy focused on key online shopping events throughout the year. Our advanced planning for these events delivered outstanding results. For the 618 midyear shopping festival, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand sales on Tmall tripled and its sales ranked second among all prestige beauty brands. Our Asia Pacific region delivered superior sales growth in fiscal year 2020. Every category in the region expanded, led by accelerating growth in skincare. Fragrance also accelerated as consumer desire in the region for our portfolio of luxury and artisanal fragrance build. Mainland China performed exceptionally with its sales rising roughly 60% organically in the fourth quarter. Korea and several other markets also grew for the year and for quarter, driving prestige beauty share gains for both periods. In Mainland China, the premium and luxury segments of prestige skincare are booming. In fact, luxury is the primary growth driver for the total category. For this, La Mer is ideally positioned with its heritage, iconic ingredients and superior quality. La Mer is helping to grow the category and the brand shares of prestige skincare is expanding significantly, which is the idea of combination. Desire for our luxury and artisanal fragrances is strong in the region, and we continue to see the growth. In the fourth quarter, we launched Kilian and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle in Mainland China with great initial interest from consumers. In Korea, our fragrance sales soared as Jo Malone London and Tom Ford, grew with our launches of Kilian and Le Labo were also highly sold, collectively driving prestige share gains in the category. With air travels still largely curtailed, we are focused on meeting demand locally across the brick-and-mortar and online channels, as well as in localized destinations of travel retail. Hainan, in particular is prospering as tourists gradually resumes, which partially offset the decline of travel retail in the fourth quarter. As of July, duty-free shopping allowances in Hainan have increased more than three fold, which is further boosting consumption. We continue to strengthen our leadership in the travel retail channel. Innovation is fundamental to our strategy. And even in this unique year, it once a year represented over 25% of sales. It will play a vital role in fiscal year 2021, powering the engines of the moment and the engines of the future. Already out these months are two big launches in skincare. La Mer launched its new concentrate as a potent barrier serum newly advanced with antioxidant power to be a double source of strength against environmental stressors and their aging effects. Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced the breakthrough new generation of its brand icon, Advanced Night Repair. This powerhouse serum still has all the benefits and texture loyal consumers know and love, and now feature innovative new technology. Tested on women of all skin tones, ethnicities, and ages, it now offer the fast growing highly desired benefits of firmness, pore minimization and eight hour antioxidant power on top of its existing wrinkle and uneven skin tone benefits to recruit a younger consumer, while retaining our loyal users globally. Its package is being modernized into a luxurious, recyclable glass bottle that supports our sustainability initiatives. We have excited launches to come from MAC and Clinique in makeup as we anticipate trends on the horizon. Our pipeline in fragrances and hair care is also robust with newness from Jo Malone London and Aveda, among others. Looking ahead, we are confident that we can return to our long-term growth algorithm of 6% to 8% sales growth, 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double digit earnings per share growth in constant currency after a period of normalization as the impacts of COVID-19 subside. Our citizenship and sustainability goals remains on track. We are also implementing sustainable office practices in mainland China and exploring green energy solutions there. For fiscal year 2021, we are investing in several strategic priorities intended to drive our long-term sustainable growth. Among the priorities are enhancing manufacturing capabilities, expanding online fulfillment capabilities and further funding growth opportunity in Asia Pacific, including our new state-of-art innovation center in Shanghai. While the world continues to confront many unknowns related to the pandemic, certain realities have emerged that have accelerated our strategy. As online has quickly grown, we need to more aggressively adjust our brick-and-mortar footprint and more closely align with how and where the consumer wants to shop. The post COVID business acceleration program we announced to-date is designed to rapidly relocate our resources, enabling us to invest in the greatest opportunities for long-term sustainable growth, like online, skincare, or China. Importantly, this program would also improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building brick-and-mortar footprint and better position us to make it experiential and omnichannel. Tracey will discuss the program in more detail. In closing, we confidentially bring the strength of the first half and the learnings from the second half with us into a new fiscal year. I want to thank all our employees for your exceptional contributions across the year and most especially the second half, you navigated through an unprecedented period with grace and made us a better company. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello everyone. As Fabrizio said, fiscal 2020 was an extreme tale of two halves. At the end of December, we delivered our best half year performance on record. And by the time we closed the year on June 30th, COVID-19 had created the backdrop for our worst second half [performance]. Navigating through this year has certainly been one of the most significant challenges we have faced. Same time we are proud to recognize the incredible compassion and resilience of our employees who continue to support their communities and each other as they also work to both mitigate the business impact of COVID-19 and also drive the recovery of our growth. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call, and that sales growth numbers are in constant currency. And now for the quarter results. Net sales for the fourth quarter fell 31%, as the majority of our brick and mortar distribution throughout the world was closed for much of the quarter. We rapidly accelerated programs to capture additional growth globally online, resulting in nearly double our online sales year-over-year. As a result, online sales including Retailer.com represented more than 40% of our total sales in the quarter. The December acquisition of Dr. Jart added approximately 3 points to net sales growth. Regarding our regional performance, net sales in Asia-Pacific rose 16%, driven primarily by very strong double digit growth in skincare. Mainland China returned to previous levels of robust double digit growth as brick and mortar retail reopened and online more than doubled on strong 618 midyear shopping festival programs. Nearly every brand and channel rose strong double digits in China. Korea rose mid-single digits while other markets in the region have been slower to recover. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions fell 39% with all markets declining. Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in EMEA, was hard hit by the 97% drop in international passenger traffic but still managed to decline less than 30% for the quarter supported by strong local tourism within China. Net sales in the Americas declined 54%, reflecting a very difficult environment throughout the region. From a category standpoint, skincare was the most resilient. Net sales grew 3%, driven by continued strong increases from the Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands in Asia. Skincare sales also benefited from the acquisition of the Dr. Jart brand. Net sales in makeup fell 61%, reflecting the greatest impact of COVID-19 work from home and social distancing guidelines on consumer preferences, particularly in Western markets where makeup is the largest category. Fragrance net sales declined 56%, reflecting the impact of store closures and a shift in consumer preferences from personal colognes to hand wash and home fragrances. Our hair care net sales fell 35%. Most stores and salons were shuttered during the quarter. Our gross margin decreased 840 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year as we expected. A number of factors contributed to the decline and most were triggered by the impact of COVID-19 on our sales and on our manufacturing locations. Increased obsolescence contributed more than half of the decline as demand for all products, particularly makeup was sharply curtailed by COVID-19. Inefficiencies caused by the temporary shutdown in some of our manufacturing locations and the implementation of social distancing measures reduced capacity and triggered a requirement to recognize these manufacturing costs in the current period rather than when the product is sold. This contributed approximately 210 basis points to the decline. The inventory step up related to the Dr. Jart acquisition increased tariffs and other supply chain impacts made up the remainder of the decline. Operating expenses declined 22%, reflecting the $550 million in cost actions we implemented during the quarter. However, the sudden and dramatic sales decline and the gross margin impacts I just mentioned, resulted in a $228 million operating loss for the quarter. The diluted loss per share of $0.53, including $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.06 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. Let me now discuss a few elements of our full year results. Net sales declined 3% in constant currency, reflecting the record performance in the first half, followed by the impact of COVID-19 on the second half. Our distribution mix shift continue to evolve, accelerated by COVID-19. Online sales growth accelerated during the year and continue to outpace other channels. Online, including retailer.com, represented 22% of our total sales during fiscal 2020, a 7 point increase compared to last year. Travel retail delivered strong performance despite the sharp downturn in the second half, and grew high single digits for the year, ending fiscal 2020 at 25% of sales. Department stores globally, including their retailer.com business, represented 31% of fiscal 2020 sales. And North America department stores were 9% of our global sales mix. Our gross margin fell 220 basis points to 75.2%, driven largely by the factors I just described in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the increase in obsolescence comprised about half of the decline. The COVID related manufacturing efficiencies were approximately 50 basis points, and the Dr. Jart acquisition increased tariffs and other supply chain impacts caused the remainder of the decrease. Operating expenses declined $240 million or 3% for the year, reflecting savings from Leading Beauty Forward and our ongoing costs initiatives, as well as the cost containment actions we took in response to COVID-19 in the second half of the fiscal year. Our full year operating margin fell 280 basis points to 14.7%, primarily reflecting the gross margin decline, 40 basis points dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart and the deleveraging effect of lower sales. The capabilities we built during this time and the actions we took and are taking should help position us to emerge strongly when the recovery is in full swing. Our effective tax rate for the year was 23.2%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings. Net earnings declined 24% to $1.5 billion and diluted EPS fell 23% to $4.12. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.04 from currency translation and $0.11 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. We recorded $1.2 billion after tax or $3.31 per share of impairment charges, primarily related to our makeup brands that were initially challenged by a general slowdown in the overall makeup category and along with certain freestanding retail stores have been further challenged by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand. In fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $68 million after-tax, or $0.19 per share in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We remain on track to substantially complete initiatives under the program by the end of fiscal 2021, and we continue to expect annual net benefits of approximately $475 million before taxes. These charges were partially offset by the gain on our minority interest in Dr. Jart and favorable changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. As you have heard, COVID-19 has created a number of disruptions to our business, including accelerating changes in our distribution mix that had been expected to occur over a longer period of time. The post-COVID business acceleration program that we announced today reflects the need to accelerate additional organizational changes during fiscal 2021 to operate more effectively in the post-COVID reality. We expect to close select department store counters and between 10% to 15% of freestanding retail stores, primarily in Europe and North America, while also further supporting the accelerating consumer shift to online shopping. This necessitates commensurate changes in our commercial organizations that will reduce the number of employees by a net range of 1,500 to 2,000, primarily point of sale and support personnel related to those retail locations. While some positions will necessarily be eliminated, we also plan to increase investment in online talent and capabilities, including online consultation by sales associates. We also intend to reinvest a portion of the savings from the program to further build out our online technical capabilities, including accelerating omnichannel capabilities linked to our retail stores and to increase digital media to reach both new and existing consumers. The program is beginning now and we expect to realize results fairly quickly, mostly in the coming two years. We expect to take charges of between $400 million and $500 million through fiscal 2022 and generate savings of $300 million to $400 million before tax by fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested to drive growth. Moving on to cash flows. Cash generated from operations was slightly below last year at $2.3 billion, reflecting lower net sales, partially offset by call to actions and favorable working capital. We utilized $623 million for capital improvements, primarily supporting our ecommerce capabilities, supply chain improvements and information technology. We eliminated or deferred approximately one third of our planned CapEx, mostly related to retail stores and office space upgrades. We also used $1.04 billion net of cash required to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Dr. Jart. During the year, we borrowed $2.7 billion net of repayments to both fund the acquisition of Dr. Jart and to provide liquidity and flexibility as the COVID-19 impact spread during the second half of the year. We ended the year with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $6.1 billion in short and long term debt. Even with these liquidity actions and with lower earnings, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to stockholders during the year via dividends and share repurchase activity. In August, we repaid the remaining outstanding $750 million drawn on our revolver. In the near-term, while we are encouraged by the gradual reopening of markets around the world, it remains difficult to predict the duration of the pandemic, the timing and trajectory of the recovery and the corresponding impact on our business, even while online remains a significant bright spot. Where stores are open, we are seeing traffic return slowly. We are also mindful of the risk of the global recession and a likely slow recovery in employment, as some businesses in Western markets remain closed and many government support measures taper off. Therefore, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the full year. However, we can provide you with some underlying assumptions to help at least frame some of your expectations for the year. We do expect to see progressive quarterly sales and profit improvement as retail doors reopen and traffic and travel gradually resumes, assuming no significant second wave occurs. Given this expectation, for the first half of the fiscal year, comparisons to our record performance in the prior first half will be difficult with sales and profit below prior year levels. While online is expected to perform strongly, the momentum for recovery in brick-and-mortar and travel retail will not be realized until later in the second half. Conversely, we expect sales and profit to grow significantly in the second half of the year against a period of considerable COVID impact, particularly in the fourth quarter. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart should add about 1 to 2 percentage points to sales growth for the fiscal year. Pricing is expected to add another 2 points of growth. Our manufacturing capacity is back to near normal levels and we expect our gross margin to recover accordingly. We expect to realize the full benefit from Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2021, and we will continue to maintain some of the COVID-19 cost controls as we progress through the first half of the year. These savings are expected to give us the flexibility to invest more in digital marketing and advertising to support innovation, recruit new consumers and drive brand awareness, while also supporting our operating margin recovery. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $170 million. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $900 million as we continue to invest in additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, technology and data analytics, research capabilities and ecommerce to support future growth. And as you saw in press release today, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. We also expect to reinstate share repurchases sometime during the year as we gain comfort that the recovery is more sustained. As we are all already halfway through our first quarter, we are more comfortable providing guidance for this quarter. At this time, we expect sales to decline 11% to 12% in constant currency. Sales declines peaked in April and have been gradually improving each month as retail markets around the world reopened for business. The incremental sales from Dr. Jart are expected to add about 2.5 points to growth and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 1 point. We expect first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85, reflecting the sales outlook, continued cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas like online, innovation and China. Currency is expect to dilute EPS by $0.01 and Dr. Jart is forecast to dilute EPS by $0.06. We look forward to leveraging the tremendous strengths of our business and driving a strong recovery in the new fiscal year as the market accommodates. Protecting our agility to invest appropriately for both the near term recovery and the long-term opportunities inherent in global prestige beauty is paramount to the strategic actions we are taking to continue to support long-term sustainable growth. On behalf of Fabrizio and The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's leadership team, we give thanks to all of our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : I guess my question is for Fabrizio. You've had a lot of success in digital that was really expounded upon this quarter. Have you changed your views on how you view Amazon as a potential beauty partner? And then secondly, as stores are starting to reopen. Can you just talk about how consumers are interacting with stores? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So, not yet. We have not changed our point of view at this point of time on Amazon. We see such a huge long-term sustainable evolution of our online that we want to focus on that. And specifically, I want to explain what's happening online. Our last quarter, our online business was growing at double digits and these included 90% growth on our brand.com. Great work on Retail.com in the 80% plus and also triple digit in our platforms are likely more. This increase, particularly the Brand.com and the platforms is increasing our direct to consumer business, which means increasing our data availability of consumers and increasing our ability to market these consumers. The other thing we are seeing is a dramatic increase in consumer engagement in the world of online. And because of these better engagements, we are driving loyalty and repeat of our hero products like never before. And finally, we really see an increase of exclusivity, meaning the consumers that were really there are buying more exclusively our brands and our brands online. And we see the arrival of new consumers across all age groups, which was not the case in the past where the younger age group was ahead. And now we see really an increase across all ages group. This is a tremendous opportunity and we will stay focused on leveraging this opportunity in the future. The other thing we are doing is investing in creating better omnichannel capability, which brings you -- bridge to your second part of the question, which is what we see in store. We see that brick-and-mortar stores are and will remain very important. But they will need to be linked more whenever possible in omnichannel ways to the online, the consumer expect the full experience and the brick-and-mortar store will need to become even more experiential to attract the right traffic on top of being omnichannel. And so we expect brick-and-mortar to be very important, continue being brand building, but we need as we explained in the prepared remarks to rationalize it, because we need to increase productivity. We need to bring back the productivity level that have been diminished by the COVID situation. And bringing back the productivity will make the brick-and-mortar more sustainable for the long-term and we continue to be an essential part of brand building. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was hoping we could talk a little bit about North America and sort of underlying brand\u2019s performance and takeaway, if you will, there. So I think anything you could share I guess one in terms of brand.com performance and then two, the degree to which existing retail inventory, so retail inventory at department stores, as an example and specialty multi, which are redirected to fulfill online orders, such that maybe the shipment numbers that you're recording don't really give us like a full read of how the brands were actually performing during the quarter? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. So, first of all, your first part of the equation in North America our online business has been exceptionally strong, and our brand.com business has been really exceptionally strong. And the penetration of the online business has increased dramatically up to the 40% and so that\u2019s changed. Now a lot of this will be sustainable for the reason I was explaining before. Meaning that retail.com is increasing and there are reason why it would be sustainable, the engagement of the consumers there is increasing. Our brand.com increase in the 90% is sustainable, because we see it from the consumer engagement for the amount of time people spend on our brand.com just to give you a sense, a few data points that the virtual try on that we have added, or the chat with consultants that we have added, or the entertainment activities that we have added in the story explanation of innovation, all of these brought in some brands, and Est\u00e9e Lauder as an example. We have consumer that spent 26 minutes of our site interacting with us. So we see real time of interaction, the time of engagement going-up. So this is -- will make this very sustainable growth over the long-term. And joined with our new technologies will make it probably one of the best consumer experiences overtime in luxury consumer experience, full of experience and our omnichannel capabilities. So that's what's happened now. To be clear, this was in our plans. This was part of our compass. But the COVID-19 has anticipated these trends and the speed of marching of these trends of at least two three years that\u2019s what we have seen. Now, the impact of COVID-19 outbreak, however, is also expected to disrupt the brick and mortar in the near term, is in fact include the store closure in the parent stores, which are happening obviously in the quarter -- last quarter they were closed. In many, many cases, the closure directed by us will also be added in the future as we explained in the post COVID-19 acceleration program. And then we are conscious of the highest level of unemployment and that is affecting consumer sentiment, in total, in general. And we see also these affecting particularly for the time being the make up category. We are managing through this, pivoting towards the online business as I explained, supporting also -- supported by our new understand -- granual understanding of consumer and the biggest availability to data that we can drive and in our post-COVID business acceleration program will, however, accelerate the increased productivity in our freestanding store, in our department stores and should work really to rapidly bring productivity back in the future. Fewer brick and mortar location, which is what's happening there. Now in the short term but also will continue in the medium term will reduce our fixed cost and should have also making the region becoming more profitable with the different mix between online and brick and mortar. Tracey Travis : And the only thing I'll add Lauren is the brand.com business in North America in the fourth quarter was up almost 70%, and represented about 60% of the mix of business. So it was a very strong performer, as you might well imagine and that to Fabrizio\u2019s point was the case really across all of our markets. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Just a quick clarification. Can you confirm that online margins are [accretive] to the corporate average level? Just clarification. And then Tracey, Fabrizio, I mean, how do we think about this post COVID plan and kind of what you're targeting for like online as a percentage of the overall 7 point increase is quite dramatic. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the evolution over the 24 month period over this program? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : I don't know. I can say our online margins are stronger than average. So the development of our online business is accretive to the business that is a fact. And how we are thinking of this? I mean, we are thinking of the continuous growth of the penetration of online in our business. I'm not going to give you a specific number, because there's a lot, has to be written in the future. But as a point of reference, we have today at the level of 40% in the most developed online markets in the world, US, UK, China, and other markets are growing tremendously from a much lower base than these three markets. But in every market, there is a tremendous growth. So the potential is very high. And we will learn more about what this specific landing point could be, but it\u2019s going to be significantly higher than today. Tracey Travis : So we finished the fiscal year \u201820 at at a 22% online mix, as we said in our prepared remarks. And we would expect online penetration to grow from there, even with the strong growth in the fourth quarter, obviously, with a lot of our brick-and-mortar closed during much of the quarter. We do still expect the higher penetration in fiscal '21 of online on top of what we saw in full year on fiscal '20 with a portion of our brick-and-mortar doors closed. So to Fabrizio's point, the acceleration of online that we are prepared to continue to sustain with all of the programs that we implemented in Q4 and expect to continue along with other capabilities that we're adding in fiscal '21, should continue to sustain a lot of those consumers that perhaps discovered shopping online for the first time, or at least certainly was our record of them for the first time and they continued that practice. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask, so your growth in calendar first half '20 was slightly above what estimated market share for prestige look like, at least estimated by one of your larger peers but also then slightly below the growth from that larger peer, which has been somewhat consistent in recent years. I guess, perhaps talk a bit about the dynamics of that and how you anticipate share trends to progress kind of through your fiscal '21, maybe segment geography and kind of what perhaps has driven some of that under performance like you anticipate for the future and kind of maybe, if we're all wrong, kind of looking at that point that out as well. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : I'm not sure I understood completely the way you frame the question. But basically, we are growing global market share and we are in prestige, our -- the global market leader. And the total market share is growing and is growing ahead of our competition in general a global level, because we are focusing on the area of fastest growth and most importantly, we are focusing on the areas of profitable, sustainable long-term growth. And because of this, the total is growth. Now there are areas of the business where because of our historical business model, we are losing market share. In some cases also, we're losing more market share than some of our competitors and those are -- this is specific to the U.S., for example, is an example of this. But there are areas like China, travel retail, Asia, in general, where we are growing and we are growing very fast. So our strategy is not to add our multiple engines of growth to grow all at the same time at any cost. We are trying to put the resources. We have located resources, where there is the highest sustainability and better returns. And in that sense, we really look at the key measure of the global market share. And so that\u2019s answer part of your question. The other part of the equation, how we see this market share develop by quarter. As we explained in our prepared remarks, we see really a gradual improvement of our business quarter-by-quarter during fiscal year '21. We explained, which is our view of the first quarter, the second quarter will be better and the last semester will be really strong. And that's our view of the recovery and this is a reflection of the way the stores will reopen, COVID will hopefully be managed around the world and the market, particularly the consumer sentiment in different part of the world will be reestablished. Where the consumer sentiment is reestablished? Where COVID has allowed the reopening in most of the channels like China, we are seeing tremendous business and tremendous share gain. So is also in the area of consumption in market share was the core of your question. We see a gradual acceleration and recovery over the years in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Tracey, maybe you want to add some perspective. Tracey Travis : No. And obviously, we have not provided guidance for the year for obvious reasons, as we don't know how the recovery will progress or COVID-19 will impact global markets for the fiscal year. But as we think about the second half of the year, because I know we tried to provide you with as much as we were comfortable providing as it relates to the guidance. But if you think about the second half of the year comparable, assuming that there is a gradual recovery and there's no other shock to the system, very comparable to our fiscal 2019 EPS performance. So stronger sales growth, but comparable to our fiscal '19 EPS growth. And that's with obviously the tax rate and the interest expense call outs that I made. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : The first question is on the stores that you will keep open. Can you give us some sense of what that footprint will look like maybe by brand and by geography. And I know those stores, even though they\u2019ve been, the ones that you're closing, they may have been unproductive, but they still have served as great ways to build customer relationships. And they're great branding vehicles and all that kind of good stuff. So how much of the savings from closing those stores do you intend to drop to the bottom line versus reinvest to offset the benefit of that branding presence, if you will, that you had historically? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Let me start and then Tracey may add some. First of all, we are doing what the consumers are telling us they want. So we are following the consumer preferences evolution. And second, we are responding to the decisions of our retail partners, because to be clear there are retailers which are using the number of stores, there are retailers which are closing. And so first of all, we need to reflect what is the reality of the market. Second, we need to reflect what the consumer preferences are. And these will result in closing the stores, which are the least productive. And so the stores that will remain, which is obviously the large majority, these stores would be more productive and will allow us to make these store experiential and in the appropriate cases also multichannel. And these will make these stores not only sustainable for the long-term but will make these stores brand building. While the non-productive stores, which are not working and there is no traffic, frankly, are losing their power of being branded business. But the large majority of the remaining brick and mortar will remain -- will be more productive and will be a fantastic brand building tool that will continue to create the relationships that we have experienced. But the unproductive stores of the world are frankly not very productive relationship to date. And on the contrary, the online, new way to work and particularly the new way of the consumer to engage online, is becoming much more relationship building, much more brand building than ever before. And I think if I had to summarize what is in my opinion the biggest change of COVID-19 that made all the online channel, brand.com, platforms, pure plays, retailer.com, much more brand engaging and so much more fully luxury experiences, thanks to technology than ever before. And so to last part of your question, the savings from these productivity improvement in brick and mortar will be in fact obviously, going to the bottom line but in fact will be invested and will be invested in making the remaining brick-and-mortar store and our online much more brand building, growing faster and continue to create outstanding relationship with our consumers. Now to underestimate the fact that a lot of the strong online growth is in brand.com and platforms. So where we have the data access will also give us much more information, data insights, to manage the consumers and the business better in the future. Tracey Travis : And the only thing I'll add to that is most of our stores are profitable. We have had a portion of our stores as you have heard us talk about the mix shift we've experienced over the last few years. Some of our stores became more marginally profitable and obviously, COVID-19 accelerated some of them into a loss. As we think about recovery and what to expect in terms of brick-and-mortar recovery, those are stores that now we believe need to close. And as you all know, the deleverage related to some of the fixed costs of freestanding stores when they are not productive is burdensome. And certainly prevents us from being able to invest behind recruiting new consumers from a digital marketing perspective. So those are the stores that we will be taking action on. They were -- on that marginal bubble to begin with and certainly has become loss making now that and we don't expect them to recover from loss making. As it relates to our mix of stores you can imagine as well, clearly, in the more mature markets, like North America and Europe, those are where the bulk of the stores are that we will be addressing. And with the challenges in the makeup category, a number of them are in the makeup area. But they're not just makeup, they do comprise some other locations as well, where mall productivity has declined and/or street productivity has declined but some are freestanding stores. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : So I guess as we met all of that together and fast forward to when your sales do recover to pre-COVID levels. Is it your expectation standing here today that the resulting profitability in margin against those sales will be higher than before just given the productivity and restructuring efforts, and the mix shifts that we're talking about the online and skincare? Or are there reasons to believe that that maybe delayed, given the growth reinvestments you just spoke about and maybe some residual weakness in higher margin channels like travel? I guess, little bit more color as to how you're thinking about all that? Tracey Travis : So and obviously margin, we don't expect will recover this year. And certainly with the actions that we're taking, we would hope that we could recover back to fiscal \u201819 margins by next fiscal year. But that is just the pattern as we believe in fiscal \u201822 again, all things going smoothly, which has not been the case for last several years. But that in fiscal \u201822 assuming a normal year, we will be back to the margins that we had pre-COVID and would progress from there, as Fabrizio indicated in his prepared remarks, to back to our 6% to 8% top line growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So on the makeup category, I was curious just to get your perspective in terms of how you guys think the makeup recovery could take place from here? And then also, I guess related to that question. I know obsolescence related to makeup was a big headwind on the gross margin line in Q4. So I was just curious whether that headwind would continue into this fiscal year? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So I'll answer the second portion of that question. We clearly adjusted our demand plans and our forecast to be more in line with the trends that we're seeing in makeup this year, even in the recovery. One of the things that we have seen during COVID-19, there has been even an acceleration from a penetration standpoint of interest in skincare and we certainly expect that to continue next year. We have some great innovation programs behind our makeup brands as well. But we are adjusting our forecast to the level of consumption we expect coming out of fiscal \u201820 and the ramp up through fiscal fiscal \u201821. So we certainly don't expect to see the same level of obsolescence unless there is another complete shutdown of business, we don't expect to see the same level of obsolescence in fiscal \u201821. And then Fabrizio? Fabrizio Freda : And to the question of when makeup recover. Absolutely, makeup is a category, is coming back. This is -- what we are seeing is the impact of what COVID has created on the consumer sentiment or consumer behaviors, is the result of wearing masks in many parts of the world, which has an impact of lipstick, the result of being in homes and having less interaction and less social interaction between people. And there is also frankly the stress that causes and the situation today in many parts of the world is creating that is conducive, it\u2019d be less to the use of makeup that again is part of the joyful moments and individual moments, more than anything else. And so we expect this to come back, and to come back now, this is now into point of views. From my point of view, the makeup cycle will come back very strongly as soon as consumer sentiment will be back and obviously will be back in the future. We'll see this category booming again and we'll be ready for that. That's exactly the essence of the multiple engines of growth that in this moment is skincare, and there is reason why is skincare. Somebody was asking me if the lipstick index is finished. You all remember the lipstick index concept was that beauty is a resilient category, both in situation of crisis like this one and in particular situation of recession risk, because they are affordable purchases for indulging and taking care of yourself. And consumer really love their routines. Now this has remain exactly true also in this crisis. What has changed is the category, because of COVID is, lipstick was not the right category to indicate that but the resiliency of the overall beauty is still evident and is still vary from market. But the way I answer is the lipstick index has been substituted by the most rising index but the concept of index is still there. This is a very resilient category and makeup will come back when consumer sentiment will come back. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Steph Wissink : Our question relates to trial and discovery. I think, Tracey, you mentioned you have some new launches planned and also, Fabrizio, you talked about some of the emerging technologies, live streaming, virtual try-on that you're using in your online business. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about trial and discovery going forward, whether it's makeup or skincare, and then also just intertwining your comments on data, customer data and data access? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : First of all, trial and discovery is going very well. And what is evolving and continue to be very strong is obviously trial and discovery in store is always has always been the key point, and what is evolving in trial and discovery online. And the way this is happening is, first of all, we see and I said this before, we see consumer spending much more time. So the level of engagement, the level of relationship with our online sites is increasing. They spend time and they spend time to discover. Now in terms of trial, we are making a very big new investments in sampling online. So you will go and buy online, for example, now at brand.com, your preferred hero products and then you will receive the samples of what our data suggests that you may like around that when you open your pack at home. And in this way, we see how we are driving trial. We are driving discovery, frankly, stronger than what we've ever been able to do in stores, because the ability to know what people will like based on data together with the ability to interact with people with more time in the online relationship, and to shift to their home, their main purchases allow us to make them try a discover, everything else is just a matter of the techniques that we choose. So this is the moment where I believe trial and discovery can be further enhanced in the luxury business model that we are developing for our future. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : I would rather ask you a long-term question, but I want you to clarify one thing that Tracey mentioned. Tracey, I think you said the second half of the year earnings performance will be the same as fiscal second half of '19. And then I think later you said EPS growth would be comparable to fiscal '19. Maybe you could clarify that as I just look back at the model you did about $2.09 in EPS in the second half of '19? I think everybody is probably going to hook models to that comment. So it would help to get a little clarification there. And then I guess, and I do hate to be near term, but it seems like in the first quarter guidance bakes in about 800 basis points of an operating margin contraction. I think you said the gross margin should start to improve. And obviously, with the factories open, you'll see less of the accounting drag there from idle factory overhead accruals. I know, the stores are reopening but the SG&A was down by $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter. It seems like it should still be meaningfully lower year-over-year, even if retail starts to come back online. So I just want to make sure I understand where the pressure is on the margin might be in the first quarter related to what you guided? Tracey Travis : So let me start with -- again, reiterating the fact we are not giving guidance. So as we try to help you frame the your model for the year, given the fact we're not giving guidance. One of the things to think about as we believe that the second half of the year, we will still be recovering our sales growth but will be more normalized assuming no additional impacts from COVID-19. The way you could think about our second half EPS is similar to our adjusted fiscal '19 EPS in the second half. Again, with the ramp up and acceleration in sales that we expect to see. So that is a way to kind of think about the second half. But again, that depends obviously on a continuation of progress as it relates to the recovery. As it relates to the first quarter, what we said in our prepared remarks is we do expect gross margin to recover. And so when you think about the margin for Q1, one of the things we are doing is investing in advertising. So even with sales down in the quarter, we have a launch of our -- one of our most popular products, Advanced Night Repair and that is, we are supporting with digital advertising, some of the online initiatives as well. We are supporting with additional advertising and other innovation as well. So that is a piece of what's driving some margin deleverage in the first quarter. The other piece is higher shipping costs. So we are still catching up a bit from our plants starting up more slowly as it relates to social distancing, but now ramped up but really catching up on some of the shipping to replenish some of the product that was low on inventory in certain markets. So that is driving a piece of the margin. And then when you think about EPS, we obviously have higher net interest expense. So we have higher interest expense and we have lower interest income, given where rates are today. So the combination of that is also putting some pressure on our EPS in the first quarter. And then the last piece obviously, as I did quote the tax rate, which would be the tax rate we expect to see in the first quarter as well. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Fabrizio, Tracey, can you help me understand the travel retail performance embedded in the first quarter guidance, now that you have more than half of your quarter through? And just a clarification on those puts and takes that Tracey you just described for the first quarter. So basically, your team is through a lot of the pressures that we saw in the quarter. So if you can help us understand the exit rates on some of these expenses that would great, but the travel would be my first -- my main question? Tracey Travis : So, I'll start and then let Fabrizio share his perspective on travel retail. There are still travel restrictions. So travel retail is still largely closed in the first quarter. And again, we expect travel retail really to be the slowest to recover. Now again, we are seeing traffic locally in Asia, in particular in China and so that is continuing to pick up. And as Fabrizio addressed some event in his prepared remarks, but we do expect that travel retail will be the slowest to recover. As it relates, again, to the to the first quarter. Relative to the fourth quarter, I guess we'll all add to what I\u2019ve said just previously. We did have some furlough programs in the fourth quarter that also are not repeating in the first quarter. So that is another piece of why the expenses, if you're comparing the fourth quarter to the first quarter, might look a bit higher. So it's the advertising, it's the shipping cost. And we do have some of the furlough programs that we had in the fourth quarter that will not be repeating. Probably for -- when you look at the quarter, and more comparable quarter would be the third quarter of last year relative to our first quarter this year in terms of overall performance. Fabrizio Freda : And what I will add on travel retail is that, first of all, in the long-term, we believe travel retail will continue to be a very exciting channel. And in this moment, the traffic is at very low. But for example, the conversion of travelers into buyers is increasing dramatically. The Asia is the biggest path to a travel retail globally. And the good news that Asia is going to recover faster than the West, the traveling traffic and the conversion driven by retail. So basically by travel retail online in Asia even stronger saying the rest of the world. So the good news that will overtime mitigate the current lack of traffic in travel retail is that the recovery is starting from Asia, Asia is the biggest and the most interesting travel retail segment. The other important thing to say in travel retail is that in this moment, the number of travel retail also in the last quarter and minus 30% has been better than at least we were afraid of, because of the many closures around the world. And the reason why it's been better, there are some mitigating factors, which are very important. The most important mitigating factor is that -- has been the start of China local internal travel that in many cases is beautifully traveled, like in the Hainan Island And the extraordinary increase of what the Chinese are buying within their local duty free travel is mitigating the lack of very limited international travel. But then you can expect for the long-term when the international travel will be reinstated, these local internal travel will not go away. And so there will be a stronger and even more exciting long term travel retail market to manage in which we are today the market leader. And so there is a lot of long term potential into that and I'm very exciting to see what's happening in Hainan, particularly for the future. Tracey Travis : And the only thing I will add in terms of quarter four versus quarter one, obviously, being down 30% in sales in Q4 and progressing to down 11% to 12% in Q1. We are seeing obviously a pick up in our brick and mortar business. And so in July in fact, as Fabrizio indicated, we actually had positive sales growth. And that was related to some of the restocking that we saw in the trade for doors that had been closed and are now reopening. So we are seeing positive signs that we will expect to continue to see throughout the first half, even as brick and mortar recovers more slowly than obviously the strength we're seeing continue in online. Operator : And we have time for one more question. The final question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : First, just a follow-up. Did you just say that July was positive overall or specific to a channel? And then just generally speaking, I wanted to ask about the balance between containing costs and supporting the top line, because it's clear that your investments resonated in the top line in the last couple of years pre-pandemic. So as we think about the timing of you getting back on your long term algorithm clearly with a focus on efficiency. Can you talk about how the organization plans to balance achieving both of those things concurrently? Thanks. Tracey Travis : So my comment on July was global and it was sales growth. And a lot of that being driven from North America actually in terms of some of the restocking within North America, and still seeing growth obviously in markets like China and Korea, the same markets that had momentum in the fourth quarter or more momentum. But every market is improving a bit as doors reopen and we start to see traffic flow back to stores. But July really was restocking from many of our retailers that had their doors closed, and we're sourcing some of their online sales from their brick and mortar doors. Fabrizio Freda : In terms of -- so yes, July was positive to the company. But to speak about your second part of the question is the focus on the top line, and we intent to remain a high growth company. So we are really focused on growth but we are focused on profitable growth. And in the short term, we are -- we\u2019ll remain focused cost containment to make sure that we preserve the resources to invest in growth. So the cost containment in our program is never shorter, is always designed to preserve and reallocate resources for investment in long term growth and obviously, to drive profitability at the right level. So that's the way we think about it. And in our compass and our strategic process are very focused in identifying the key areas of growth and the key areas of sustainable profitable growth, and to invest in them over proportionally, and to continuously reallocate resources in these areas, that's what we're talking. And also our refractory program is also designed to give us the flexibility to continue doing that also in the COVID situation despite that we are paying a lot of attention to mitigate the short-term impact of lack of sales with a lot of good action of cost containment. We are really focused on recovery, that\u2019s the key point, is recovery of our top-line that overtime gradually will bring back our profitability and our ability to continue to deliver the kind of EPS and double digit EPS growth that we want want to deliver in the long-term. I'd also would like to close, if this is last question, saying in this COVID crisis, as we try to in every crisis, I truly believe, we are coming out as a better company. And yes, we're focused on the profitability side. This company can go back to being high growth and being high growth with strong profitability, but also is a better company in inclusion, in sustainability, in technology. And all of these together will make us also better employer and stronger loyalty, both of employees and of Europe. And I think that's very important value for the company we are, which our company -- very long-term focus. And I think this crisis has been managing in a way where we remain as long-term focused company and we\u2019ll remain a better company, we\u2019ll be a better company.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's Fiscal 2021 First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Rainey Mancini : Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through Brand.com and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailer\u2019s websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. I hope that each of you are in good health, as the world continues to confront COVID-19. Our hearts are with those impacted and our focus remains first and foremost, with the safety and well-being of our employees, their families, and our consumers. I continue to be incredibly inspired by our employees' enduring compassion, creativity, and resiliency, you are making us a better company, and I stand my deepest gratitude. Our diversified prestige beauty portfolio of categories, channels, geographies, brands, consumers segments, and price points give us many levers to fuel the business, both in times of prosperity as well as during more challenging times. In this most difficult moment, our multiple engines of growth strategy is invaluable. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, sales declined only 9%, a significant sequential improvement, driven by every category. Fragrance and healthcare in particular, had striking progress. Our hero products and innovations thrived and contributed meaningfully to sales. We successfully adjusted our cost structure to minimize the leveraging effects of lower sales, resulting in an operating margin of 20%, very close to the first quarter of last year, when we had double-digit sales growth. In different periods over the last decade, we were driven by different engines, leading to prestige beauty share gains each year and we expect this year to be no different. Since the pandemic began, we estimate that we have grown prestige beauty share globally. On our last earning call, we explained that the growth engines at the moment are the skincare category, the online channel in, Asia-Pacific regions, each delivered terrific performance to begin our new fiscal year. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand performed exceptionally well, returning to growth in the quarter powered by its hero franchises in skincare. Its Advanced Night Repair franchise delivered very strong double-digit sales growth. Encouragingly, the brand success in skincare was broad based as each of the Re-Nutriv, Revitalizing Supreme, Perfectionist, Micro Essence, nutritious franchises also grew double-digits. This is a remarkable achievement when compared to the brand's very strong skincare performance in the prior year. La Mer had a superb quarter with double-digit sales growth globally, driven by its continued outperformance of luxury skincare growth in Mainland China. The August launch of its new The Concentrate delivered especially strong double-digit sales growth in Asia -- in Asia-Pacific and consumer saw the shooting power of this barrier serum with its new protective antioxidant benefits. Even amidst the pandemic La Mer is welcoming many new consumers, farther demonstrating the irritable appeals of the brand's superior quality. At our last Investor Day, we discussed growth strategies for each of our large, scaling, and developing brands. And even in these challenging times, we are resolute in our focus on all three tiers. The Darphin brand is a beautiful example in the developing tier of a brand succeeding through these perilous times. Darphin contributed to the skincare category growth in the quarter as the successful launch of Intral Rescue Super Concentrate serum amplify the strengths of the brand's hero products. Our acquisition of Dr. Jart with its terrific entry prestige derma brand positioning and desirable hero products enhanced the organic sales growth of skincare. Momentum in the serum watery lotion in eye care subcategories carried into the quarter deriving skincare growth. The August launch of Est\u00e9e Lauder new Advanced Night Repair serum performed extraordinary across geographies and channel aided by compelling activation and an over 40% surge in consumers' reviews since launch when comparing to the entire lifespan of the previous version. Impressively, Clinique even better Clinique interactive serum continues to perform strongly in its third quarter since launch. We deliver outstanding double-digit sales growth online, with skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care over prospering. Once again, each of our online channels contributed meaningfully. We continued to strategically invest in our brand sites globally, bringing our classic high-touch services to consumers online. The response has been phenomenal. We are seeing tremendous growth in time spent on for chat, virtual try-on, and shoppable live streams. Even with most retail doors reopen around the world, sales rose 60% organically on our brand sites. We now have virtual try-on across more brands and categories in more markets. In the first quarter alone, we hosted over 1 million virtual try-on sessions globally, with consumer spending more than 30 minutes on average in a session. In North America, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand launched AI-driven product recommendations based on real-time consumers' behaviors and past preferences. These dynamic merchandising holds great promise across our brands and regions. Clinique global sales growth on Brand.com in the quarter was exceptional among the strongest across the portfolio. Clinique Skin School, on-demand live streaming was a great success, leading to new daily programming that combines top consultants with influences to future holiday sets and favorite Clinique products. Clinique is our first brand to launch new technology that pairs multiple host in one shop about live stream. Bobbi Brown continue to scale its artistry like never before program, expanding visual artistry to include live chat, pre-booked video consultations, master classes, and live streaming by rapidly converting some of its global makeup assets into a network of virtual sellers. Most of the brands markets now offer these consultations on Brand.com, on local social platforms such as WhatsApp, WeChat, and Instagram. These virtual services have a higher conversion rate, up to 10 times the average and a higher average order value. With enticing innovation and engaging new services and tools, commercial grew -- conversion grew strong double-digits across our brand sites, most compelling is the significant conversion growth in markets that are under penetrated online, such as Continental Europe. In the quarter, conversion there grew over 75%, while in Latin America; conversion growth far exceeded 100%. These positions are well for suitable profitable growth online. We invested in online fulfillment during the quarter, strengthening our capacity globally and we are addressing seasonal fulfillment locations in our largest markets in anticipation of robust consumer demand for holiday. Leveraging our investment in technology, we deployed more omnichannel capabilities in several markets. In the U.S., we have seen dramatic uptick in buy online pick up in store format. The brands also partnered with Postmates domestically to launch same-day delivery and open a new experiential store in New York. The store features extensive personalization options for consumers and interactive digital experiences. In these initiatives and more, we are meeting the desires of consumers who are craving convenience and choice, offering them new ways to shop in today's environment. The third engines of growth, Asia-Pacific, also exceled. Several markets contributed to the region high single-digit sales growth, which is most notable as some markets in the region dealt with new waves of COVID-19. Mainland China, Korea, and several smaller markets grew organically. In Mainland China, we continue to invest in the vibrant opportunity of our second home market. We expanded into more cities in the course; reaching over 130. We increased our advertising investment across social and digital platform, showcasing exciting innovation and building brand awareness as we reach new consumers. We continued expanding our talent in anticipation of our new state-of-art innovation center, which will open in Shanghai, as we aim to best meet the needs of Chinese and Asian consumers with local relevancy and local trends, through increased capabilities in product design, formulation, consumer insights, and trend analytics. In Mainland China, the bricks-and-mortar channel returned to double-digit growth, such that both offline and online were powerful growth drivers. The travel retail channels further contributed, driven by tremendous growth in [Indiscernible], partly reflecting increased duty-free purchase limits, the opening of some travel corridors in Asia and online retail growth facilitating higher conversion, magnifying Chinese consumer strengths. Indeed demand from the Chinese consumers was very strong across these channels, most especially in skincare, and we estimate we grew our prestige beauty share. The Fragrance category sales growth accelerated in Asia-Pacific in the quarter. We introduced Kilian Paris and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle in Mainland China, in very select distribution. These unique luxurious brands are proving highly desirable, which coupled with the ongoing strengths of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford drove significant double-digit sales growth of Fragrances. In Korea, Fragrances also soared, Le Labo, new [Indiscernible] fragrances drove meaningful upside, demonstrating the strength of our locally relevant innovation. Around the world, we continue to closely monitor the evolution of consumer attitudes and purchase behavior related to COVID-19. We combine sophisticated social media listening capabilities with machine learning and properly consumer research techniques to develop insights and adapt our marketing and product offering with speed and agility to capture changing trends. Looking ahead, we are confident in the return of growth in the challenged makeup category as the recovery will unfolds. In the meantime, we continue to focus on subcategories in makeup, the favored in the era of masks for COVID-19. In fact, even in lip, which is overall pressured, the liquid lip subcategory is growing naturally driven by M\u00b7A\u00b7C of Power Kiss [ph] liquid lip as consumers sick matte finish formulas that last. Our innovation represented over 30% of sales in the first quarter. We have an exciting pipeline on new product launches for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 for both engines of moment and what we expect to be engines of the future. In October, Clinique launched Moisture Surge Intense Replenishing Hydrator, a new formula that hydrates skin for a full 72 hours in a cream gel formula that dries for drier skin types. This month La Mer will introduce its new [Indiscernible] concentrated night balm, an anti-stress balm, slow crafted with crystal miracle broth that promotes skin natural rebuilding of collagen to help transform the look of skin during sleep. Continuing our progress on sustainability, Origins intend to be the first prestige beauty brand to bring an advanced recycle tube package to market with this Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask in 2021. These expands upon Clinique recent launch of all about clean in packaging with most consumer recycled material and plan the right plastic for each tube and most consumer recycled material for its cap. For fiscal year 2021, we continue to expect sequential improvement in sales growth each quarter and to deal global share while prestige beauty progressively returned to growth. We are mindful of the ongoing inputs of COVID-19, most especially the very limited traffic in retail doors, a story open and the second waves occurring in certain markets. We are investing in several strategic priorities intended to drive our long-term sustainable growth that progressive in the word of past call the business acceleration program. For the second quarter, we have magnificent plans for holiday and the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival. Holiday merchandising began a few weeks ago and our brands created rich activations with engaging [Indiscernible] products. Est\u00e9e Lauder LML have kits that include best-selling hero process to drive recruitment. Origin is making holiday gifting easy, offering consumers the ability to text or email a gift, allowing the recipients to either accept or exchange their product before it is gift wrapped and sent to them. Bobbi Brown Holiday Wish List Deluxe Collection includes all aspiration, goods, and tools to create ultimate holiday looks. And M\u00b7A\u00b7C recently debuted its Frosted Firework collection, patterning with a diverse range of beauty influences, who generated over 60 million media impressions in the first 10 days after launching. Today, we will release our fiscal 2020 Citizenship and Sustainability Report entitled, Beauty Inspired, Value Driven. We are incredibly proud of the contribution of our employees around the world in accelerating our citizenship and sustainability efforts and have featured their successes in this year's report. The report highlights the achievement of our 2020 ESG goals as well as meaningful progress toward our 2025 goals. These milestones were reached across citizenship and sustainability priority focus areas despite the challenges of the pandemic. I'm pleased to announce the company has achieved net zero carbon emissions, and 100% renewable electricity globally for our own operations. Building upon this achievement, we also met our goals to set science-based emissions reduction targets addressing scope one and two for our data innovation in scope three for our value chain. Today announcement signals a new level of ambition and dedication to climate action for the SLO of the companies, setting targets in line with the latest climate science is testament to our values and our commitment to manage our business for the long-term. We are also proud to have reached zero industrial waste to landfill for our manufacturing, distribution, and innovation sites and we are on track to provide access to training on basic sustainability and corporate social impact programs for our employees worldwide this month. In addition, over the past two years, our programs that grants focus on health, education, and environment have positively impacted the lives of more than 20 million individuals worldwide. Our collective vision is to be the most inclusive and diverse prestige beauty company in the world, and to be the employer of choice for diverse talent at the brand of choice for diverse consumers. Our commitment to racial equality, especially our focus on driving racial equity across our business is central to achieving our vision. In today's report, we'll be publicly disclosing enhanced employee diversity metrics, and information on pay equity. We believe this transparency to all our stakeholders is important to holding ourselves accountable to our vision, while importantly, setting the stage to share our progress. In closing, there is no doubt that we are living and working in a moment unlike any other and yet, we are confident thanks to our passionate employees, cherished company values, and prudent strategy build multiple engines of growth. We are well-equipped to face the challenges of today and even better positioned to embrace the opportunities of tomorrow and continue growing global prestige beauty share. I will now turn the call over to Tracy. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. So, starting with the first quarter results, net sales decline 9% driven by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our brick-and-mortar distribution throughout the world. We achieved strong growth in our global online channel, Mainland China, and the skincare category and delivered better than expected results in the travel retail channel and in North America. Other areas progressively improved compared to last quarter as retail doors reopened. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart contributed approximately three points of net sales growth. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia-Pacific region rose 7%, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in skincare and the addition of Dr. Jart sales in Mainland China rose double-digits as sales in brick-and-mortar retail continued to improve. The pace of online sales growth in China was slower this quarter, following the highly successful 6.18 Mid-Year Shopping Festival programs last quarter. Most brands and channels rose double-digits and China. Korea rose high single-digits, excluding Dr. Jart and several smaller markets returned to growth as well. Sales in Japan declined due to a tough comparison to the prior year, in which sales grew nearly 20% as consumers bought ahead of an October 2019 VAT increase. The market has also suffered from softer in store traffic due to a second wave of COVID-19. Sales in Hong Kong continued to be depressed as well due to the pandemic. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region declined 9% with virtually every market continuing to feel the effects of the pandemic. While online growth continued to be quite strong, brick-and-mortar traffic remained soft, heavily impacted by COVID-19, which also resulted in significantly lower tourism in key markets. Skincare sales in the region grew double-digits driven by travel retail, but were more than offset by declines in makeup and fragrance. The major Western markets of France, Spain, and the U.K. contributed the most to the decline in sales, as did the Middle East. Our global travel retail business was essentially flat as outstanding results in Greater China, particularly Hainan Island and Hong Kong, and sequential improvement in Korea offset the effects of the significant reduction in international travel. Additionally, the growth of pre-tail and the increase in duty free purchase limits in Hainan drove higher conversion rates. Net sales in the Americas declined 24% as virtually all markets in the region continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Online sales growth continued to be a bright spot rising over 40%, however, brick-and-mortar retail remain difficult, especially in department stores and in freestanding stores. From a category standpoint, skincare was the most resilient. Net sales grew 10%, driven by continued strong performance from the Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands in Asia, including travel retail, as well as incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. Net sales and makeup fells 32%, a significant sequential improvement from last quarter. Make up the seen the biggest impact from COVID-19, as many consumers continue to partially or fully work from home and forego social gatherings. Fragrance net sales declined 13%, a substantial improvement from last quarter. The category grew strongly in Asia, reflecting double-digit increases from both Tom Ford and Jo Malone London, as well as the recent launches of Kilian Paris and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle in Mainland China. Bath, body, and home fragrances continue to perform very well. Our haircare net sales were essentially flat, declining only 1%, while stores and salons were not operating at full capacity during the quarter, the category benefited from exceptional innovation from Aveda, including the recent launch of Botanical Repair, as well as strong online sales. Our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Favorable category mix and lower costs for in-store testers were partially offset by negative currency impact. Operating expenses decreased 7% and the deleveraging effect of the sales decline caused operating expenses as a percent of sales to increase 80 basis points. Agile cost management and lower selling costs resulting from both channel mix and the impact of the COVID-19-related temporary furloughs and salary reductions on employee costs resulted in a 20% operating margin, which was just 60 basis points lower than the year ago quarter despite the lower sales. Diluted EPS of $1.44 decreased 14% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due to both improved sales performance as well as more proven cost management as doors reopened throughout the quarter. During the quarter, we generated $358 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was above the prior year, due primarily to timing of working capital items. We invested $116 million in capital expenditures, repaid the remaining $750 million outstanding on our bank revolver, and paid $174 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.53 per share. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration plan are on track with approvals expected to accelerate in the second quarter and benefits beginning to flow later in our fiscal year. So, now let's turn to our outlook. We are pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in nearly every market as the world continues to manage the effects of the pandemic. The path to recovery is not expected to be smooth as cases of COVID-19 have begun to surge again in many markets, creating renewed restrictions on travel and social activities. We are mindful of the risk of a global recession or a slow economic recovery as government support measures in certain markets taper off. We also recognize macro risks, such as ongoing trade tensions, and political uncertainty. Nonetheless, prestige beauty remains a highly desirable product category as evidenced by the sequential improvement in sales trends we experienced this quarter. And we believe our multiple engines of growth strategy positions as well to return to strong global results when the impacts from the pandemic subside. With only one quarter of the year completed and the degree of uncertainty I just described, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the full year. However, we will provide some underlying assumptions for the year. We continue to expect sequential quarterly sales improvement as the global recovery unfolds, assuming no significant second wave resulting in broad scale retail door closures again or other major disruptive events. And we do expect to return to sales growth as of the end -- as of the third quarter. Comparisons to our record performance in the past prior year first half will be difficult. Conversely, we expect sales and profit to grow significantly in the second half of the year against a period of considerable COVID-19 impacts, with particularly strong growth in the fourth quarter. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart should add about one to two percentage points to sales growth for the fiscal year, but remain slightly dilutive to profit for the year. We expect to close a number of our less productive freestanding retail stores and exit certain wholesale doors primarily in Western markets. While several of our retail customers are also reducing their store footprint, many of the unproductive doors are expected to close later in the fiscal year. Our gross margin is recovered from last quarters inefficiencies related to the sudden COVID-19 impact. Additionally, we continue to invest in increased capacity to support our strong skincare growth. We will continue to leverage a portion of the savings generated from our cost programs to support advertising and expanding services and capabilities to enable strong growth in our online channel. As I mentioned before, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.53 per share. We also expect to reinstate share repurchases as we gain comfort that the recovery is more sustained. So, while the environment remains quite uncertain, we are providing guidance for the second quarter. For the quarter, we expect sales to decline between 4% and 6% in constant currency. As a reminder, we are comparing against the record prior year quarter where we delivered 16% sales growth and 21% EPS growth last year. We have a robust lineup of holiday offerings at a variety of attractive price points that are carefully targeted to relevant consumer trends we are seeing during this pandemic and we expect continued strong online sales on our retailers and on our own brand sites. The incremental sales from Dr. Jart are expected to add about two points to growth and currency is expected to be accredited by approximately one point. We expect second quarter ups of $1.45 to $1.60, reflecting the sales outlook, continued cost containment measure, and investment in key growth areas like online innovation and China. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS and Dr. Jart is forecast to dilute EPS by $0.03. We will continue to leverage our multiple engines of growth to invest behind a strong recovery in the context of the macro environment. We are taking strategic actions to support long-term sustainable growth by investing appropriately for the long-term, while supporting the recovery in the near-term. With a more solid start to the fiscal year and mindful of continued macro volatility over the next several months, we look forward to leveraging the tremendous strength of our brands and driving a strong recovery as the market accommodates. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question was about channel make shift both longer term and in the quarter itself and for fiscal 2021. So, first piece of it is just over the longer term with the things you've already talked about the acceleration of ecommerce growth. Curious if you think it's fair to say that half of your margin expansion over the next several years could come from that that channel mix dynamic. The second was that as we look into fiscal 2021, how we should be thinking about the benefits of channel mix on one hand, but then the drags that you will experience as less productive doors get closed to the degree that there's stranded costs that come with that or what the impact of door closures -- your own doors and also wholesale doors or customers choosing due to closed doors, what impact that has on the P&L in the short-term? Thanks Fabrizio Freda : Yes. I will start and then Tracey, will join me in the answer. But basically, all our accelerating engine of growth by channels are more profitable, and that's the good news. On the other side, we have to deliver our brick and mortar productivity back to normal. And these obviously, would be influenced by how fast COVID retire and how fast they consumer get the confidence, again, to go in brick and mortar and as you -- as you said, by managing some closures. And then we need to turn the total company into growth. That, as Trace said, we believe this will be possible as of course, the trail. And so the combination of the improved accelerating engines of growth, which are more profitable, and the re-establishment of routines your brick and mortar will determine, when we can go back to our long term algorithms of growing about half a margin point per year. Tracey? Tracey Travis : Yes. And Lauren, as you indicated, I mean timing is will really impact that. So in terms of, when we expect door closures to occur. We've already had a number of wholesale door closers and freestanding door closures over the last few years, when you think about the number of retailers that have gone out of business, unfortunately, in the last couple of years. And certain retailers have also indicated their intent to close doors over the next couple of quarters. With our post-COVID acceleration program, we too will be closing doors over the next couple of quarters more towards the end of the year, as well as some freestanding stores. So there will be a timing issue where we do see pressure from under productive brick and mortar doors, while we see the uplift that Fabrizio spoke about from our online acceleration. And that's all embedded within the guidance that we've given certainly for the second quarter and, and we'll see how the second half of the year plays out. But that's certainly a dynamic that we will be managing in fiscal 2021 as the foreclosures are staged throughout the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning, guys. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Dara Mohsenian : So for Fabrizio, I was hoping maybe you could give us some perspective on how much of the increased ecommerce demand you've seen since the beginning of the pandemic is sustainable in your mind as you look at longer term? And perhaps within that, can you detail with the e-commerce sales increase you've seen during the pandemic? How much of that you think is driven by new customers? What level of repeat rates you're seeing among those new customers? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. So first of all, the increase of online is stored in, during this quarter in total, we were growing about 40%. But our brand.com and other -- and other -- some retailer.com are growing much stronger. Our brand.com is 60%. So the growth is consistent in IBD personally is here to stay. Sorry. And the reason, why it's here to stay because the -- a lot of this growth is about a new consumers that we see -- we see online. And many of these new consumer are mature consumers and before online was mainly the destination of younger people, millennials et cetera. Now is the convenient is for everyone. Everyone is online and also the people that before were not accustomed to go there are going there more often. So what we see is that people buy online, maybe in the future when the store will be open, we believe that omni-channel will be very strong and so people will use both brick and mortar and online obviously. But the amount of purchases online will stay higher and particularly will stay higher in our -- in our estimate in the mature group of consumers, which are very important for us, very important for beauty. So this is a sustainable trend and is sustainable acceleration. The second thing which is happen, which is very important is that historically however high tax services of, advice or of the service of customization of the -- or trying the products was exclusively done in stores, and then online at the beginning was mainly a convenience buying opportunity or what you already knew. Shopping was in brick and mortar and buying was online. This is changed forever. Now there\u2019s shopping a brick and mortar and there\u2019s shopping online. And what I mean with that is that the high catch services of customization of advice or recommendation are now super present online. And the consumers really are catered to the service like never before. So we spoke in our prepared remarks about the availability of chats, with consultants ability to visual trying on, the availability of live streaming opportunities, all these is increasing and the engagement of consumer online is increasing. We mentioned that, we have 30 minutes to presence on visual trying on versus only few minutes in the past. So the combination of new consumer's, particularly more mature consumer, better services online with a lot more time and more engagement. And the development of this opportunity for everyone, I think is going to be a sustainable and growing segment for many years to come. But obviously, we absolutely believe that omni-channel will be also important on the future, and the brick and mortar, we go back to the right level of productivity to the right level of traffic. And there will be a combination of the two. There will be an even better combination than in the past. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the progress, as you think about the makeup category. How are you planning for innovation going forward? What is the timeline look like? And also, Fabrizio, when you talk about channels, what are your thoughts on the specialty multi-channel going forward? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So our point of view and make up, we go back to be a very attractive, a very fast growing category, once called we retreat and is you know, the makeup is very much linked to use educations for makeup and the use of education for makeup include business, obviously meetings or, going to the office, includes social gathering of any kind, and include also positive mood of recovery and in the interest of expressing ourselves. And so the oldies will come back, will come back strongly, and make-up will come back with it. As we said in the prepared remarks, there are certain categories of make up which are already coming back. Already growing is visible the makeup is much stronger were called the bait like in Asia, and is -- so is obviously going to come back, and we will be ready for that. We are preparing starting from the categories that in our opinion, we come back first and -- and we are investing not only in ready to sustain the recovery, but also investing in innovation in the category that will be the first one to come back. If you take, today reality for example eye makeup is much stronger than other categories, just because in a period of masking, eye makeup is more relevant, then out of the lips, for example. And so -- there is a very positive trend in our opinion, just a matter of time. And that time will depend on the COVID. In terms of your second part of the question, specialty multi around the world will remain a very strong channel, very strong channel for us, a strong channel of growth and in specialty multi the strength, in our opinion, would also be the fact that the retail.com, this channel should continue to increase fashion to get out, to be very, very strong is the specialty multi the key opportunity is to continue to be strong in -- in-store, obviously, but particularly to become equally strong in the retail to come and to bring the services and the experiences that have been so strong in brick and mortar to the retail.com in the long term everywhere in the world. Dana Telsey : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes, hey, good morning. Thanks. Can we just talk a little bit more about the exit rates and consumption coming out of the first quarter? And what you're seeing in terms of momentum with a little bit more granularity whether by geography or category channel, however, you think is most instructive? And if you're able to share a little bit of data around October results, that would be great, because we clearly saw volatility in shipments timing over the course of the September quarter. So I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about that month-to-month lumpiness as we look through and out towards the end of the calendar year as well? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, I'll start, and please Tracey add, any perspective. If I understand correctly, your question, so the strength by category is in consumption is clearly in skin care and this remains very strong and in certain regions rather accelerating. And within skin care, there are certain sub-categories like moisturizers, serum, masks, which are really flying or eye products or products for the contour of the eye, et cetera. So, there are -- so skin care and certain skin care category is clearly the fastest growing consumption. Makeup, I just answer one question is makeups dependent by category eye makeup is strong consumption, for example lip makeup is under pressure in this moment. But even with this within category these allow us to focus more on the growth consumption in this category. Fragrance, surprisingly, back faster than what we originally thought and this is great news for the holidays. In fact, we are ready to try to push fragrances clearly in the best possible way during the holidays that we believe is a big opportunity, particularly our high-end fragrances in our artisanal fragrances like Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, KILIAN and Le Labo. Le Labo is extraordinarily well everywhere in the world. And so then hair care. Now, as I think Tracey explained in her prepared remarks that Aveda is doing exceptionally well. For us, Aveda is heading great innovation, a great program, great work online in support of also the salons that work with Aveda. And in this brand is also hitting all the areas, because is obviously is about natural, is about taking care of the world and so is also very much into the consumer space of sustainability. And this is starting to paying dividends. So hair care also is strong on consumption. And so net by category is skin care, strong hair care, strong fragrance recovery, and makeup is the more gradual recovery that we assume for the long-term. In terms of the dynamic of the regions, obviously, you have a consumption recovered in Asia, which is much faster than anyone else. And on the contrary, in the U.S. and in Europe, the impact of recovery has been much bigger. But we see progress everywhere. That's the important thing. The important thing is that the level of progress is recovery is consistent. Every part of the world, despite the Asia is ahead in the trend of recovery. And then in terms of consumer groups, consumption, I found particularly interesting that the consumption is being extraordinary in a more mature consumers. And that's what we see, that is a long-term benefit. I mean, the younger consumer is being the driver of [Indiscernible] and in this moment that's less the case. But the mature consumer being a bit more following the young consumer in the last probably five years, I think this is changing, the mature consumer are getting a much more active even in experimenting and trying new innovation. And again, this is for us is a very positive sign for the long-term. So consumption overall is gradually recovering, and is gradual recovery across every segment, but with very different return and speed by segments. Tracey Travis : And then in terms of the month or the second quarter, October came in, is coming in as we expected. So and it is reflected in our guidance. So I know we had starting in July, a little bit of a shipment to restart the business, given the fact that some of our inventory levels were low, particularly in North America we don't see anything like that in the second quarter. And as you probably know, Steve, October is the smaller of the three months in the second quarter, obviously, November and December with for us both Singles' Day in China and in Asia as well as holiday. November and December are by far the two bigger months. Steve Powers : Yes. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Erinn Murphy, Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : My question is around travel retail, it improve very nicely in the quarter. Could you just share a little bit about how much was driven from the higher duty free allowances in Hainan Island? And then how are you thinking about travel retail for the balance of the year? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. Travel retail as an exceptional performance and clearly the West, meaning Europe and the Americas are very, very basically closed or very, very small to travel. So the first thing is that the recovery has been being driven by Asia and within Asia, there are three elements which are driving this recovery. The first, as we discussed, is the acceleration of domestic travel within China with Hainan at the center of that. And Hainan has been seen both an increase of traffic meaning domestic tourism that came back at a very high percent, but I think that the number published, they are really about 80% of what they historically were in terms of domestic travel. And then in term of traffic and then the increase of possibility of buying per consumer that together it generated that the very big growth that we have seen, and we believe this is so sustainable. Then there is the opening on certain corridor in Asia, which has started particularly on Kong, Macau, and that we see in Korea is also starting being more solid. So -- and then is the retail, meaning online, the ability to reserve online, the product, which is accelerating dramatically, obviously in a moment where the consumer are still concerned to go in stores with a lot of people, the ability to do retail is serving their purpose and make them feel safer and protected. So the combination of those three things is -- has very important results, which is increasing conversion. As I said several times, in travel retail, the results are driven by traffic and conversion. And in this moment, even in presence of lower traffic, we are seeing a dramatic increase in conversion. And what do we see for the long-term? Under the long-term will be dependent, obviously, how traffic will be restated. The domestic travel in China is a new element. And obviously, this -- we believe will remain an opportunity for the long-term, the -- when international traffic will be reestablished will depend on COVID, obviously, and that we will monitor closely and serve this purpose, but the increase of retail as a percentage, particularly in Asia will remain a very positive element for the long-term, because will have an extraordinarily positive element -- impact, sorry on conversion even when international traffic will restart, that because of this is the combination of what's happened during COVID. And the opportunity of traffic recovery in the long-term will make this channel in our opinion, will remain one of the most interesting channels for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason English, Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning, Jason. Jason English : Congratulations on --thank you. Congratulations on sequential improvement, especially in travel retail. It's quite impressive. I want to come back to some of the questions on margins. As we were closing fiscal 2019, I think you finished with 17.5% EBIT margin; your 50 bps algorithm would have landed us to around 19.5% by fiscal 2023. And I referenced fiscal 2023. because it may be like the first year we're back to sort of normal, because we're going to have a lot of turbulence obviously for the remainder of this year, and then residual spillover just on door closures, et cetera in 2022. But if we're tracking towards the 19.5% in 2023 before, is there any reason that we can't get to it if not actually exceeded, right? You\u2019re pulling a lot of cost out, right now I imagine you'll discover that not all of need to go back. And you've got this pretty compelling from a margin mix perspective, tailwind. Why -- are there any offsets that would prevent you from getting to that 19.5% if not actually exceeding it, assuming 23% isn't de-normalized? Tracey Travis : Yes, I mean, I think in -- on the last call, Jason, we indicated that we expected to get potentially to our fiscal 2019 margins by fiscal 2022. Now part of the post-COVID acceleration program, certainly is helping to accelerate the achievement of that. But I think that math is a little aggressive right now for fiscal 2023. As we think about the recovery of the business, and obviously, it all depends on how quickly we get back to your point normal as it relates to normal consumption from a brick-and-mortar standpoint, and where the balance of the channel mix plays out. So that's a little bit aggressive, but recognize that certainly given the cost actions we take as it relates to post-COVID acceleration to accelerate our brick-and-mortar productivity and therefore help our margin. And some of the favorable mix items that Lauren indicated earlier from the growth of online as well as when travel retail resumes, which is another factor for us. We had good travel retail performance quarter. Travel retail is another accretive channel for us in international travel whenever that resumes and what that looks like will also be a factor. So we're very comfortable that we will have margin progression. And we will get to the 19.5 that you're referencing. It's just a matter of timing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the lineup Rob Ottenstein, Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I'd love to circle back to mainland China. And perhaps can you tell us a little bit about the overall sales growth online and offline, kind of what sort of impact travel retail had on the business. And given your comments about increases in domestic travel, retail in China and Hainan, should we kind of think that Mainland China X travel retail may not see the kind of growth that it's had before? And then, finally related to China, any kind of impact for timing on 11.11 did that have any impact? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So, no, I think we look at the Chinese consumers in total, and it was another extraordinary quarter for Chinese consumer consumption. We estimate that the total Chinese consumer consumption was about plus 20% and we were plus 28% to plus 30% range, when you look at the total, so extraordinary? Actually, I think we have developed the strength that when the Chinese consumer shopping mainly online, we are online and there are high traffic moment when this happen. When they come back to the store, we're there in brick-and-mortar. And this was a gain a double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar for the first time after COVID. When they go domestically travel go to Hainan, we are among the first being there being ready for that. So look at us as being dynamically following the Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop and wherever the traffic is side by quarter and see that flexibility as a strength rather than having every single China having to perform in the same every quarter. This is not going to happen. China is a very dynamic market. And in fact, the online, the 11.11 and then the 18.6 meaning the June events, which are two huge to do create the fact that in July, August is -- online is less strong. But then domestic travel was much stronger. And the real strength is to be able to be there at the right moment in every one of these channels. So Chinese consumers are strong. Our growth in China is strong. We are a local organization in China, really focus on the long-term with enormously built in flexibility and collaboration between different groups. This quarter that was particularly interesting because we have the more cities as explained. Brick-and-mortar went back to double-digit growth. Domestic travel went to about 80% of traffic. New consumers were coming in our brands, particularly from lower tier cities, via online and via the travel. And we launched 2 new brands, as you heard of Fragrances. On top of that, we are expanding our scientific presence and investing in a new research center, R&D in Shanghai that will give us new capabilities to even more locally relevant. So it is a very strong momentum for China. And we personally, I personally believe that the consumption of Chinese consumers will be growing strongly for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Fulvio Cazzol with Berenberg. Fulvio Cazzol : Yes. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I was wanting to ask about the innovation pipeline. There was some mentions made in the prepared remarks. And I remember in previous quarters, you highlighted that you were being opportunistic in terms of product launches, trying to time them when they could be the most effective. So I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of color on how your first quarter played out, if that benefit from some of the shifts of innovations from previous quarter or was it fairly normalized. And then following up on that, how should we think about Q2, and maybe even 2021? Is there a lot of pent-up, let's say, innovations to come out and help your growth along, please? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, first of all, our innovation has been very strong as 30% of sales in the previous quarter has been 20%, 25%. So frankly, we don't aim to a specific percentage as innovation is very strong and we have a great pipeline. So your question is how do we decide how to focus on which innovation? This obviously was the moment where skin care was the most demanded from consumers. And we tend to focus our innovation where there is the strongest trend and the stronger consumer demand. And so definitely skin care was a big focus. Now, obviously, on skin care, you cannot plan innovation in a few months is a very important investment for the long-term. So we had this extraordinary innovation advance the retailer and concentrate on La Mer that we have planned for that period. It's just that we went even deeper, even stronger because we saw the opportunity. So the innovation timing is set that we have flexibility obviously, to move them when needed. But the most important thing which is flexible, is the amount of investment, the amount of focus that we can have on different innovation, depending on the consumer demand in that specific moment and in a very different location. So I our agility is about we tailor innovation locally and so the local teams have the opportunity to launch it light, launch a big, go deeper, postpone demand, anticipate demand, there is a lot of flexibility to tailor the innovation to the local consumers. But the fundamental innovation is done with a very accurate pipeline for the long-term. And that's why we say that our pipeline is never been stronger, frankly, and this was already in place before COVID. Tracey Travis : And the only thing I would add to that we had also very strong innovation. We spoke about the fact that the fragrance category has been a nice surprise for us and that has been driven by innovation, across the board with our fragrance brands and then obviously haircare with Aveda. Aveda has had a couple of very strong innovation launches this year that really has driven a lot of momentum for us in haircare and certainly helped from a recovery standpoint, where we did see some shifts in innovation and from a timing standpoint is in the makeup category understandably. So we do have strong programs lined up for the second half of the year, in addition to skincare and fragrance and hair care, also for our makeup category, hopefully, as people start to gradually wear more makeup and perhaps become more socially active that innovation will actually pan out to help to continue to grow that makeup category. Fulvio Cazzol : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call.

During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. Let me first with that each of you are in good health and that your  families are well. Our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19 and our focus remains first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees, their families and our consumers. To our employees, you have lifted us up from caring for the physical and emotional wellbeing of colleagues to make in-hand sanitizer, seeking opportunities to support charities around the world, generously contributing to LCK [ph] employee relief fund and so much more. In December the company made an addition donation to the employees' fund and we continue to make progress on our citizenship and social impact commitments. Our employee's agility and creativity empower the company to deliver the exceptional results we announced today. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2021, sales rose 3% a 12 point positive swing from the decline of 9% in the first quarter. Impressively time brands grew led by the double-digit growth from Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer as well as great performance from Jo Malone London. Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle also rose double-digits. We focus our investment decisions on engines of growth while employing strict cost discipline in other areas delivering strong double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. In the quarter we faced increasing complexity from the pandemic, yet still delivered the results that exceeded our record second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when sales grew, the strongest in 20 years in our seasonally largest quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy continued to prove its value, enabling us to pivot with a GDP in this challenging moment. We successfully activated efforts behind the growth engines of skincare, fragrance, Asia-Pacific, travel retail in Asia and global online. Our skincare category performance extraordinarily. It's accelerating growth reflected the strong locally relevant innovation, successful year strategies, compelling ingredient narrative and deeper consumer relationships enabled by sophisticated data and analytics. Growth of our high repeat Hero products was broad based across sub categories from cleanses to watery lotion, serum, eye care and moisturizers. Our skin care business has continued to grow from strength to strength, bolstered by the teaser mind of the ritual of skincare as an expression of healthcare. From entry prestige to luxury, our brands excelled in skincare. Many brands contributed demonstrating the breadth of our performance. Dr. Jart provided incremental sales from our double-digit organic growth, we did appealing brand positioning. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand once again delivered double-digit growth across several of these Hero franchises in skincare. It's new advanced narrative serum was a powerful force, thanks to its new formula, a luxurious, more sustainable glass bottle. The serum delivered a healthy fit to Advanced Night Repair eye and these two Hero products benefited from their synergies and desirable sets. The brands revitalizing supreme franchise accelerated significantly, gaining momentum with its Hero moisturizer. La Mer leadership in luxury skincare group as consumers demand for its iconic products with powerful proven secrecy sort. Here two serum was a vibrant sub category. It's new debt concentrate was a big contributor to growth, amplifying trends of Hero like Van De La Mer and the treatment lotion. The new Genaissance de La Mer concentrated night balm performed exceptionally well, driving the brand's ultra luxury franchise to new highs. Clinique returned to growth lifted by skincare as it's Hero franchises that are focused on how to solve skincare problems like acme and dark spot, even better clinical interrupter is now firmly established as a core performance of the brand and continues to deliver significant growth. It was complimented by an acceleration in the brand's three-step product and acne solution lines. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances captivated consumer desires for Tone for Beauty, Joe Malone London, Le Labo, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and Kilian Paris innovations in iconic products were both highly sold. These brands all delivered stellar online sales growth along with improving brick-and-mortar sales in certain markets. Joe Malone London and Le Labo home products continue to flourish as consumer crave the sense to alleviate the sanctuary of their homes. Our global online channel delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth, significantly accelerated from the previous quarter and driven by every region. Growth was robust across the board as brand.com third party platforms, pure play and retail.com all contributed meaningfully. Our go to market strategies for each of these were tremendously successful, particularly during Black Friday, Fiber Week and [indiscernible] 1111 Global Shopping festival, driving strong consumer acquisition and retention. We continue to enhance our brand sites with high catch services. These strategies -- these strategic investments are elevating the consumer experience from convenience buying to enriched shopping, completely useful tools, targeted recommendation and expert advice. Across our brands, we are uniquely combining technology and data with our talented youth advisor on a global scale. Digital is proving to be incredibly powerful, driving over twice the engagement as well as higher conversion and retention rates. In the quarter, we added digital try [ph] to more sites around the world. The number of sessions nearly doubled from the pre quarter, reflecting both the expansion to additional sites as well as big uptick in activity on brand site that had previously launched it. Digital chat is also proving to be very impactful. In North America conversion of live chat session is nearly four times higher than average conversion in the market. Digital chat usage accelerated during the holiday season as our skilled beauty advisor offered useful insights and customized education to consumers, driving much higher basket site than average. Our brands are increasingly offsetting other engaging digital services and the experienced. Two examples are found on Clinique.com. Clinique Reality, the brand skin agnostic tool extracts the consumer in a highly personalized manner, driving notably strong conversion rates and Clinique Skin School addresses the growing demand for credible education in an entertaining format with a new focus on real-time interactions. Skin School brilliantly integrates live chat and trend-based programming with a brand expert consultant. We continue to pursue high touch innovation online as evidenced by the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand new AI driven product recommendations based on real-time consumer behavior and past preferences that we're piloting in North America. We anticipate that these dynamic merchandising holds great promise and are excited to scale in this year for Est\u00e9e Lauder as well for other brands. We are welcoming new consumers on our brand sites, but also successfully driving repeat enable in part by our loyalty programs. In the first half of fiscal year 2021, the number of loyalty programs members who both rose strong double-digits driven by travel digit growth of international loyalty program members. In so many ways, we are building deeper relationship with our consumers. Our brands delivered excellent results for [indiscernible] 1111 Global shopping Festival leveraging the latest live streaming technology and capabilities to generate product discovery. For 1111 the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand moved into the number one rank in beauty. La Mer notched number one rank in luxury beauty. Mac was the number one prestige make up brand and Jo Malone London was the leader in fragrance. We have long believed in the compelling growth prospects of online and had been investing in it for more than two decades. At the onset of COVID-19, we nearly doubled our rate of online investment, including accelerating our consumer facing investment like digital, social selling, Omni channel or loyalty programs. We're also increasing our investment in our digital infrastructure and fulfillment network to meet the much higher traffic and demand. In addition to these capital investments, we continue to optimize our advertising investment in digital channels as well as invest in our great online talent domestically in our headquarters in New York and in our local markets around the world. I'm on the regions, Asia-Pacific delivered the strongest sequential improvement with sales growth accelerating from 7% to 27%. Mainland China prospered while Korea and several smaller markets contributed organically. In Mainland China momentum in brick-and-mortar carried into the quarter with sales again growing double-digit. Online accelerated significantly, elevated by a remarkable 1111 event. Nearly every brand grew as across Le brands we reached more consumers, thanks to locally relevant innovation Hero products, rich storytelling and successful influencer activations, as well as the dedication and creativity of the local team in China. Travel retail grew single-digit organically driven by strong results in Asia, particularly in Heinen as we fulfilled the desires of the travelling Chinese consumers with a deal merchandizing. Traffic to Heinen continued to rebound and duty free annual partial limit had increased threefold there in July, providing a favorable benefit in the quarter as consumers saw to spend to the new annual limit before year-end. Conversion was also a strong driver, owing prepaid, which newly offered live streaming. Across channels, demand from Chinese consumers accelerated, especially in skincare and fragrance. The long-term growth opportunity we foresee in the dynamic Asia-Pacific region rebounded. Over the last fixed demands despite the challenges of the pandemic we made three significant investment commitments as we strive to best meet the desires of Chinese and Asian consumers. In late 2019, we acquired the Korean based skincare brand Dr. Jart, while in nearly 2020, we committed to build an end to end innovation center in Shanghai. Today I'm pleased to confer we're building a state of art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. We're on track to open our Shanghai innovation center in spring 2022. This will increase our local capabilities in product design and formulation. We're also strengthening our consumer insight and trend analytics in this vibrant market. We broke ground in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is to be operational in late 2022. It will enable us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the region. The facility will house advanced technologies and engineering achievement, with high standards of sustainability and safety and will be designed to promote flexible and leading-edge working environment. Across our engines, innovation contributed significantly in the second quarter ahead of our aggressive goals driven by focus on fewer bigger and better Hero innovations. We have an enticing pipeline of new product launches for the remainder of our fiscal year. Already our are two in skincare, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand launched supreme bright. It addresses the trend of bright in Asia and is also highly relevant for consumers of old skin tones around the world with it's even better skin tone, dark spot benefits meeting top needs of the multiethnic consumers. Clinique introduced monster sewage search one handed hour with an exclusive deal that provides hydration that goes 10 layers deep into skin surface and also lasts 100 hours even after you wash your face. In the Clinique launched even better clinical serum foundation a weightless liquid foundation with 24 hours ware, a good for skin ingredients to have visibly improving skin instantly and over time. Our strategic focus and investment in our ESG goals remain of utmost importance for us in our key stakeholders and we continue to advance our work in the quarter. Let me share a few examples in sustainable ingredients in packaging and inclusion and diversity for the many areas of our recent progress. We're pleased to have joined CDPs 2020 Climate A list having been awarded the highest score of A. In January Aveda proudly announced that its products are bigger as a mission driven brand this was a natural step for Aveda, a brand that continuously works to reduce its environmentally but while also responding to the fast-growing consumer trends. Our brands are employing more innovative and sustainable packaging as they launch new products while also improving the packaging of existing products, the two new Clinique products, which I just described two such example of innovation launching in more sustainable package. To continue to invest in, in advance our diverse talent, we created a sponsorship program for equitable advance and professional development of our black talent from every chair leadership development program will ensure that our black employees have the support and focus of senior executives and equitable access to leadership training, mentorship and career development opportunities. In closing we delivered excellent performance amid the pandemic, leveraging the strength of our multiple engines of growth strategy, Hero products and robust innovation. We did this while leading our values as we increasingly embedded ESG in everything we do, focusing on safety and wellbeing of our employees, making progress on our environment goals, enacting on our racial equity commitments. We also invested in technology and data for new capabilities to support accelerating growth drivers. These accomplishments and actions give us confidence that we are well-positioned to continue to drive recovery and return to our long-term growth targets after the period of recovery. I'm incredibly grateful to our employees whose grace and fortitude are making us a better company throughout this very difficult moment. While the road ahead will still be challenging together we can be optimistic that brighter days are coming. I wish each one of you good health. And now, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio and I certainly echo your comments regarding our wonderful employees. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Renee mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. Our net sales rose 3% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continue to pressure traffic in our brick-and-mortar distribution, but sales declines in stores were entirely offset by strong growth across our online channels and in travel retail in Asia. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jar added approximately three point to net sales growth. Sales performed above our expectations in large part reflecting the outstanding execution during the annual team 1111 Shopping festival as well as the many activations our brands deployed during key shopping events like Brett Black Friday and Fiber Week. In addition to the acceleration and growth we saw in skincare, fragrance sales were strong in the quarter and home fragrance continued to resonate during the pandemic. Our gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Favorable channel mix was driven by the growth in our online sales and also reflects lower costs for testers in our brick-and-mortar distribution. From a category perspective, the acceleration of sales in skincare also benefited gross margin. The positive mix was partially offset by higher obsolescence and a negative currency impact. Operating expenses improved by 160 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting both the strength of our sales leverage during key shopping moments and our cost containment measures. Many of our COVID related cost containment measures remained in place during the quarter and contributed to our improved profitability along with the benefits of our leading beauty forward initiative. Lower selling cost and other in-store promotion cost also reflected the mix shift of our business from brick-and-mortar to online as well as some remaining government subsidies in certain countries. Given the challenged environment, we continue to experience periodic tour closures. Partially offsetting the cost favorability was higher investment behind our strategic priorities, including China, online and digital technology as well as the inclusion of Dr. Jart expenses this year. As a result, our operating margin rose 170 basis points to 24.3%, a significant accomplishment during this important holiday quarter considering the record results achieved in the year ago period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 15.9%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the recognition of a onetime retroactive benefit related to recently finalized guilty US tax rate regulation. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% reflecting this development. Diluted EPS of $2.61 increased 24% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the combination of strong performance during the key shopping moments in the quarter and the lower tax rate while maintaining strict cost management. This performance is truly a testament to our team's ability to navigate the business through the difficult macroenvironment. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Through the past six months, we've taken charges of $46 million primarily to close underperforming freestanding retail stores in our EMEA region and an employee-related cost as we align resources to support our online business and our digital capabilities. As the program continues in the second half we expect to continue to rationalize our retail footprint primarily in Western market. Additionally, we took an $81 million impairment charge for our glam glove brand reflecting the COVID-related disruption of the brand growth plans and lower than expected growth from its planned geographic expansion. During the first half of our fiscal year, we generated $1.98 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, due primarily to improvements in working capital management. Accounts payable increased reflecting timing-related items that also support our second-half growth plans and accounts receivable reflected the rapid growth in our direct to consumer business and a five-day improvement in DSO. We invested $250 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like additional production capacity and technology. Conversely we spent far less on counters and stores due to lower traffic and brick-and-mortar doors. We ended December with $5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents just above our total debt. With the strength of our cash position, our free cash flow generation and our confidence in our business drivers as we recover, we expect to reinstate share repurchases and maintain our dividend during the second half of our fiscal year. So now let's turn to our outlook, we are obviously encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in every region as we continue to manage through the effects of the pandemic. While cases of COVID-19 and the variance of surging again in some markets, resulting in renewed door closures, restrictions and lockdowns, we are optimistic that once the vaccines reach enough of the global population, the restrictions on travel and social activities will ease. Nonetheless we've not assume a second wave. Therefore, the more accelerated global recovery we originally anticipated in our second half has clearly been delayed. So while we are pleased with our performance in the first half, the prolonged uncertainty with respect to the pace and timing of the recovery makes it still difficult to provide sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We do continue to expect sequential, quarterly sales growth improvement as comparisons to the prior year ease and the global recovery unfolds. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart, which benefited our growth in the first half adds two percentage points to sales growth for the full fiscal year. As you know, several of our retail customers are liquidating or reducing their store footprints. Notably Lord & Taylor, Staged Stores and [indiscernible] are liquidating and Macy's, Nordstrom [ph] have announced store reductions. Additionally, we expect to close certain freestanding stores in North America and EMEA now that the holidays are behind us. In aggregate, the law sales represent between 1% and 2% of our total full-year sales and we do expect to recapture a portion of those sales in other locations in online. While we will continue to execute our cost savings programs, it is important to recognize that some of the temporary cost measures we took last year will be returning in the coming months. The principal areas of returning cost includes some additional advertising, promotion and point-of-sale employee cost, which were all meaningfully reduced during the time that retail doors were closed last year, as well as the restoration of certain temporary pay reductions we took. Travel and retail consulting costs are expected to ramp up more slowly. Costs will also increase as offices reopen and our facility to continue to implement enhanced safety protocols. We will incur incremental spending for our new Asian manufacturing plant and innovation center and as we continue to see signs of consumer's willingness to resume their normal activities including return to stores, we plan to invest incrementally as we normally did pre-pandemic in our fourth quarter to strongly support our launch programs and begin to reaccelerate our makeup business in the upcoming fiscal year. Looking at the near term, for the third quarter we expect sales to rise between 10% and 11% in constant currency. We have a terrific lineup of product offerings and activations for the Lunar New Year and we expect continued strong online sales. You may recall that we had an exceptional January last year. We have lacked the purchase of Dr. Jart at the beginning of our third quarter and the brand is now part of our organic growth. Currently, is expected to be accretive by approximately three percentage points. Third quarter EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.20 reflecting the sales outlook and a careful balance between cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas such as online and technology and currency is expected to add $0.03 to EPS. We remain optimistic that the pandemic will be controlled and out of home activities will resume under a new normal. With a solid first half behind us, we've proven we can deliver in the context of a difficult macroenvironment while continuing to support our employees, our social and environmental commitment and invest in the capabilities needed to sustain our growth over the long term. The resiliency of our business during this time and the passion and dedication of our teams, reinforce our confidence in our strategy and the continuation of our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So I wanted to focus on topline, clearly very strong performance in skincare and e-commerce during COVID. Can you talk about the sustainability of that strength in each of those areas as we move to a post-COVID environment as well as what some of your key strategies might be to maintain momentum post-COVID and then on the makeup side, that's obviously been a laggard area for obvious reasons. How quickly do you think category growth recovers in makeup post-COVID and what's your outlook there, thanks? Fabrizio Freda : Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us let's go one by one, skincare very sustainable. The consumers always were more and more enthusiastic for skincare. We have an amazing pipeline innovation for the future years and the strengths of Asia and particularly of China is internal mix one of the biggest builder of skincare because the penetration of skincare, the penetration of beauty for skincare in Asia is very, very high. So we assume the skincare strengths will continue after COVID. The other driver is China and the potential of China as we explained very well at our Investor Day is for the long-term. The Chinese -- the demographic arrived the potential of the smaller cities of tier three and tier four cities will continue to grow. The power of online and offline distribution will continue to be very strong. In TR imagine that the TR growth today, the TR results are mainly driven by Asia and particularly by the domestic travel acceleration within China. So in the future, the domestic travel acceleration within China will continue, but the international travel will be reinstated and so this will be a father acceleration in the long-term when COVID will abate. So all our key drivers are really here for the long-term and most importantly as you know, our drivers tend to be accretive in profitability. So they will clear resources over time. The lager is a brick-and-mortar particularly in the West. Now this obviously in the short term is an issue because there is a lack of traffic and the lack of traffic has created issues of productivity but also on this one, we are working for rebuilding this for the long-term and so what is a drag today, a big drag on what is about one third of our business is still in brick-and-mortar in the West and so you should imagine that the traffic post COVID will come back that there are all the retailer closures that Tracy summarized, which are happening that will reduce the amount of stores which not be sustainable in the long term and our business acceleration program, which is really putting that right sizing if you want all the channel for us rebuilding productivity over time. And so the combination of traffic closures and business acceleration program is our answer to in the long term after COVID been able to make also brick-and-mortar a gain and engines of growth, which will be profitable in building the company for the long-term. So we are very positive in summary on the continuous trends post COVID of our drivers, new accelerated drivers and we are working to make also what is a drag in the short-term rebuilt as a positive long-term channel which is the brick-and-mortar in the West. Internal makeup was the last part of your question, makeup is very much driven by user locations. So user location meaning to going to the office, going out for dinner, having etcetera. So clearly the makeup category growth will be associated with the post recovery and we will be ready for that. Our point of view is that when the user location will go back into the lives of people, the recovery will be fast and steep and so we are ready for that. Now if when do we assume this will happen frankly, the answer is difficult to answer the same way Tracey explained is difficult to answer, when vaccination all the rest will have a full impact, but we believe that from what we see in the market just casting the full of 2021, we could see beginning of certain usage location to the established because of this makeup growth with follow back in our opinion starting from that moment particularly. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was curious if we could talk a little bit about e-commerce development in Western Europe in particular because I think with certain hidden if you will in the numbers you work through contributions from travel retail and so on is that Western Europe while still down of course is down I think a lot less than has been the case thus far through the pandemic. You mentioned the Cyber Week kind of shopping dynamic in Western Europe, but my sense is that that is a channel that had been somewhat less developed. Historically, so I'd love to hear more about how that build up and thinking about kind of stickiness of that behavior going ahead particularly in a quarter to whether aren't big shopping events that are typical for that market thanks. Fabrizio Freda : So first of all the online business has done very well this quarter plus 60% globally and is interesting we are growing double or triple digit in every brand, every region, every channel, a meaningful channel brand.com, retail.com, third party platform pure plays and so Western Europe is the same. Western Europe is growing depending by market double-digit or triple digit in online and obviously the holiday season has been because of the lockdown as you know in Western Europe particularly COVID was pretty high in November, December. Because of this, the brick-and-mortar were closed in countries like the UK as an example, December was a super difficult month and so it was no regular Christmas holidays in brick-and-mortar and obviously UK was not the only place and so because of this we were able to pivot to online in an historical way. I think our teams have done an amazing work in taking care of our consumer online when they were because of proven behavior for COVID now going into the brick-and-mortar and what we've seen that this works in many, many cases meaning again the consumer's certain categories we're working because of repeat meaning the consumer didn\u2019t do without their preferred Le Mer cream or their preferred advanced whatever and so we got a lot of the selling via the online channel. But also we are able to stick to their gifting habits and we created gifting opportunities and delivering all those for gifting etcetera. So it was a lot of activity and invention in this area. Now this online in general, I believe the online will continue to be very strong also in the long-term and this acceleration will continue also post COVID and one of the reason for that which is particularly true in Western Europe is that the new online focus created growth online, more than created new consumers including more mature consumers. Online particularly in Europe was really dedicated to millennial or younger consumers while during COVID, more mature consumers came online and they're lacking it and they're becoming loyal and so they will also post COVID have a bigger percentage of their shopping online than before. On top of this, if you think that we are adding high touch services online, so what were the services that in before were available in brick-and-mortar now gradually but they're also available online and we've been able to scale the speed online. Just to give you a number to understand our ability to scale new ideas is today digital try [ph] is already available in 90% of our brand.com sales internal coverage. Now imagine that that it was not even close to that six months ago and so the consumer responded to that and this is driving also in Western Europe a lot of online and probably sustainable and more loyalty online across different group of consumers. So online had a big role in Western Europe in quarter two and will continue to have a bigger and growing role over time in the next years. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Question is around the landscape where in North America we've seen some pretty unique partnerships recently with [indiscernible]. Are you expecting to participate in these partnerships? I know historically math hasn\u2019t been that appealing but maybe with ultra target structure what's coming your brand expense? And then I guess secondly if you think about the post behavior of consumer retailer post pandemic, how comfortable are you with the entirety of this brand portfolio today if that ever makes sense? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So I didn\u2019t understand the second question. Erinn Murphy : Are there any brands thinking of the makeup portfolio in particular that you would ever consider investing on the other side of the pandemic. I am just curious on your comfort with the entirety of the portfolio today? Fabrizio Freda : So the first answer is yes, we are working with our partners and discussing the ultra target and the calls opportunities as you said as part of your question. This will depend on which brands in our portfolio these two opportunities may fit different brands in our portfolio and so we are evaluating these with our partners and we are considering participation by brand to these activities and this could be a driver of future acceleration of the COVID in North America as well, importantly to underline these two opportunities are both brick-and-mortar and online and so obviously it will be very important also to been able to manage the online part of that opportunity. In term of the portfolio of brands, we continuously look at our portfolio. We look at our portfolio for efficiency and we open with Dundee's already in the past to rationalization decisions in our portfolio meaning closing brands that for a good reason do not -- cannot sustain the long-term investments and we continue looking into acquisitions an opportunity for reinforcing our portfolio in areas where we have strategic opportunities or strategic apps. So this is a continuous process and during COVID this is continuing. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So Fabrizio I had a question just on your China business, I was curious what you're seeing right now in the makeup category in China? Fabrizio Freda : Yeah the makeup category in China is stronger than makeup in the other regions because as I say responded to broader social locations and the user locations, but it's still decline, so is not different than the rest of the world China meaning skincare is very, very strong, fragrance is accelerating and makeup is large even in China however, on a completely different proportion because when you see -- when you think of this nature just gave before that makeup is completely correlate to the location of user in China because of the good control of COVID and because of the occasions like business offices are open, people are shopping more regularly, brick-and-mortar shopping is more present in most of the cities. Because of these more occasions makeup is in better shape but still is the lag between the categories and mostly in China I'd say from our consumer understanding is because of mask waving meaning China is better controlling COVID but also better controlling COVID because there is very disciplined mask wearing and mask wearing also is the reason for less use of makeup. So stronger than the rest of the world but still not as strong as it will be after COVID and post COVID where we assume there will be or expect that will be a strong recovery on makeup also in China. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Fabrizio, I wanted to go back on the online discussions, you guys have done a great job with analytics and understanding consumer behavior and given how much migration has occurred on one, I'm just curious what your data and research and analytics are saying about the stickiness. For instance, you talk about the very mature consumers and developed markets migrating online, how strictly do you think that behavior will be I think that will be an important discussion going forward given the margin differential between online and some of the other channels, thank you. Fabrizio Freda : It's a very good question and again our point of view this will be very sticky because the people shopping online and obviously some of them are shopping online because the brick-and-mortar were closed for showing the case of luxury, but they're lacking it and we see all the statistics, all the data telling us they are enjoying the skills. For example, our loyalty programs are working better and better and we have more loyalty program as we discussed and they're getting expanded and the level of loyalty is going up and the re-pastures rate meaning they're coming, that is going up. Then we see conversions very strong and traffic increasing and there are ways where the conversion will be driven will be maintained after. The most important of the investment we're doing in order to maintain conversion also after COVID is the high touch services transfer online. So the chart with the consultants, digital try on, the live streaming opportunities, the use of our particularly the brand.com in this case also has media platform because we see that the time that the consumers are spending on online is increasing dramatically because when the digital try-on service, the possibility to consult, they spend more time and this time is time of disposure to our equity messages. So this is media value, this is really media value meaning we have more than half billion consumers coming on our site and more in this moment and then imagine that they stay nine minutes and they say if we're to buy media to speak to half a billion consumers for nine minutes this will be a huge cost while building place is another benefit of our selling operations. So there is a lot of value in these high touch services. What they will do is they will increase differentiation of our sites from us. They will increase traffic because people are coming not only to buy product for the services and will maintain or possibly farther increase conversion after COVID and then finally will increase the value of our online as media value and so this is a very positive view for the long-term. Obviously we believe that there is a lot of consumer that will continue to shop also in brick-and-mortar after COVID and there is no one consumer there is only online, only brick-and-mortar. I believe the consumer would love the omnichannel speed particularly after COVID they will be anxious to get a gain to brick-and-mortar experience, so they will come back and that's why we are building around these realities this expectation, imagine better omnichannel platform where the consumer will be able to choose the percentage of time or the speed in online and how much they want in brick-and-mortar and that will navigate and on the two channels in new ways. I believe that companies that will have brands that will have a good omnichannel model in the future will have a competitive advantage. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : First just a clarification, Tracey I believe you said that you were adding additional production capacity, so just curious what categories, what regions you were looking at for that and then my question is really around the margin progression especially given this quarter. So I think that's the highest quarterly operating margin you\u2019ve achieved, there is a couple of companies. So realizing of course that there is a lot of more and more expenditures that are coming right now, but as you think about second half long-term, are there things you burn over the course of almost 12 months now on areas you can come back -- cut back on spend more permanently or are there areas where you have to just push even harder and as you think about specifically for Q3 what's planned in Q3 because while you're looking for margin expansion, it looks like it would only imply about similar to what you achieved in fiscal Q2 despite COVID obviously now entering the base. Thank you. Tracey Travis : So regarding our production capacity as you\u2019ve seen from our results over the last couple of quarters, clearly where we have been in need and have been investing in terms of production capacity is in skincare and we have invested in North America, we've invested in Europe and as you heard us announce this morning in our prepared remarks, we are also investing in a new facility in Asia to support primarily skincare and there will be some makeup primarily foundation as we're thinking right now in Asia. So very much having capacity closer to where our strong demand growth is will be a real benefit to us and we're looking, were certainly looking forward to that. As it relates to the margin, I would as I said in my prepared remarks Olivia, we had done an excellent job of controlling cost last year once the pandemic hit. Many of those cost controls were temporary controls. When you think about the management salary reductions, some of the rent abatements that we got, given the fact that our stores were closed, some of the furloughing benefit and some of the other back on we controlled headcount, TV, etcetera. So selling terms of the learning going forward, clearly there are some areas of I'd say more discretionary cost as we emerge out of the pandemic that we will continue to control, but the long-term sustainable cost controls really come from our cost saving programs. That's where the permanence, more sustainable cost take up comes from. So that's the reason why you're seeing if you think about what we said last year in terms of our cost programs and the significant amount of management that we did in the third and the fourth quarter to control costs given the fact that all of our brick-and-mortar doors over the course ended up closing that some of those costs certainly will be back in the second half in the third and the fourth quarter. But we will continue to manage costs in a disciplined way as we have up to this point. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : So I just wanted to follow up on the operating margin question, I think it's important EMEA strongest margin we've seen, fragrances I think strongest margin we've seen and from just hearing the answer to that question, it sound like there was -- there has been a lot of efforts around cost savings, but certainly the channel dynamic as well with EMEA online doubling and certainly you\u2019ve seen strengthen in skincare in Asia and so I'm just wondering how much the margin improvement actually might be more sustainable over time from channel mix standpoint? Tracey Travis : Absolutely, we have tailwind as it relates to margin given both our category mix growth as well as our channel mix growth. We do have obviously a fairly large footprint of brick-and-mortar that right now given where traffic is, is a bit of a drag on our margin performance and obviously we're addressing that and we will see once the pandemic is behind us and traffic returns, how fast it returns and in the meantime obviously we're taking some actions but we are very comfortable that we have margin progression ahead of us once the pandemic is behind on in a more sustainable way, especially given the tailwinds that we have to your point Chris. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : I do want to follow that Tracey, at the Analyst Day, you walked us through a margin that was well into the high teens on what you knew on the business there as we look around at some of the businesses that I'd say are probably the closest in comparison to yours, we see some with some of the two on the operating margin. Obviously you\u2019ve made structural changes that a few of the other analysts have run through, but you're going to end up in a bigger travel business, bigger digital business, bigger China business closing some stores that were a drag. Do you see over the very long term 10 years can this business move into the 20s on margin? Tracey Travis : It's again over the very long term, so look I'd say that certainly that is something that we are targeting, given all of our -- again given the tailwind in terms of channel growth and category growth might change obviously makeup might we believe makeup will recover and we're certainly going to support it to recover and the margins will improve on makeup as well. Makeup actually is the category that has the biggest penetration of freestanding stores and brick-and-mortar. So it is a category that is particularly challenged from a margin standpoint in this particular environment. But certainly Michael, everything that we're doing from a business management standpoint and from a cost management standpoint would get us in that North Star of 20%. Michael Binetti : And so to follow that, you\u2019ve seen some really strong growth in time and it's come up a bit in the last two calls. We see something regularly even as recently this week, government is going to allow consumer shipments home versus physical pickup in the past. So it seems like there is more and more friction coming out of that process and a lot of square footage is going to be added there. Does island change your travel retail business even after global economies reopened and change your outlook on travel and the Chinese domestic consumer? Fabrizio Freda : Yes now as I said before, our travel retail business in the short term is really driven by Asia in general and China domestic in particular within China domestic, China is the star and is driven by the new traffic and by the increased conversion and by the quantities past just because of the regulations that you just explained and by the developmental of retail. So those are all very important long-term strengths of the channel which is developing. Now when the normal travel will and will never be normal except, but the new normal travel stated after COVID and you are this progress of the domestic travel in China, the international travel in America and Europe within the rest of Asia and the Chinese consumer will go back travelling the world and that's obviously their desire one of the biggest aspiration shoot to the consumer when I look to the consumer opinions and research for the long-term. So when there will be a combination of the stated international travel with stronger domestic travel model that has been developed during this period, this will make still one of the most important long term channels of opportunity -- full of opportunities and again the biggest opportunity remain technically driving conversion. So the conversion of travelers into bias and the retail, so the possibility of buying also without queuing in a store for a long time where you need to take a plane I think, those two elements are big drivers of the future travel retail independently from the short-term management of the cash. And in term of the China overall business, we do monitor Chinese consumers. We spoke to it last time. This time our Chinese business between quarter one and quarter two is basically double the level of growth our China mainland business. Our TR business has also accelerate but not as strong as the China Mainland business which was driven by amazing online events like 1111 during the November period. And so the combination of the development of online within China the sudden brick-and-mortar in China is still double-digit in quarter two was growing double-digit showing the potential of brick-and-mortar when COVID is more managed or will be more manageable and then travel retail continues to do very well and so when look is also to our total Chinese consumer consumption bringing altogether what is domestic travel retail and Mainland China we still see an acceleration in total from quarter one to quarter two and so we believe this is a very, very strong potentially. We're working to manage it in a way which is still building equity of our brands, still protecting every single one of our partners been able to do good business with us for the long-term and that's our goal and we are working on it. Operator : And our last question is going to come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Maybe just follow-up and one other question, so just on online where does did that settle as a percentage of the category sales post pandemic and how do you think about retention of those incremental consumers on reseller.com versus your own brand.com. I've seen for you all and then just quickly, holistically I am thinking about your guidance on a go forward basis, are big events like 618 and 1111 becoming more important in driving your business meaning that the June quarter might be a little bit bigger than its historical level. Same thing for the December quarter and to that part can you explain kind of why we saw somewhat weaker September quarter guidance and I think maybe people had expected the time is same for the March quarter today. Thank you. Tracey Travis : Let me talk about the key shopping moments, absolutely particularly in the holiday period as you recall last year in the second quarter we had a 16% growth in constant currency, very much driven by key events that that are in the second quarter. The fourth quarter 618 did quite a bit actually less meaningful to the quarter than certainly 1111, but we are seeing concentration in some of those events and certainly that be in terms of our expectation on sales really flowed through to the bottom line in the second quarter. Fabrizio Freda : Brand.com, online is different channels, they are brand.com, retail.com, pure play and third-party platform, which we did find that the chemo model and so these channels have different level of developments by counties and this is the results of consumer preferences and historical development of the channel. So it's not that we're driving. We're driving all of them and particularly we work with our retail partners very close to drive their retail.com, which is most of the times doing very well, particularly in this period but also for the long-term. So for example in China, retail.com is very limited and white brand.com and most importantly, third-party platform is the most developed while in the US, retail.com is very, very strong and we see a lot of great developments recently in the retail.com of our key partners and this also serves in this moment as a mitigating factor to the brick-and-mortar issues of productivity that we've discussed before. So we will continue develop each one of these channels and is the consumer deciding where to go and obviously we talked with each one of our retail partners to do the best possible job in every channel.

Our hearts are with those impacted by COVID-19, particularly in places like India and Brazil, that are experiencing severe resurgences. We remain committed to doing what we can to support our employees and these communities. Our third quarter of the fiscal year 2021 marks the continuation of strong sequential sales growth improvements, despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. We exceeded our sales and earnings growth expectation, even as several markets experienced increasing COVID-19 pressure throughout the quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy drove our success, empowered by the exceptional creativity and passion of our employees. We achieved these outstanding results while acting on our values. First and foremost, we continued to invest in employees and consumer safety and well being during the health crisis. We expanded our work for the environment from setting innovative new sustainability goals in travel retail to seeing a wind farm in Oklahoma became fully operational, which is our largest renewable energy concept to date, and a project we were proud to support. We made progress on our racial equity commitments, and also outlined a new set of commitments for women advanced in gender equality, inclusive of achieving gender pay equity and globally increased representation of women from underrepresented groups. In March, we launched our new Equity and Engagement Center of Excellence, to drive greater equity representation within our business and across the value chain. We also launched the partnership with Howard University to support the success of its alumnae to our experiential learning, career coaching, professional training, and mentorship opportunities. While there was joy in this progress, there was also sorrow. We stood with our employees, consumers and partners in denouncing the rise in acts of violence, hate and discrimination against the Asia and Pacific Islander community, and committed to donate to organizations that support justice and equal treatment from Asian community in the United States. We keep our employees and communities top of mind through these challenging times. With that as our guiding principle, let me turn back to financial results. Constant currency sales rose 13%, representing a substantial acceleration of organic sales growth improvement. We delivered strong performance despite increased COVID-19 hardship in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America during the quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tone for Beauty lead the impressive performance of many brands. Skin care and fragrance once again delivered superior sales growth, although they had the toughest comparison to the year-ago period. In fact, our skin care category was nearly 30% larger on a reported basis this quarter than it was 2 years ago, owing to innovation in our powerful Hero franchises, strength across multiple subcategories and the addition of Dr Jart, but before the future inclusion updation. In our fragrance category, it was 16% bigger than it was in fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, driven by our strategic focus on the luxury and our seasonal segments. Both of these categories now have even greater scale to capture prestige beauty share as the recovery unfolds. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we focused our investment decisions on engines of growth and employed cost discipline in other areas, resulting in a near doubling of adjusted diluted earnings per share versus the prior year period. While the complexities of the pandemic are ever present, adjusted operating margin nonetheless exceeded that of the third quarter of fiscal year '19. And adjusted diluted earnings per share was 5% higher. Throughout the pandemic, we have been steadfast in our commitment to the long-term, as we successfully navigate the short-term. We continue to strategically invest to drive sustainable growth, including building an end-to-end Innovation Center in Shanghai, and state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. These are expected to open in calendar year 2022. More recently, several of our brands decided to participate in the new partnership of Sephora with Kohl's recalls and Ulta beauty with Target, beginning in the second half of this calendar year. This new consumer coverage represents the promising evolution of the retail landscape both in store and online in the United States for prestige beauty. We also agreed to increase our ownership in DECIEM, becoming majority investors with the path to full ownership in 3 years. DECIEM with its fast growing brand, the ordinary and new brands incubation capability aligns well with our multiple engines of growth strategy. The ordinary further #diversifies our skin care growth engine by consumer segments, price point and geography with a superior online business. The brand has redefined entry prestige with an increased ingredient focused regimen based product portfolio that drives basket size. The Ordinary has quickly established itself as a top 5 skin care brand in the U.S prestige beauty having improved its rank significantly over the last year. Sustainability is integral to DECIEM equity, products and retail practices, which will announce our sustainability brand portfolio and fuel the achievement of our ESG strategy and goals. We look forward to continue the exciting journey with Nicola Kilner and her incredibly talented team to realize DECIEM global opportunity. In the third quarter, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brands delivered stellar results led by strong double-digit growth in skin care, sequentially improving trends in makeup and the return to growth in fragrance. The brand is driving a renewal in the skinification on makeup trend with a significant growth of its Futurist franchise and its new Beautiful Magnolia fragrance is off to a very promising start. The Est\u00e9e Lauder skin care franchises performed exceptionally well led by Advanced Night Repair and its recently reformulated namesake serum. Revitalizing Supreme also was a standout as the launch of Supreme Bright, proved highly sought. Supreme Bright is an amazing story of east to west success. With the product born in the brightening trend in Asia, and realizing global appeals for its uneven skin tone benefits. Re-Nutriv, new eye serum surged and created a halo effect for the franchise phase in eye creams. La Mer performance was once again outstanding. The brand's worldwide success is multifaceted from both loyal and new consumers and with increase in demand from men who now represent more than 15% of sales in mainland China. La Mer's iconic product, rich storytelling, and ideal merchandising, aligned to deliver the successful journey to renewal campaign for Chinese New Year as well the brand executed a superb global campaign focused on moisturizers. The new Genaissance de La Mer, the concentrated night balm continue to spark consumer desires elevating the brand ultra luxury franchise. Clinique sales growth accelerated sequentially and rose in every region driven by its skin care portfolio. From consumers' excellent response to the new Moisture Surge in the United States to even better Clinique interrupter fueling substantial growth in mainland China to in-demand Hero franchises like Dramatically Different Moisturizing, Clinique prospered. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances realized significant growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Like skin care, fragrance offer a means to express self care and that showed through the emotional comfort of scent. We are seeing strong repeat from the emerging category in Asia Pacific. While we continue to welcome new consumers in the region. This trends in fragrance is driven by our strategic shift to the higher end is favorable to margin announcement in the category. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Kilian Paris, Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle each grew double digits. Innovation and Hero products work in harmony to fulfill consumer desires with newness from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty incredibly well received. Kilian Paris, virtual selling, which engaged founder Kilian Hennessy, influencers, and education ambassadors through live chat and shoppable live streams contributed to superb online growth. Each region grew this quarter, led by Asia Pacific, which saw sales rise in every category and many countries contributed. Mainland China was exceptional, delivering sequentially accelerated double-digit sales growth with skin care and fragrance performing ahead of the previous quarter and makeup returning to growth at double digits. Both brick-and-mortar and online thrived, driven by the strong equity of our brands, desirable innovation, high quality product leading to repeat purchase, competitive investment in advertising and investment in local talent and capabilities. For the Chinese New Year, we met the consumer where she or he chose to shop, serving the local consumer as well, the travelling consumer in Hainan, both in-store and retail to tremendous success. Online continue to be a powerful growth engine. As global sales increased strong double digits in every region. Sales of brand.com, third-party platforms and retail.com rose strong double digits, while sales of pure play grew triple-digit as we are building our consumer coverage with select pure play retailers. Our online channel is now nearly double the size it was two years ago. Importantly, the media value of brand.com continue to rise as live chat, virtual try-on and live streaming led to increased traffic and time spent on our sites. EMEA online sales increased near triple digits, while Latin America's growth was also very high. We adaptively met consumer demand in these regions, which were more pressure than others from temporary brick-and-mortar closures. In Asia Pacific and North America, where installed traffic is gradually improving in comparisons to the prior year are increasingly more difficult, online sales still grew double digits. We are innovating in the high touch online consumer experience and harnessing our data to increase engagement and drive sales. Let me share two examples from EMEA. In the United Kingdom, Clinique launched an integrated platform to deliver seamless end-to-end high touch virtual experiences with a personalized data led version of its Skin School on demand. Clinique is providing consultants with data to unlock more sophisticated recommendation with a multitude of tools to ensure the consumer experience is customized based on preferences. Consultants can now enable co-browsing and the adding of friends to services. This new platform, while still in its early days, is delivering above average conversion rates. La Mer enhanced its digital experiences with more expert classes and one-to-one consultations tailored to local consumers. The brand expanded live chat to every market in the region with a standard hours and additional days leading to incredible growth in conversion. All told, La Mer saw its regional online mix of business surge. Our brands are investing for growth with social media platform. Too Faced introduced a new virtual try-on lens on Snapchat to add to its growing portfolio of virtual try-on experiences. On TikTok, it launched a mini movie showcasing the transformative experience of Better Than Sex Mascara via its first world premiere on the platform. Dr. Jart appears color correcting treatment, targets strong online sales in the United States for the brand amplified by social selling TikTok and influencer support. Looking ahead, we are preparing a renaissance in makeup. And we anticipate that momentum will gradually build around the world, driven by local reopening and social and professional occasions. Our data and insights are driving new creativity to aspire consumers as they increase their occasion based makeup. We are strategically well-positioned to grow our sales and capture prestige beauty share in makeup recovery with our Hero products, robust innovation pipeline, analytics engine driving aspirational intelligence, an enticing in-store and online activations centered on the omni-channel consumer. Already in the third quarter newness from Clinique even better franchise in foundation and concealer was highly sought as we saw consumer restocking their core makeup products. Too Faced new Lip Plumper was a major hit. Hero products like Tom Ford Beauty eyeshadows, a mascara from Too Faced, the Bobbi Brown also performed very well. MAC is launching a new mascara, and there is exciting innovation from many brands to come. In closing, we deliver outstanding performance despite the resurging impact of the pandemic in many countries. We lead with our values as we continue to priorities the safety and well-being of our employees and consumers. We made progress on our environmental goals and acted on our social committed. We invested in accelerating drivers for sustainable growth, including innovation in China, manufacturing in Asia Pacific, global online and consumer analytics. For the long-term, we are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to create value for our stockholders. I want to say thank you to our employees who are integral to our success in making us a better company through this difficult moment. We are beautifully positioned in prestige beauty to continue drive in recovery with the house of the most dedicated and talented employees. I will now turn the call over to Tracy. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio. I certainly echo that statement and look forward to the continued progression of our recovery. For our fiscal third quarter, net sales rose 13% as we left the onset of the COVID pandemic, and delivered exceptional growth in the Asia Pacific region and in the skin care and fragrance categories. While our brick-and-mortar distribution continue to experience soft foot traffic, our online channel delivered strong growth across all formats and all regions. Conversely, the environments in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America were challenged throughout the quarter. Our gross margin increased 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter favorability and category and channel mix driven by skin care and online growth, as well as lower tester costs were partially offset by obsolescence, negative currency and COVID related under recovery of fixed cost primarily in our facilities that manufacture makeup products. Operating expenses improved by 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, largely reflecting the improved sales leverage this year. You will recall that when the pandemic struck in the prior year quarter, the sudden and dramatic drop in sales created expense deleverage that was difficult to fully offset despite the cost actions we took at that time. This quarter, we benefited from both temporary and longer term cost savings, which is reflected in the substantially lower selling and store operating costs as a percent of sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online as sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online. This was due in part to temporary store closures in response to a resurgence of the virus in certain EMEA and Latin American markets. We realize some subsidies and the extension of furlough benefits in some of the affected markets. We've also prudently managed staffing levels in our stores, and new hires on our management teams, until we see the recovery gaining more consistent momentum. Advertising spending grew double digits, and was predominantly focused on digital spending. We invested to support our online acceleration as well as our new product launches, a strong recovery in certain markets and key shopping moments such as Lunar New Year, Women's Day and Valentine's Day. As a result, our operating margin rose 620 basis points to 20.5%, which was 40 basis points above fiscal '19 level. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.7%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to a lower rate on the company's foreign operations. Diluted EPS of $1.62 increased 92% compared to the prior year. EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to the higher sales, continued cost management and a lower effective tax rate. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Year-to-date, we have taken actions in three main areas to adjust our distribution footprint in Latin America and EMEA including travel retail, to exit global distribution of BECCA products, and to realign resources and capabilities, including employee related costs between our brick-and-mortar and online channels. We are already beginning to realize the modest benefits from these actions. As the program continues, we expect to further rationalize our brick-and-mortar retail footprint, primarily in Western markets. For the 9 months, we generated $2.78 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, primarily due to higher net earnings as well as working capital improvements. We invested $386 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like production and distribution capacity and technology, including our online business. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores. We ended the period with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including cash from $600 million and senior notes issued in March to support the increased equity investment in DECIEM, once the deal was finalized. We also reinstated our share buyback program in March and utilized $316 million of cash to repurchase our stock and we paid $561 million in dividends. After the end of the quarter, we used $450 million in cash to pay down debt maturing in the fourth quarter. Given our strong cash generation this year, we still remain in a very strong position to pursue further growth opportunities after these actions. So now, let's turn to our outlook. We continue to be encouraged by the sequential improvement we have seen in our business throughout the fiscal year. And we are optimistic that restrictions and hesitancy on travel and social activities will begin to ease in certain markets as vaccine coverage steadily increases. In China, Australia, and Israel, which are at the leading edge of recovery, we are seeing higher makeup sales with usage occasions increasing as social and professional engagements gradually normalize. For example, sales in our freestanding stores in Israel have returned to pre-pandemic level and even lipstick sales are almost back to normal. The upcoming addition of the DECIEM brands to our portfolio and the expansion of our business with Sephora and Ulta beauty in the U.S. represent additional growth drivers for us as we progress in recovery from the pandemic shock, giving us further cause for optimism. We have led with our strengths, our values and our amazing team and have proactively addressed areas where which we could control while at the same time ensuring we are protecting our strategic growth areas. As a result, in the context of a very challenging environment in fiscal 2021, we expect to end the year with sales growth of between 9% and 10% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to add approximately 2 percentage points to reported growth, reflecting rates of 1.18 for the Euro, 1.33 for the pound and 6.64 for the Yuan. 6 months of incremental sales from the December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart, and approximately 1 month expected from DECIEM are contributing approximately 2 percentage points to our expectations of growth for the year. Mindful of the more gradual resumption of traffic to our brick-and-mortar distribution, we kept tight control over costs this year to protect investments needed for long-term growth. Some of the costs we cut temporarily will gradually return as more doors open, subsidies will correspondingly diminish and we plan to meaningfully ramp up advertising spending in our fourth quarter as consumers return to social and professional engagements. That said, we expect to end this fiscal year with an operating margin of approximately 18.5%, an improvement of roughly 100 basis points above fiscal 2019. Full year EPS is expected to be between $6.05 and $6.15, before restructuring and other charges. This reflects approximately $0.10 accretion from currency translation and $0.04 dilution from acquisitions. Our fourth quarter sales are expected to rise between 44% and 50% in constant currency. This reflects both the recovery in many parts of the world as well as an easier comparison against the prior year period most impacted by the pandemic. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 4 percentage points and the addition of approximately 1 month of sales from DECIEM would contribute less than 2 percentage points to sales growth. Fourth quarter EPS is expected to be between $0.38 and $0.48, reflecting the sales outlook and increased investments to support the ramp up of our innovate -- innovation and manufacturing capabilities in Asia. Continued investment to drive our online business and the advertising and promotion to support recovery, with a resulting operating margin more typical of our pre-pandemic levels of mid to high single-digit in the quarter. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS, and the addition of DECIEM is immaterial for the quarter, given the short timeframe in purchase accounting. In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter in the context of a challenging macro backdrop. Our skin care and fragrance brands have proven to be resilient during this time, as consumers shifted online and we enhanced the digital experience with increased services on our sites. As we navigate through the final months of our fiscal year, we are investing in both the near-term recovery and the drivers of long-term sustainable growth that create value for our multiple stakeholders. While it is difficult to predict the growth of global prestige beauty in the near-term, we are confident as we have demonstrated that we can nimbly allocate resources to continue to operate with agility and gain share as the recovery gives way to the new normal. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Lauren Lieberman : Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Asia Pacific because as strong as trends are, on a 2-year basis, things were a little bit slower this quarter. I know the fiscal second quarter you have 11.11 that's probably a much bigger shopping holiday than Chinese New Year. But from the aggregate level that we see in Asia, things were probably a little bit slower than people expected. So could you just give us a little bit more color there, describing maybe trends in China -- Mainland China, I should say versus whether it was Hong Kong, Japan, other areas where things might have slowed down. And also any other thoughts on Hainan and the degree to which shopping there may be overlapping with things that purchases that used to happen in other Asian markets as Chinese were travelling more overseas are now maybe repatriating those purchases to Hainan? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, sure. Let me start and then Tracey will -- perspective. The -- first of all, we believe China is super strong. I mean, we have accelerated decisively. Our reported number is 63% growth, which is almost double last quarter. So China mainland is very, very strong. Now these numbers include Dr. Jart which is a -- also a strong growing brand in Asia and now is part of our portfolio. So all good. Now, your question on Hainan, Hainan was also strong and continues to grow. And as we say, we really look and manage the Chinese consumer. So we sell to the Chinese consumers where they -- when they travel to Hainan we sell to them in their travel. And when they are in their cities, we sell to them in their cities. The opportunity of continue serving the growing middle class and the multiple smaller cities which are becoming very important for consumption from which the demand is growing continuous. And we are serving this multiple growth, meaning also there's more cities, the Tier 3, Tier 4 and the different consumer groups. We are serving these both in mainland and in Hainan when the travel in a very positive way. So China is very strong, and in our opinion will continue a very strong trend. The other thing that we seen, which is important to us in China is the recovery of makeup, because China is ahead of other regions in the control of COVID and so in people going back with more confidence to shopping also in brick-and-mortar. And we see the positive impact on that -- on the cap, which I said in my prepared remarks grew double digits. And this obviously is encouraging for what today recovery will represent also in the West as the brick-and-mortar sales go back into the new normal. The other part of your question was about Asia in total. And, yes, Hong Kong is obviously smaller than what used to be and the recovery is lower. And so Hong Kong is getting better, but it's been resized at least for the time being to what used to be. So still is a drag versus the historical levels. And Japan was definitely hit by a new wave. And there was new closures and a lot of government activity to limit shopping in brick-and-mortar any way to limit the social life activity, which means again, very big impact on makeup. And Korea, on the contrary, start the recovery, had a better quarter, and Australia had definitely a better quarter. By the way Australia is another place where its visible the recovery of makeup because of the reopening of the brick-and-mortar and more social life. So Asia was a very mixed bag. In summary, very strong China, very strong Hainan, a better Korea, a better Australia, New Zealand, and still very hard hit some of the emerging markets, Japan and Hong Kong. Tracey Travis : And you covered it, Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great, thanks. Good morning. Fabrizio, I was hoping you could share a little bit more about the renaissance of makeup you spoke to in China in particular. How is the consumer interacting with the category there? Are there new trends that they're starting to embrace? And then are they sticking with virtual try-on and some of the new ways of shopping like social selling or live streaming, and -- or do you anticipate testers or samples coming back? Just curious on some of the behavior behind that category there. Fabrizio Freda : Well, first of all, what we see is that the recovery on makeup is particularly -- benefits particularly of the recovery of brick-and-mortar omni-channel shopping because people does like to interact with the products and like the experience of shopping together. And so this is really one driver. And so in China, we see this getting stronger and as the recovery unleash. What we see in terms of product, that people -- and again, I speak about China where these active at all. Australia and Israel is another place where we see signs of what happens during the recovery. And the signs are consistent by the way. And first of all, people go back to their core makeup also because they have not used it for some time and may not be fresh anymore in some cases. So, there is a lot of back to foundation, to lipstick, to mascaras that needs to be purchased back. And now depending which region of the world, a different proportion of these subcategories as you know. But this is back to core. But there is also a huge interest in newness, is obviously that from an emotional standpoint people don't want to go back to the past. They want a new normal. They want to forget actually this very difficult year when they\u2019re in a recovery mode and go back to a new future. So they look for newness, for novelty. And that's why in our renaissance plan, we are both planning in every region of the world where and when this recovery will happen. We are ready to bring back our core and allow the consumer to reload what is their core habits, the core products. And at the same time, an outstanding mix of new product innovation, breakthrough idea, fresh way to use makeup, new looks, and most importantly, looks which are consistent with the renaissance of the user educations because to be clear, makeup is not only about shopping -- emotional shopping. It's about having the occasions in your social life, your professional life to use makeup. And so we are studying how those occasions come back and which kind of makeup core and newness is of interest for each occasions. And the occasion are different by region. And so with this level of analytics, we are preparing what we call the renaissance, which is a comeback, that is very specific. And our ability today to manage these with precisions and avoid excessive pool show, avoiding the wrong subcategories focus. In other words, ensuring a good return of our investments during the recovery. Our ability to do that has dramatically increased, thanks to analytics, which are not only giving us more data to understand what's happening but is giving us more data to anticipate what is going to happen, and that's what we are working on. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Nik Modi : Good morning. I wanted to ask about the recent new hire for the online President that you've brought in from the outside. I mean, obviously, the online business for you has done incredibly well over the last 10-plus years. And so just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of what the priorities will be for new leadership, especially given that they do have outside perspective on both CPG and retail? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, sure. First of all, Gibu is now in -- since some months and is an exceptional new lead -- new hire and a leader, well integrated by now in our organization. He will bring our online business to next level. As you said, we have done well for many years, but he is here to bring it to a completely new level. And so the priority is, first of all, to continue our growth and leverage this huge acceleration in every single channel, in brand.com, in third parties, in pure plays, in retail.com and in making sure that we have the circulation of the best practices around the world, that we learn from what's happening in every angle in -- of the world, both in our business and in what competition or retailers are doing, the third-party are doing. But I would say the center of all this is to add more technology in order to make the consumer experience in each one of these touch points really, really high quality and even more competitive. So the focus is on taking the consumer experience to the next level. You heard me speaking in the past about chats, virtual try-on, live streaming, and many other experiences that are possible but need to become better and better over time and surprise the consumer for positive. And if we do that correctly, we will continue to drive traffic to our online because we will attract traffic, not only because of our great brands, of our great innovation, but also because of our outstanding services online and because of the experience online that will be frictionless. And also, we will need to make sure that this happens in a very efficient way and in a way which is driven by technology and become consistent across the world so that we can scale it very fast every single time this is going to be needed. And finally, we -- also, one of the priorities is to make digital advertising, and particularly, all the advertise linked to eCommerce more efficient and more effective. And with these to continue to push conversion that will be one of the key challenges and the key opportunities of the next year's in the world of online. Operator : Your next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Fabrizio Freda : Hello. Dara Mohsenian : Just given the unique nature of the COVID crisis, can you just give us a bit of an update on your expectations for the travel retail category going forward? How quickly do you think demand comes back? How do you manage the business for the pace of recovery, but also potential volatility? I just love a bit of an update there. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. Our -- again, Tracey, I will let you add any perspective. But anyway, our travel retail business is up. And so is -- I would say that the recovery will be in net extra versus what is already growth. So what's happened in this field, as you all know, is that the domestic travel in general and particularly within China has been more than offsetting the lack of international travel all over the world and particularly in the west. And so in this moment, we expect the strengths that today in travel retail, in domestic travel in China with Hainan and with new centers like Shenzhen, the Greater Bay and other opportunities which are emerging over time, we expect this to continue and to remain very, very solid. But then at certain moment when international travel will be restated, then we expect international travel to bring net extra opportunities, particularly in the west where there will be obviously many more populations going back to travel. And when this will happen, we envision travel retail to be even stronger than what used to be historically and definitely stronger than today which is mainly driven by only the domestic travel part. So strong reality today, a strong future for travel retail. Now travel retail is about traffic, which what I was commenting on now, speaking about the future recovery in international travel. But it's also true about conversion, which is the percentage of travelers that buy something. So we have seen recently the conversion going up, driven by pretail. So the ability to buy online when you travel. Now, pretail is accelerating in Asia, is a very -- it's already about one-third of the business in many parts of Asia and is not yet very present or very significant in the west. So we see in the future pretail to continue to grow and to be a significant part on travel retail. And with the growth of pretail, we see the opportunity of increased growth or conversion. And in that sense, the -- these -- the traffic coming back plus conversion of travelers into buyers continue to progress, those two KPIs will represent a very solid future for travel retail. Tracey Travis : And the only thing I would add, Dara, to what Fabrizio said, we are obviously watching traffic patterns and travel patterns pretty closely. Our travel retail team is -- so international travel is really projected at this point in time not to recover until perhaps even the second half of fiscal '20 -- our fiscal '22. So again, we're watching it closely obviously. If it will recover sooner, the travel retail business internationally in terms of consumption would pick up correspondingly. But in the meantime, the travel retail team has done a fantastic job of making sure that we are managing the Western travel retail markets prudently in terms of investments until we see the recovery of traffic and consumption in the Western markets. And the only thing I -- the other thing I would say is that travel retail and online combined now are a little more than half of our total business. And so when you think about our growth momentum going forward and the recovery -- the strength that we see in online and the recovery of travel retail it bodes very well for our future growth. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for slotting me in. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Tracey Travis : Good morning, Jason. Jason English : I guess I want to -- good morning. I want to come back to, I guess, the first question where growth was a bit slower than many of us expected. And one thing that surprised me was just the sequential drop. I know that 2Q is always bigger than 3Q, but the drop down from 2Q to 3Q in terms of revenue was larger than is typical, pretty much across every region but especially Asia Pacific. So in fact one or two questions. One, was last quarter maybe a bit inflated with some retailers once again stepping back into the market reloading inventory? Or are we seeing more of a setback? I mean, I know you talked about some markets tightening down, but generally from where we sit and look globally, it looks like the world is slowly reopening and obviously not all consistent -- consistently. So help me contextualize around my head around why we would see the sequential debt? Tracey Travis : Yes. I mean, I will start, Jason. I think that what we're seeing more and more in the business particularly in Asia Pacific is more seasonality of the business. So Q2, as you indicate has become a very large quarter for us. It always was a large quarter with holiday. But with the addition of 11.11 and tremendous growth of that holiday year-over-year, we're seeing a very large sales number in our second quarter. In the third quarter, as Fabrizio mentioned, China had a very strong third quarter. We did have some large markets in Asia that were a bit softer, Japan. And I think through this pandemic, we are going to see ups and downs until things really more sustainably get back to normal when vaccine rates obviously accelerate a bit. So I would not read anything long-term into it other than this is still part of the pandemic in terms of seeing up and down performance in various markets. Similarly in terms of EMEA as well, obviously, outside of travel retail, but the Western markets in EMEA were also quite challenged in the quarter as well. So that we expect to see until, again, we see more stabilization and normalization from the pandemic. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And so frankly, I just want to underline what Tracey said. I will read in this more of a strong Q2, particularly driven by an extraordinary 11.11 where some of our brands were topped in the 11.11 project and by the fact that holidays were a moment also in the West. They were pretty positive. People were possible, they were allowed, went back to shopping, some brick-and-mortar were open. And then, maybe because these holidays where in some places were open to early, then there was a lot of closures immediately after that, Japan, U.K. Italy, part of North America, Canada. So we've got an enormous amount of closures in the January, March period, in the West particularly, and Japan, obviously. And so that's the combination. The combination is the pandemic impact on brick-and-mortar. Now, keep in mind that as you have seen in the results, we have extraordinary skin care and fragrance, and [indiscernible] brand is doing really strong. The question is the makeup recovery, and the makeup is very linked to the comeback of the brick-and-mortar experience. So all the closures that happened actually after the holidays in many Western markets and in Japan did have an impact on makeup. And we have seen that. So I would not say there is any long-term sign in this Q3. Actually, it is an extraordinarily strong Q3. By the way, it was ahead of our guidance because we had seen that in our guidance. We had seen these kinds of things that would have happened because of the closures. And so it was a very strong quarter and Q2 was just an extraordinary quarter. But as Tracey said, Q2 will be pretty strong because in the future there will be always a combination of holidays and a strong peak of commercial activities like 11.11 and more that we create a high in terms of an absolute level of sales. Tracey Travis : Operator, next question? Operator : Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Fabrizio, I guess getting going back to your comments of, skin care and fragrance have now exceeded FY '19 levels. So I was curious, as you look at makeup going forward, do you see any structural impediments in your business to get back to where makeup was pre-pandemic from a sales perspective? Fabrizio Freda : No, no, I would definitely not. I think we are counting on it, again, as the COVID abates and the opening. As I've said before, I want to repeat that, makeup is about user education. So -- and the user education on makeup at exactly the social and professional occasions that when there are closures or when the pandemic is very active and not there and so consumption goes down. So we are really -- we don't see any reason why we would not go back to first stabilization and then growth in makeup when these social occasions come back and these professional occasion comebacks. Just want to take the opportunity to make the pictures. Today, we have our current drivers, which are the Chinese consumer, the global online, and the skin care category and now the high-end fragrance category that will continue to drive. There is no discussion. These areas have been accelerated by COVID. But in reality, their trends were strong already before, so COVID does accelerated, and we are really ready and as you see we are having great success on these drivers even in the middle of COVID. Now, there are new drivers that should be added to these drivers as COVID will abate. Makeup usage, as I said, brick-and-mortar productivity in most markets, certain markets and consumer groups like U.S., U.K., Japan, continental Europe, emerging markets today are unfortunately really badly hit by COVID. We come back, and we gradually come back as the COVID improves. Younger consumer consumption, which is especially linked to makeup will come back. And the TR [ph] outside of Hainan as we said before and pretail acceleration will come back. So there are all these new drivers that we need to accelerate in the next 18 months assuming that will be the pace of return from COVID gradually. Then there are new strengths that we have built during COVID and we have invested in them. There is better innovation in Asia with the center in Shanghai and the quality of our innovation that is creating higher repeat process rates. There is more skin care and more makeup skinification and we have more production capacity of high quality production capacity in our upcoming factory in Tokyo; better consumer understanding and better ability to anticipate trends driven by our investment in analytics; more resources for advertising, especially digital advertising, which is increasing; better high touch services online, as I explained before when there was a question on online; brand portfolio, which is becoming stronger with the acquisition of DECIEM and Dr. Jart; a huge investment and acceleration in every ESG activity during COVID. And all of these combined is what I call the new strengths that we are bringing to the [indiscernible]. So the way we see it is that the current drivers will drive, the new drivers including makeup will come back and the new strengths that we have built in Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies during this year will hit. And that's why we really believe that this quarter is just the confirmation that we are creating a very solid long-term sustainable growth pattern for the company. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Tracey Travis : And the only thing I would add to that is, just to underscore some of the investment in technology we've made for virtual try-on. So when you think about those social and professional occasions coming back, whether someone wants to come in the store and try makeup or if they want to try it online, the engagement that we see online from some of the capabilities and features that we've added to online certainly bodes very well for when those occasions come back and the makeup category acceleration. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I wonder if you can just provide some comments on how you're thinking about that operating margin for fiscal '21, which I think you said was 18.4%, but correct me if I got that wrong. I mean, you noted this quarter that they're temporary but also longer term cost saving is substantially lower. Operating costs in store with the shift online, there are some subsidies in play, but you're also reallocating costs for the longer term for brick-and-mortar to online, channel mix is obviously going to be a dynamic going forward. And I guess, underlying the question is that margins continue to come through at a much higher level, channel mix is clearly an element but there are some costs that have come out permanently but also costs that are going to be coming back into the base. And so, I guess getting back to it, I wonder how you view this fiscal '21 target? Do you think that you can move up from there with all the initiatives that they have noted, or would you expect some sort of a step back as you weather some of these costs coming back into the base and channel mix evolving over the next year? Thanks so much. Tracey Travis : Yes. So, Chris, as you know we typically give forward guidance for the upcoming fiscal year in August, which we will certainly do. I mean this has been an unusual year because of all of the things that you've mentioned. We had part of the year where we had temporary salary reductions, we've had furloughs and we've also done a fantastic job, our teams have, in terms of managing costs. Some of those costs will come back next year and some of them won't. Some of the door closures that we've permanently done, those costs and the remaining fleet of doors should be more productive as traffic continues to accelerate to brick-and-mortar, which is where we see the bulk of the recovery. So given the cost actions that we've taken, given where we expect growth to come from next year disproportionately, we would expect continued margin progression. But we will be able to say more specifically what that will be in the August timeframe. But as we've said for many years, our growth areas are all margin accretive when you think about travel retail, when you think about online when you think about the strength that we've had over multiple years in terms of skin care. And as Fabrizio said, we expect skin care and fragrance to continue to grow and makeup will also grow more strongly certainly next year as those occasions come back. So we've got multiple engines, multiple ways to progress margin even as investments do come back for brick-and-mortar and in other areas. We will, in the fourth quarter as you indicate, and as I said in my prepared remarks, so -- strongly invest as we normally do for a start of a strong fiscal year and we will invest more in advertising to support what we believe will be an acceleration. It's selectively in the markets that we think that it will happen in. Chris Carey : Thanks so much for the perspective. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it over to management for closing remarks. Tracey Travis : Just thank everybody for obviously their interest in the company. And again, I think we want to thank all of our teams for the fantastic performance navigating through what has been a difficult year, but we are incredibly proud, as I mentioned and Fabrizio mentioned of our results. And certainly, we look forward to closing the year strong with the guidance that we provided. So thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. If you were unable to join the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today through May 17. To hear recording of this call, please dial 1-855-859- 2056.

Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. I hope you and your families are in good health. In our hearts, continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19. We delivered outstanding performance amid the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, capped with an exceptional fourth quarter empowered by our dynamic multiple engines of growth strategy, as well as the timeless desirability of prestige beauty. In a year of pain and sorrow, our employees cared for each other, their families, and our Company with compassion, creativity, and results. While the challenges of COVID-19 persist, we confidently begin Fiscal year 2022 as a stronger Company full of aspiration for the opportunities of tomorrow. For Fiscal Year 2021, sales rose 11%, as we pivoted our energy resources to the growth engines of skincare, fragrance, Asia-Pacific, travel retail in Asia-Pacific, and global online. Impressively, 8 brands grew double-digits, led by Estee Lauder, La Mer, and Jo Malone London. Multiple waves and variance of COVID-19 to extend the center reach were unexpected a year ago drove volatility and variability throughout the year. We saw reopening reversed to closing and reopening in one market met with renewed lockdowns in other markets. Despite this, we delivered on the goal we set last August for sales growth to improve sequentially each quarter. Our sales exceeded $16 billion for the first time ever, up 9% from Fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, fueled by skincare and fragrance. Adjusted Operating margin expanded to 18.9%, which is 140 Basis points above Fiscal year 2019. As we invested in today's strongest growth engines, managed cost with discipline and funded long-term growth opportunities. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21% relative to 2 years ago. We delivered these excellent results while pushing our social impact and sustainability goals and commitment. First and foremost, we remain focused on employee and consumer safety and well-being. We achieved important milestones for our 2025 sustainability goals, expanded our inclusion, diversity and equity programs, defined a strategy for Women's advancement and gender equality and advanced work towards our racial equity commitments. Here are a few among the many areas of our progress. We achieved net-zero carbon emissions and 100% renewable electricity globally, for our own operations. We also set science-based emissions reductions targets, addressing scope 1 and 2 for our direct operation and certain elements of scope 3 for our value chain signaling our new level of ambition for climate options. We launched ingredient [Indiscernible] for seven additional brands, such that 11 brands now offer these insightful content. We transformed our tradition inclusion, diversity and equity week into a blockbuster virtual experience with 35 events involving thousands of participants from 25 countries. We also introduced new educational offerings, including four anti-racist and inclusive leadership. We expanded our gross root to add employee resource groups, which served as a source of support and comfort throughout the turmoil of last year. The women leadership network is our largest group and is now global with it's a expansion into Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We created two new leadership programs for women and Black employees. The open door women's leadership program is a unique, intensive course to develop our next-generation of women leaders. Building on its success, we designed the open doors collection, a self-guided program to bring these leadership skills to all our employees around the world. The [Indiscernible] chair leadership and development program as successfully held to ensure that black employees have equitable access to leadership training's, mentorship, career development, and advancement opportunity, as well as to build a stronger, more inclusive network of talent across the organization by promoting visibility and facilitating leadership connections points with participants. Our new partnership with Howard University focused on its alumina, hosted 12 engaging events and launched an accelerator program to help increase the pipeline for black talent with career, coaching, professional training, and self-empowering networking. Let me now turn to product Innovation, which serve as an impossible catalysts for growth in Fiscal year 2021. Innovation represented over 30% of sales, exceeding our expectations. We combined data analytics with our creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate, scale and set trends across categories. The Estee Lauder brand achieved its fourth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2021, fueled by strength across its many hero franchises in skin care. Trusted products along with innovation were highly sold from Shanghai to New York, Paris, and now Sao Paolo, given the brand's well-received launch in Brazil. Advanced Night Repair newly preformulated serum sparked excellent sales growth. Revitalizing Supremes\u2019, New Supreme Bright moisturizer further bolstered the accelerating franchise, while the Nutriv new eye serum served and created a halo effect on demand. In makeup, the brand's double wear, futurist and pure Clorox franchises produced significant double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. An exciting early signs of makeup river source. La Mer delivered outstanding double-digit Sales growth in the fiscal year. As innovation sort an engaging campaigns with iconic ingredient base narratives drove demand for its hero products.

In May, we amplified the strength of our skincare Portfolio as we became majority owner of DECIEM with its coveted ingredient base brand, the ordinary, an emerging science driven neared brand as part of its Portfolio. Complementing skincare strengths, fragrance delivered striking sequential sales growth acceleration throughout the year. Each of our luxury and artisanal fragrance brand contributed meaningfully from Jo Malone, London to Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frederic Malle. In both established fragrance markets of the west and emerging fragrance market of the East, Tom Ford Beauty's Private Blend franchise is both recruiting new consumers and driving stronger tips in marketing newly embracing the category with the brand's dragon Sales more than doubling in Mainland China during the year. The Asia-Pacific region was another dynamic growth engine in Fiscal Year 2021. Its annual sales growth accelerated from 18% to 22%, led by Mainland China where sales rose strong double digits. Korea grew organically. Several smaller markets also contributed to Asia-Pacific strength. The region, however, experienced increasing pressure from the pandemic as the year evolved, with Japan and many markets in Southeast Asia particularly impacted from renewed lockdowns in the second half. Mainland China prospered, as we invested in its vibrancy of today and opportunity of tomorrow. We entered more cities, reaching 145, expanded our presence specialty multi, opened freestanding doors and increased our advertising spending. Skincare fragrance sales grew strong double-digit for the Fiscal year. We are encouraged that the makeup accelerated to double-digit sales growth in the second half, our brands delivered excellent results for the key events of T-Mobile's 1111 global shopping festival and 618 mid-year shopping festival as engaging live streaming generated product discovery for many new consumers. For the recent 618, among Tmall Beauty Flagship Stores, the Estee Lauder brand ranked number 1 in Total Beauty, while La Mer ranked 1st in Luxury Beauty, and Jo Malone London led the fragrance category. To further capture the market recent online growth opportunity, we are continuing to invest in Tmall and brand.com to expand our capabilities. Most recently, some brands increased coverage of a different demographics by launching already in July. With international travel, larger curtailed, we expanded our investment in the dynamic Travel retail development of Hainan highland to serve the Chinese consumers in the best possible way, given the island's tremendous traffic growth in higher duty-free purchase limits. Our brands further elevated the installed and prepaid shopping experiences, delivered ideal merchandising, and leveraged live streaming to drive strong sales growth. Looking at channels, online thrived globally in fiscal year 2021 characterized by strong double-digit sales gains and step change in its power as a growth engine. We accelerated our consumer-facing digital infrastructure and fulfillment investments. The challenge is now more than twice as big as it was two years ago and greatly benefit from its diversification as each of brand.com, third-party platforms, retail.com and [Indiscernible] of retailers delivered outstanding performance. During the year, brand.com came to epitomize their lure of a luxury flack sheet store for each brands localized by market and re-imagined with our classic High-Touch services. We expanded virtual trainer, live-streaming, omnichannel capabilities and consultations with our expert beauty advisors. Consumers are all ages.

Beyond the favorable growth rates, the data relationship with Frosted with consumers enabled us to better optimize engagement in-store and online, offering exciting future growth opportunities. We are investing across all channels of online, collaborating with traditional and pure-play retailers on initiatives to actualize Prestige Beauty online potential. We spoke on the last call about heading expanded our presence with Tour Player retailers, which continued into the Fourth Quarter, most especially in EMEA. And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we are expanding our consumer coverage in Mainland China. For Fiscal Year 2022, we expect these growth engines of Skincare, Fragrance Asia-Pacific, Travel Retail Asia-Pacific, and Global Online to continue to try, owing to our strong repeat purchase rates, sophisticated data analytics -derived consumer acquisitions, and retention. high-touch online services, and robust innovation pipeline. Three compelling skincare innovation recently launched.

In reaching our capability in product design, formulation, consumer insight, and trend analytics for Chinese and Asian consumers. Also, with the new center, our East to West innovation will benefit, enabling us to create more successes like Estee Lauder futurist Hydra or Supreme Bright, and La Mer, the treatment lotion. As the world emerged from the pandemic, we will be the best diversified pure-play in prestige beauty as more engines of growth contribute across categories, geographies, and channels. Makeup and hair care are poised to gradually reignite as growth engines. As our developed markets in the West in Brick-and-mortar retail. Growth in emerging markets is expected to resume over time as vaccination rates increase. We anticipate the momentum in makeup will build around the world driven by local reopening, an increasing social and professional user education, just as we saw in the fourth quarter. Indeed, makeups started to improve to the end of Fiscal year 2021, driven by our Hero of sub-categories of foundation and mascara. Newness in the category was highly sold, evidenced by the success of MAC magic extension Mascara to face Lip Plumper, Smashbox hollowed, tinted moisturizers, and Bobbi Brown sheer pressie power contributing to makeup emerging Renaissance, MAC launched MAC The Moment.

Aveda, which is now 100% vegan and Bumble and bumble enter fiscal year 2022 with momentum owing to desirable innovation and reached consumer engagement for strong online performance globally over the past year. As makeup and hair care vein yard, we expect our engines of growth will gradually diversify by geography and channel, initially driven by developed markets in the west and over time by emerging markets in the U.S., the Fourth Quarter, we aligned innovation, advertised spending and store activations as consumer returned to stores, eager to explore beauty and steer in high-touch services. Across brick-and-mortar from regional and national department stores to specialty [inaudible] and freestanding stores, our business in the U.S. prospered, most especially in makeup and fragrance, and exceeded our expectations.

This year, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary as a Company and beginning our next 75 years, incredibly inspired by the opportunities of tomorrow as the leading global house of prestige beauty with the most talented employees, to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you for [Indiscernible] and hello, everyone. I concur with Fabrizio in thanking our incredible team who have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic. Navigating through the highly uneven recovery this past year has certainly required greater agility and flexibility and our teams across the globe rose to the occasion, delivering superb results for the Fiscal year, while also establishing a stronger foundation for future growth and profitability. We delivered exceptional net sales growth of 56% in our fourth quarter as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures in the prior year. The inclusion of six weeks of sales from DECIEM added approximately three points to growth in the quarter. Our performance also exceeded the pre-pandemic levels of the Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter by 9% driven by significant sales increases in Mainland China, the skincare and fragrance categories, global online, and travel retail in Asia. All three regions grew and all product categories within each region grew during the Quarter. Net sales in the Americas region rose 86% against the prior-year period with almost no brick-and-mortar retail open. Throughout the quarter, consumer confidence in the U.S. grew as COVID restrictions abated and people resume shopping in stores again. Our brands responded with strong program supporting recovery, new product launches, and animating key brand shopping events like Mother's Day. Sales in the region remained below Fiscal '19 level for the quarter, reflecting in part the loss of over 900 retail locations that represented nearly 170 million in annual sales. Additionally, makeup has historically been the largest category in the region, and the category has yet to fully recouped sales loss during the pandemic. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the sequential acceleration in North American sales, which has been better than we expected. Net Sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region increased 65% with all markets contributing to growth as COVID restrictions eased throughout the Quarter. Global Travel Retail, which is primarily reported in this region, continued to suffer from a significant drop in international travel traffic, but grew strong double-digits in the Quarter as comparisons eased and local tourism in China, especially to Hainan remained robust. Across developed markets in the region, store traffic has begun to pick up and retailers have become more comfortable with restocking. Emerging markets in the region saw strong retail in the Quarter, driven by locally relevant holiday activation, retailer events, and online performance. Sales in the region were slightly above Fiscal '19 levels for the Quarter, primarily due to the resilience of travel retail. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 30%. Virtually every country contributed to growth, although the pace of improvement varied widely among the markets and a resurgence of COVID has slowed a full recovery. Sales of our products online continued to rise strong double-digit in the region driven by the successful 618 Shopping Festival campaign in China and including the continued strength of social e-commerce. Mainland China continued to experience robust double-digit growth with broad-based improvement across product categories, brands and channels. Other markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and Japan grew exceptionally against prior year Brick-and-mortar lockdown. Sales in the region were 50% above 2019 levels, largely reflecting China's rapid emergence from the pandemic last year. Net sales in all product categories grew sharply this quarter. And skin care, fragrance and hair care drove higher sales than Fiscal 2019. Fragrance-led growth with net sales rising 150% versus prior-year. Luxury fragrances resonated with consumers looking for self-care and indulgence and among Chinese consumers, increasingly attracted to the category. Home, bath, and body products have also gained traction during the pandemic and helped to attract new consumers. Jo Malone London saw recovery to pre-pandemic levels in Brick-and-mortar. And the brands Blossom and Brit collections were popular in Asia. Standouts from Tom Ford Beauty include the recent launch of Tubereuse Nue and the continued strength of Bitter Peach and Rose Prick. Net sales in makeup jumped 70% against the prior year that reflected the greatest beauty category impact of COVID-19, particularly in western markets, where makeup is the largest category. The makeup category in prestige beauty has proven to be especially sensitive to brick-and-mortar recovery due to the use of testers and in-store services by consumers. Estee Lauder saw strong growth of Futurist and Double Wear foundations in Asia, and MAC liquid lip colour and eye products, especially mascara, outperformed. Haircare net sales grew 52% as salons and stores reopened. The launch of Aveda's Blonde Revival Shampoo and Conditioner also contributed to category growth. Adding to other strong innovation programs over the past several months from Aveda. Net sales in skincare continued to thrive. They rose 42% in the quarter driven by strong increases from the La Mer Estee Lauder, Clinique and [Indiscernible] with its brands, particularly in Asia. Skincare sales growth also benefited from the addition of DECIEM in the quarter by approximately 4% points. Our Gross margin improved 650 Basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. This favorability reflected significant improvements in obsolescence and manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior year impact of COVID-19 on our Sales and on our manufacturing locations. Operating expenses rose 36% driven by the planned increase in advertising and selling costs to support the reopening of retail and the recovery. Additionally, we sharply curtailed spending last year in response to the onset of the pandemic and some of these costs were reinstated, primarily compensation. We delivered operating income of 385 million for the Quarter compared to a $228 million operating loss in the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 included $0.02 of favorable currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Our full-year results reflect the benefits of our strategic focus as we leaned into current growth drivers and invested behind future areas of growth, while effectively managing both costs and cash. The sequential acceleration of our business throughout the year culminated in net sales growth of 11%. The strength of Chinese consumer demand, both at home and in travel retail, the resilience of the skincare and fragrance categories, and the momentum we drove in our online channels, all supported our growth. Our distribution mix continued to revolve even as Brick-and-mortar reopened. Sales of our products through all online channels continued to thrive as they rose 34% for the year and represented 28% of Sales. Despite the continued curtailment of international travel, our business in the Travel retail channel grew ending Fiscal 2021 at 29% of Sales. Among Brick-and-mortar retail, specialty multi and perfumeries grew while department stores and freestanding stores experienced the greatest impact from the ongoing pandemic and declined for the year. Our Gross margin rose 120 Basis points to 76.4% driven by favorable pricing, lower obsolescence, increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs for testers and stores and partially offset by currency due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses declined 300 Basis points to 57.5% of sales. Selling and store operating costs decreased as high service stores were either closed for part of the year or they reopened with reduced traffic and staffing levels. Additionally, in-store merchandising costs decreased while advertising investments, primarily Digital media, rose faster than Sales to support our brands in the recovery. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including Leading Beauty Forward and the preliminary benefits from the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program. And this gave us the flexibility to reinvest in necessary capabilities, absorbed some of the inflation and media and logistics costs, as well as support the reinstatement of certain compensation elements that were reduced or frozen due to the onset of the pandemic. Our full-year Operating margin was 18.9%. representing a 420 basis-point improvement over last year and 140 basis points above Fiscal 2019. This year also includes 50 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 18.7%, a decrease of 450 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings, which included a favorable one-time adjustment for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2020 related to recently issued GILTI Tax Regulation s. Net earnings rose 57% to $2.4 billion and diluted EPS increased 57% to $6.45. Earnings per share includes $0.11 accretion from currency translation and $0.08 dilution from the acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. In Fiscal 2021, we recorded 148 million after-tax or $0.40 per share of impairment charges related to our Smashbox and GLAMGLOW brands, as well as certain freestanding retail stores. Restructuring and other charges related primarily to the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program, were 176 million after-tax or $0.48 per share. These charges were more than offset by the one-time gain on our minority interest in DECIEM of 847 million after-tax or $2.30 per share. The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is progressing quickly with projects underway across all regions. We have closed nearly 500 doors or counters, including about 50 freestanding stores under the program in Fiscal 2021. We also closed approximately 100 additional freestanding stores outside of the program and upon lease expiration, primarily in North America and in Europe. We've realigned our go-to-market organizations to better reflect our evolving channel mix. We're also winding down certain brands such as BECCA and Rodan. These actions are expected to continue into Fiscal 2022. For the total program, we continue to expect to take charges of between 400 million and 500 million through Fiscal 2022 and generate savings of 300 to 400 million before tax by Fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested. We continue to focus on maintaining strong liquidity while also investing for future growth during the year. Cash generated from operations rose 59% to $3.6 billion were primarily reflecting the higher net earnings. We utilized 637 million for Capital improvements, supporting increased capacity and other supply chain improvements, further e-commerce development and information technology. We repaid 750 million of Debt outstanding from our revolving credit facility, issued 600 million of new long-term Debt and retired 450 million of Debt. We used 1.1 billion net of cash acquired to increase our ownership interest in DECIEM. And we returned 1.5 billion in cash to Stakeholders during the year via increased Dividends and the reinstatement of share repurchase activities in the second half of the Fiscal year. So looking ahead to Fiscal 2022, we are encouraged by the increasing vaccination rates and reopening of markets around the world. We look forward to the resumption of international travel, increasing foot traffic and Brick-and-mortar retail and the development of our recent acquisitions. We are still mindful, however, that the recovery has evolved unevenly and some markets are seeing their third or fourth waves of COVID, including increasing effects of new more contagious strains of the virus, hindering a return to normal life. This has been particularly evident in the U.S. over the past several weeks. Additionally, increasing climate and geopolitical events make it difficult to predict the corresponding impact on our business. Nevertheless, given the strength of our programs, we are cautiously optimistic and therefore providing a range of sales and EPS expectations for the Fiscal year caveated with the following underlying assumptions. Progressive recovery in the makeup category as full vaccination rates increase and mass wearing abates in western markets during the first half of the Fiscal year. Beginning of the resumption of international travel in the second half of the Fiscal year. The addition of new retail accounts for some of our brands should provide broader access to new consumers, notably through Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta at Target in North America and the addition of JD.com in China online. The inclusion of incremental sales from DECIEM, benefiting sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily in the Americas and AMEA region and in the skincare category. Pricing is expected to add approximately 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflation risk and freight, media, labor, and commodities. Increased advertising support as markets reopen and further investment behind select capabilities, including data analytics, innovation, technology, and sustainability initiatives while maintaining good cost discipline elsewhere. We forecast increasing benefits from our post - COVID business acceleration program as it ramps up this year. Approximately, 200 million of the cost we cut during the pandemic are expected to be reinstated. These primarily include hiring, travel and meeting expenses, furloughs and other leaves of absence, and compensation. In addition to these assumptions, there are a few non-operating items you should be aware of as you adjust your models. Our full-year effective tax rate is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately 23% from 18.7% in Fiscal 2021. Net interest and investment expense is expected to be around $150 million. The increase is primarily due to the comparison to last year when we recorded the benefits of our minority interest in DECIEM through May 18th 2021. At that time, we acquired a majority ownership in DECIEM and we began to fully consolidate the entire business and deduct a portion of the income we don't own as a charge to net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest. This charge is expected to be less than $5 million in Fiscal 2022. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecast between $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of projected Sales. As we develop additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, notably for the building of our new facility in Japan. We also expect to fund more robust research and development capabilities in China and North America. Increased investment in technology and support new distribution and e-commerce for our brands. Our Capex plan for the year also includes some spending differed from last year. Also, beginning in Fiscal 2022, we plan to entry -- introduce the concept of organic sales growth in our earnings materials and investor presentations, organic growth, adjust reported sales growth for both currency and changes in structure, such as acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures. This should help provide a more meaningful understanding of the performance of our comparable business. Additionally, reflecting the level of volatility still in the environment, we are at this point widening our guidance ranges for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12% based on August 13 spot rates of 1.17 for the Euro, 1.381 for the Pound, 1164 for the Korean Won and 6.479 for the Chinese Yuan. We expect currency translation to add one point to reported Sales growth for the full Fiscal year. As I mentioned earlier, this range excludes approximately three points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily, the inclusion of DECIEM theme. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.19 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 12%. This also includes approximately $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to rise 11% to 13%. The incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth and currency is expected to be accretive by approximately three points. Operating expenses are expected to rise in the First Quarter as we invest in the reopening and recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world and some of the temporary cost measures start to ease. We expect First Quarter EPS of a $1.55 to a $1.65. Currency is expected to be accretive to EPS by $0.05 and DECIEM is forecast to have no impact. In closing, while we're cautious about the uneven recovery to date, we remain confident about the strategic actions we continue to take to support sustainable, profitable growth post-pandemic, and the agility we have demonstrated this past year. On behalf of the entire Estee Lauder Company's leadership team, we give thanks to our incredible teams around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning, guys. Tracey Travis : Hi, Dara. Fabrizio Freda : Good morning. Dara Mohsenian : Can you give us an update on how much of the incremental e-commerce business and new customers you obtained during COVID are proving sticky now that we fully cycle COVID and perhaps also just give us a sense for expectations for e-commerce sales, growth in Fiscal '22 and how you sort of think about that versus a COVID boost.  And then longer term, can you also spend some time just discussing how you're better using or upgrading technology to drive e-commerce sales longer-term. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : So, let me start is -- first of all, I would say the large majority of our online progress during COVID is very sticky. And keep in mind that we attracted also many new consumer. The new consumer were also among the older consumers, and they really liked it.  And so, we see they're coming back and they're staying, even when store reopens, obviously, with a different balance, but this is definitely happening. But then in total, our online is continuing to grow and we expect this to continue to grow from many years to come and the trend will not stop after COVID.  Also, our online mix, which is 3PP in China for example which as you heard from the prepared remarks, flying the our last 18/6 event was really strong and then retail.com that for many retailers around the world is booming to a play, which is very much growing and then brand.com and obviously brand.com in the moment -- the part of brand.com in the moment that is the bigger reopening and people go back to store will temporarily stabilize or slightly decrease. But then will start growing again. That's our expectations. So overall, all-in-all our online business will continue to progress as percentage of total business over the next years. Tracey Travis : And keep in mind Dara. We also explained in our prepared remarks that we do have some new customers. So retailer.com should pick up as well with the U.S. expansion of Ulta into Target and Sephora into Kohl's and the same with JD in China. So again, we've got -- as Fabrizio said, very strong plans for online again, this year.  And -- and I expected that it will -- again increase as a percent of our penetration of Sales. As it relates to technology, we are investing quite a bit in our e-commerce platform to enable capabilities, many of which we have spoken about, whether it's virtual try-on. Our data analytics that -- that certainly support our being able to more personalized experiences for -- for consumers and many other -- many other capabilities. And beyond -- beyond online where we continue to invest in the consumer experience in our stores and in other areas as well. So we do have a robust technology investment plan that I would expect to continue over the next couple of years.  We're also investing in new technology in our new facility in -- that is opening in a couple of years in Japan. And it will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, so it will leverage quite a bit of technology also. Dara Mohsenian : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit more about Asia-Pacific and the improvements there? And if you could talk about the drivers there? You mentioned the strength of 618.  So, should we expect more quarterly variability in Asia, whether because of 618 or 11.11, and how that could influence how the year develops? And then if you could just talk a little bit about the current trends, given another uptake in volatility [Indiscernible] with the pandemic? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : There is very -- very big strengths in Asia-Pacifics that we will continue in the long term. Obviously, as we said in the prepared remarks, there has been some pandemic issues and we're down in places like Japan, on some parts to Southeast Asia, which become an obstacle to these. So it's a temporary obstacle to this growth in these specific markets. But, overall, Asia-Pacific will continue to be very strong and will be led by China.  Who's progress will continue to develop in our opinion and also that's what's happening so far. Now, the -- what we call variability of Sales, meaning ups and downs to Sales in Asia-Pacific, particularly in China, Frankly, is more about seasonality.  And there is a clear seasonality like the reason that use like the Visa in Europe and there are holiday moments and Chinese New Year moments, moments where the Chinese population travel, moments in which they are more home, moment where there festivities and there are moments of the year with certain progress, particularly skincare is more used than others. Obviously, there is important elements of seasonality. Now, the good news we're completely on top of those. We manage seasonality with anticipation. And that's why our quarter-by-quarter a year programs are pretty well, articulate and reconnaissance consumer seasonality and trade proportionality period in a very accurate way at this point of time. So this is a leverage point rather than an issue that's why I would not call it variability, but rather seasonality. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I will start with the discussion of 3% contribution from pricing in '22. I know there's always some pricing in the business and it's somewhat subtle based on the consumer standpoint, but 3% just sounded higher than usual to me.  So, curious if it's more centered in categories and brands, are there areas where you just like the momentum is so strong that it's not an untapped opportunity or is this more in response to the broadly inflationary environment? Tracey Travis : Well, as you mentioned, Lauren, we take pricing every year, usually in the 2% to 2.5% range. We are taking approximately 3% of pricing this year and yes, it is certainly considering the inflationary environment that we're operating in.  We do take differential pricing, so that it is an average across all of our markets, all of our brands. And -- and -- and but -- but so there's no specific category that we're taking any more pricing and -- then others. But -- but it is tiered certainly by the tearing of our -- of our brand Portfolio. Fabrizio Freda : And I just want to add, we do have the ability to price, where there is the opportunity. And because of our loyalty [Indiscernible] levels, etcetera, obviously in certain markets with spaces. And so we are planning because of the current [Indiscernible] environment, as you said, to take about 0.5 point more prices that in the previous years, and this is completely justified.  And these combined with our cost-saving programs, which should allow us to manage the inflation without any negative impact, neither of our advertising nor on our profitability. And that's our plan. The other thing I want to say about our flexibility on pricing is that with the kind of success we had with innovation, in the kind of very attractiveness of our Innovation that can command luxury pricing very easily because of the great, great quality that we are deploying to the consumers.  And the moment you are between 20%, 30% every year of this coming from innovation, you can imagine that we can decide the pricing of 20%, 30% every year based also on our -- our intent, on the power of our Innovation. So this is a next to our flexibility that we have in terms of managing pricing over the years. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. Just two questions. If I can just a quick follow-up on the China. We're reading a little bit about government actions in terms of cracking down on wealth-flaunting luxury, particularly in social media. And so I just wanted to be -- make sure that that's not something that you see affecting your business. And then my deeper question is if you could give us an update on the e-commerce in the U.S. as a percent of sales and how that breaks out between your direct brand.com business and the retailer.com business and any changes in trends there that you're seeing? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : And sorry, could you repeat the one on the U.S.? Tracey Travis : The.com. Robert Ottenstein : Just -- just an update on the.com business in the U.S., the percent of Sales, I think it's -- was running 40% and then how that's breaking out between the direct business and the retail.com. Fabrizio Freda : Okay, starting with China and -- Robert Ottenstein : No, we don't see any issue on China potential in our industry on our last improvement, what you're saying. Fabrizio Freda : Actually we see a lot of support to the trend and a lot of interest in our products as the middle class evolves. And we see also given, for example, all the government actions that have been taken to support the development of Hainan and the duty-free line, and there is obviously an interest in supporting internal consumption and somehow, our industry is benefiting from the interest in being the creation of internal consumption and also bringing the consumption in the past was outside more internally.  So, it's all of a positive trend. The other thing, when you speak about luxury, just want to say, we are really affordable actually, in the sense that our products are luxury within the beauty category, but they're very affordable purchases in the context of total luxury.  So, we don't see any negative at this point in time on this front, on the contrary, very strong support for the long-term. Going into the internal online development in the U.S., I'll turn this to Tracey for your specific question on the percentages. Tracey Travis : Yeah. In terms of the online percentage we ended last year a little over 40% online. Again, as you know, we started the year with some of our Brick-and-mortar doors actually closed. So very, very strong online penetration. And as Brick-and-mortar reopened, the online penetration lessened a bit, but we did end the year at about 40%. In terms of the retailer.com versus brand.com, we are seeing -- and it varies.  So we saw quite a bit of strength in retailer.com towards the second half of the year and strengthen -- and brand.com earlier in the year. And this year, obviously, we have some very strong plans for both brand.com and retailer.com in the U.S. to continue to grow. Robert Ottenstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Steve Powers, Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Thanks and good morning. I was hoping you would just elaborate a bit further on what you're doing to best position your portfolio to take advantage of the anticipated recovery in makeup and to what degree you see your businesses likely to accrue net share gains alongside that recovery? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So we -- we -- we are preparing for the makeup brand source and we are working on all our makeup brands and in all our regions to leverage these as user education comes back. The prove that what was exactly happening in the U.S. in this last Quarter is very encouraging. In the last Quarter, our makeup was extraordinarily strong. For example, in countries where the world's have a recovery growth, like the U.S. and we saw great results from MAC onto phase and to many other brands.  And we saw, particularly, the recovery start s from foundation and lipsticks, which is very good news, a very good sign. So what we're doing is first of all, we are preparing programs, marketing programs, and innovation programs and new launches for every market, making sure that we timed those to the expected recovery trend.  That would be gradual but we will be -- as you know, we'll be dependent on vaccination levels and on the ability to control the COVID spikes where this happens. And so we have all analytics that tell us when this timing could be in different parts of the world. We time our marketing the auction, our advertising relaunch auctions, our innovation auctions to the different expected recovery moments.  So it's a pretty complex elaboration or plan, but it's very effective. And so far has given us the kind of results we wanted, but most importantly, the kind of return on the investment that we wanted when you time it correctly. The second thing that we're doing obviously is making sure that we use data analytics and we use the understanding of the consumers to really tailor it to where the trend will start, and this is set by makeup subcategories.  There are very different priorities that the consumer choose in coming back to makeup when the [Indiscernible]. And so we have some outstanding new capability in analytics that drive us also in maximum effectiveness in these areas.  So, in -- all-in-all, we are very, very encouraged by the early recovery in the countries where this happened, which are mainly U.S., China, and we are well organized to follow up on the recovering gradually in the course of 2022. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Wissink with [Indiscernible]. Grace Ong : Hi, good morning. This is Grace Ong for Steph. I wanted to dig in a little on the Travel retail recovery that you're expecting and how you think about the growth in market locations like Hainan. Would you expect that Hainan continues to grow on international travel resumes or is there a re-balancing where the demand is realized? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. First of all, we expect Hainan to continue to grow in the future and we expect Hainan success to be relatively independent from the comeback to international travel. Let me explain that; if you put in the number of Chinese consumers that have a passport, which is above 10% evolving towards 15%, from the information which are available and you assume they don't get percentage of those consumer with the past travel internationally in a given year, you immediately see that the international travel is going to create consumption that is a certain percentage of the Chinese population. Hainan is domestic travel, so is open to 100% of the Chinese middle class that wants to travel and is traveling as we speak. So the Hainan phenomenon is basically -- goes well beyond international travel because it is domestic travel and appeals 100% of the population. That's why we believe that Hainan is here to stay and is a great opportunity for the long-term term that will continue to growth even when international travel will restart.  As far as the international travel question. We are assuming that some international travel will gradually restart in the second semester of our '22 Fiscal year. And these obviously, this is an assumption, nobody knows and will depend not only will from the pandemic development, will depend also from the government decisions on how to manage the various rules around the management of the pandemic.  So is -- we can only go with estimates, but that's what we're currently estimating. And we have seen already signs for example, in summer in Europe, we're seeing some new travel, some new movements and some increase, but obviously relatively still very much below what was before COVID. And then in Fiscal Year 2023, we assume there will be a more robust international travel acceleration. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and morning everyone. Wanted to ask a bit of a follow-up on China and just maybe talk a bit about what's embedded in your -- your expectations just overall for the business, for that country for Fiscal '22? And it may be in the context of things that we've seen around slowing sales on Tmall and discuss the commentary about expanding on JD and just how does that fit in when you talk about different demographics? So, if you could elaborate a bit on what you're hoping to accomplish that would be helpful? Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So we -- we -- we expect the -- the market in China to continue to grow double-digit. And we're very, very optimistic on the strengths of this market, as well as on -- on our position with the consumers in this market. We -- we expect to see a continuous acceleration of online, which is already 50% of Mainland China business today and farther growing. We see the possibility of continued growth in the existing platforms, like Tmall, which is for us, for beauty, for our brands, very successful and a great partners that we will continue to develop and manage with also specific products of specific brands -- of specific new brands in the future.  And then we see an acceleration of brand.com. And in the marketing models around the brand.com in which we are investing and also improving our technologies to keep it aligned with the extraordinary development of technology in China, and the ability to make this technology very appealing to the consumers.  And so we keep learning and keep evolving in this area. And then there are certain brands that are appealing to certain demographics that also decided to expand [Indiscernible], and just now in July. And so very optimistic with also the results of these increased coverage of consumers that we're getting.  And there would be more opportunity in the future is a very, very dynamic market and competitive market, which keeps evolving and our principal is always to stay ahead of devolution, which admittedly is not easy in such a demanding market. But we're trying to stay always ahead of the evolution and anticipate change.  And we'd get helped in this by our extraordinary Chinese leadership team, that keep us braced around what's happening and help us anticipating all the trends. And we get helped by our compass that we discussed in our time, which gives us a good, good point of view on what will be the evolution in the consumer preferences in every market, but particularly in China. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks. Good morning. My question is for Tracey. If you could talk a little bit more about what you expect for the Sales and the profitability of rebound in the North American segment in Fiscal 2022.  Particularly when you're kind of layering on some of the new distribution partnerships, both Kohl's and Sephora and Ulta Target. And then I do have a follow-up Fabrizio on DECIEM. I know that ordinary has been driving the large success to date, but they do have a number of other brands in their Portfolio? So curious on your plans to scale some of them. Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay. Let me start with North America. We're very optimistic, given the trends that we saw in the Fourth Quarter and that are continuing into the First Quarter as it relates to North America. So, people are coming back to stores. People are still shopping online and certainly, the new retail partnerships of our retail partners, we are expecting, will also contribute to growth this year. But across the board, the team has really been working on a terrific innovation. We're increasing advertising in North America in Fiscal 2022, so we expect both top-line growth and margin expansion in North America related to our strategies in 2022. Fabrizio Freda : And on these, you are absolutely right. DECIEM is a Company with an extraordinary Portfolio brands. The Ordinary is today, the biggest, and is continued to be very successful in growing as an extraordinary brand. But our other brand light [Indiscernible], which is more science-based, that we intend with the DECIEM team to continue to develop.  And also DECIEM is adding twice that of the Company, the capability of an extraordinary incubation, [Indiscernible], and ability. So we definitely intend to continue incubate new brands, develop new ideas, and continue with the days and philosophy of the challenge of the status quo and seeing new different point of views to be offered to the consumers and develop the extraordinary new brands in the long-term.  But in this moment, the opportunity for the ordinary to continue to grow -- to continue to expand is frankly amazing and is obviously the priority we are focusing on in fiscal year 2022. Erinn Murphy : Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question is going to be from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on disclosure around travel retail being 29% of Fiscal '21 Sales. Can you just confirm that? And then that would imply that you had a pretty big acceleration in Q4 in the Travel retail business. And then does that mean that the continental Europe business declined in the quarter?  So any -- just any clarification just around that. And then just longer-term this decision to partner with Ulta and Target, support Coles, this is really an expansion of distribution throughout [Indiscernible] some channels where you've been less comfortable going in the past, but there's just more of a -- these brands are being curated in a different setting, what are your thoughts on that in other channels, say Amazon or other online forums over time? So thanks so much for those. Tracey Travis : So -- so I can confirm Travel retail in terms of the percent of mix at -- at 29% on it -- we did have strong growth and travel retail in the fourth quarter. And in terms of the AMEA region, we did see growth as well in the AMEA region excluding -- excluding Travel retail, the UK was a little challenge. But -- but as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, all our regions grew in the fourth quarter Fabrizio Freda : And the other thing I want to say on Travel retail on the long term, as I said, is the -- travel retail as these addition of the domestic travel in China, which is a very important additions. And so the development of the business with the Chinese consumers is extraordinary and then the Chinese consumer depending on the period of the year or their choice is some of them would travel to Hainan by there others would buy in the cities, and so you would see these expanding growth of the Chinese consumers in the China region or in the travel retail Hainan depending on what the Chinese consumer decide to do. Our strategy is very simple. We are going to serve the growing demand of Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop. And so, we are aligned, we are in the outstanding quality department stores in China, we are in Hainan, and in all these areas, where they shop, we tend to be present with outstanding execution, great luxury, quality of services, and to really give justice to our elevated luxury positioning in these positions.  And that's the strategy to cover the Chinese consumer shopping. And as far as the -- when, when the international traveling will restart, we'll obviously also cover the international travels in the best possible way. In term of your second part of the question is -- I would like to clarify one thing. I think Fiscal Year 2021 was an extraordinary year to build our luxury position and to elevate our consumers pressure in a very luxury way.  If you think that the core investment that we have done is being in elevating the brand building, the luxury experience online. And that we have been able to bring online a lot of the luxury speed and services than the past we're only in the best department stores or in the best Brick-and-mortar locations. So these now means that we have elevated to the best possible experience about 30% of our business. Then, as I explained, our best expression of luxury is frankly in TR. It's being for a -- since a long time, particularly in the best airports of the world, but now is in Hainan, where there is the best expression of the brands in the world, and as you said, is another 29%. So we have elevated our luxury expression in more than 60% of our business around the world.  And that's the key areas to where we invested. We have also taken the opportunity, where there is the opportunity to source from mass and to continue growing the prestige segment, to bring some of our brands to have the power of sourcing from mass clues to where the mass consumers are choosing to shop and wants to have the opportunity to upgrade to different quality. And that's where some opportunities like the Ulta Target and Sephora Kohl's offer us the opportunity to further source from mass, and further serve more consumers and consumer that we didn't access before with our best experience at best quality products. Operator : Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions and answers with Ben. I would like to conclude the Q and A portion of today's call.

For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the floor over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin. Laraine Mancini : Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.  As a reminder, references to online sales include sales that we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. [Operator Instructions]. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our first quarter results, revised outlook for fiscal year 2024 and accelerated profit recovery plan to benefit fiscal year 2025 and 2026.  Before we begin, I want to start by expressing the tremendous grief and sadness we have for the victims and their families of the horrific terrorist attacks against Israel, the tragic loss of Palestinian lives and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Our hearts break for the profound suffering across the Middle East during this terrible time. We are committed to continuing to support the safety and well-being of all our employees in the affected areas and around the world. Let me now turn to our first quarter results. We delivered our outlook for organic sales and exceeded the expectation for adjusted diluted EPS. Organic sales decreased 11%. Our global travel retail business drove the decline, as expected, with organic sales lower by 51% given the combination of trade inventory reduction and a structured market containment.  The entire rest of our global business rose 4% organically, led by mid- to high single-digit growth in the Americas and the markets of EMEA and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, excluding Mainland China. The excellent performance in these regions enabled us to deliver our sales outlook despite a slower-than-expected recovery of overall prestige beauty in Mainland China.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.11 was ahead of the outlook as we achieved a better-than-expected adjusted operating margin. There were several drivers for this more favorable profitability, led by a greater contribution to sales from skin care than forecasted as well as disciplined expense management. Notably, we continued brand-building investments in the areas with the greatest growth opportunities with AP spending rising as a percentage of sales.  While we had a better-than-expected start of the fiscal year, we are lowering our fiscal year 2024 outlook given the further incremental external headwinds in 2 specific areas of our business. First, the expected growth rate of overall prestige beauty has slowed in Asia travel retail and Mainland China, which is currently also evidenced in the presale phase of the 11.11 Shopping Festival.  To reflect this impact as well as the ongoing policies and efforts to contain a structured market activity, we are moderating our expectation for fiscal year 2024 retail sales for Asia travel retail and Mainland China. As part of this, we continue to expect to reset retail inventory in Asia travel retail by the end of the third quarter.  Second, we are reflecting the risks of business disruption in Israel and other parts of the Middle East. For fiscal year 2024, our revised outlook continues to expect sequentially improving sales trend each quarter with double-digit organic sales growth in the second half. We also still expect sequentially stronger adjusted operating margin each quarter with continued consumer-facing investment in our growth engines.  Moreover, we are accelerating and expanding our profit recovery plan, which is designed to benefit fiscal year 2025 and 2026 for us to realize our ambitions to rebuild profitability despite the external headwinds' increased pressure on the business in fiscal year 2024.  On our earning call in August, I described our 4 strategic imperatives for fiscal year 2024, which are, drive momentum where our business is thriving, return to growth in the U.S., capture demand from the returning individual travelers in Asia travel retail, and begin to rebuild our profitability. Let me share with you our progress across these pillars as well as the framework of our accelerated and expanded profit recovery plan.  First, we are focused on extending the gains we achieved in fiscal year 2023 in the numerous developed and emerging markets around the world where we prospered. In the first quarter, we did just that. In the markets of EMEA, we achieved impressive results once more driven by the U.K. and Germany. Organic sales growth were balanced across brick-and-mortar and online as engaging activation in store and on social media resonated strongly with consumers across our brand portfolio.  We extended our prestige beauty share gains in Western Europe driven by our high-quality hero products and innovation. In EMEA's emerging market, India was a standout driven by stellar gains by The Ordinary and double-digit growth by M\u00b7A\u00b7C. In Latin America, prestige beauty remains vibrant, and we again achieved strong results. Mexico and Brazil excelled, each up double digits organically. Our localized go-to-market initiatives in these 2 dynamic emerging markets have succeeded in attracting new consumers.  We continued our winning ways in many markets across Asia Pacific. The evolution of Hong Kong's SAR is especially compelling. And we realized very strong prestige beauty share gains with our brands' strong desirability, high-touch services and innovation engaging consumer as retail traffic increasingly returns.  Our performance in Japan and Australia once again robust driven by our diversified brand portfolio catering to local desires. Around the world, our direct-to-consumer business performed especially well. Every region contributed, led by double-digit organic sales growth in freestanding stores in Asia Pacific. On a global basis, we are thrilled that the makeup renaissance is infusing, and we have been ready to meet consumers as they again embrace their enthusiasm for the category. Makeup thrived in the quarter as the Americas, the markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific each contributed high single-digit organic sales growth to offset the pressure in the category from global travel retail.  We are successfully tapping into and creating trends with on-point innovation like M\u00b7A\u00b7C Studio Radiance Foundation and Est\u00e9e Lauder Futurist SkinTint Serum Foundation. During this exciting area for the category, our brands are leveraging their expert artists and social media know-how to engage with consumers and generate strong and expanding levels of earned media value.  Fragrance again prospered. We delivered our 11th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth led by outstanding performance in the Americas and Asia Pacific, strong share gains in prestige fragrance in Western Europe. We continue to believe that we are still in the beginning of a promising long-term phase of growth for fragrance in Asia Pacific as consumer increasingly embrace the category and penetration levels are low relatively to the West.  Indeed, in Asia Pacific, fragrance represent 8% of the prestige beauty industry, whereas in Western Europe, it is 40% of the industry. We are well positioned for this growth opportunity with our luxury and artisanal brands' alignment with the trends in the region as consumer gravitate to fragrance collections in addition to single use trends for multiple distinct scents of the highest quality.  Moving to our second pillar. We are focused on returning to growth in the U.S. for the full year and made strides in the first quarter when encouragingly, our organic sales growth improved strongly on a sequential basis and moved from a modest decline last quarter to mid-single-digit growth this quarter. Our multifaceted strategic plan included launching a robust innovation pipeline with increased focus on breakthrough ideas and leading trends, increasing engagement by brands on social media to realize greater earned media value, accentuating our strength in luxury and artisanal fragrance and in high-performance, ingredient-led and derma skin care and expanding brand reach in specialty-multi to attract new consumers.  During the first quarter, innovation proved to be a powerful catalyst for growth in the U.S. across every category. The contribution are many from Clinique, High Impact High-Fi Full Volume Mascara and M\u00b7A\u00b7C Studio Radiance Serum Powered Foundation in makeup to Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Rescue Solution in skin care and more. Through these high-profile launches with sophisticated media strategies, our brands elevated their engagement on TikTok, Instagram and other platforms.  Impressively, M\u00b7A\u00b7C's earned media value in the U.S. Beauty improved several ranks to #2 in the month of September, further solidifying its #1 rank globally.  We also achieved strong progress in fragrance in the U.S. driven by our luxury and artisanal brands. Le Labo, Tom Ford and Jo Malone London each rose double digit driven by multiple growth engines from innovation to online, brick-and-mortar and expanded consumer reach.  Encouragingly, we returned to growth in skin care in the U.S. The Ordinary was a standout. Consumers continue to gravitate to the brands for its scientific, ingredient-led skin care, driving strong prestige beauty share gains. The brand launch of Soothing & Barrier Support Serum drove exceptional new consumers acquisition trends on brand.com and strategically expanded The Ordinary portfolio to include more multi-active products. Moreover, Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer further bolstered our improving performance in the category.  Let me now discuss the third pillar, to capture demand from the return individual travel in Asia travel retail. For the first quarter, retail sales in global travel retail were substantially ahead of our organic sales decline, which reflects the execution of our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers. Indeed, we are making solid progress through exciting activation of our heroes, capitalizing on innovation and investing in beauty advisers. Across these 3 pillars, one of our greatest strengths to leverage is our diverse brand portfolio, which was a fundamental driver of our progress during the first quarter. M\u00b7A\u00b7C's excellent performance showcased the strength of our portfolio among large brands, while The Ordinary drove double-digit organic sales growth among our scaling brands and Le Labo excelled, rising over 40% among the developing brands.  Let me now turn to our fourth pillar, rebuilding our profitability. We are accelerating and expanding upon our profit recovery plan. We expect to realize $800 million to $1 billion of incremental operating profit across fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The plan consists of 4 building blocks to improve each of gross margin and operating margin.  First, we are focused on optimizing mix by elevating luxury across brands, most especially in skin care and fragrance, driven by consumer preferences by expanding our direct-to-consumer ecosystem across brick-and-mortar and online.  Second, we have identified many opportunities to maximize value through better price realization and accretive innovation. Third, we intend to increasingly leverage the strategic investment we have made over the last few years, most notably our new manufacturing facility in Japan, our new China innovation labs in Shanghai and expanded online capabilities.  Lastly, we believe we can unlock meaningful cost efficiency from a combination of shorter supply chains, regionalization of our value chain and improved forecasting accuracy enabled by our new integrated business planning progress -- process across the global operation supported by advanced AI capabilities. Before I close, I'm pleased to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2023 social impact and sustainability report. The future advancement made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. Importantly, we again achieved Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality and maintained our status of 100% renewal electricity globally for our direct operations.  The report also details that we obtained our global gender pay equity target for selected employees populations and achieved our spending targets with women- and black-owned suppliers and made strong progress toward our water withdrawal reduction and packaging targets. Today, we will also publish our second climate transition plan, which describes the effort in our ongoing climate transition journey. In closing, in fiscal year 2024, we will remain focused on driving momentum in our markets of strength, returning to growth in the U.S., normalizing our Asia travel retail trade inventory, and expanding prestige beauty share further in Mainland China from our calendar 2-year date gains while accelerating our profit recovery plan for a robust acceleration of profitability in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.  To our employees, these are difficult times for the world and all of us. I'm grateful for what you do each and every day in caring for each other and for our beautiful company.  Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Let me begin with a brief review of our first quarter results in order to devote the majority of my discussion to our revised fiscal 2024 outlook and our profit recovery plan. Our first quarter organic net sales declined 11%, and earnings per share was $0.11. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas increased 6%, led by mid-single-digit growth in North America and continued strength in specialty multi. In Latin America, net sales rose high single digits and was driven by continued strength in makeup as well as strong growth in both brick-and-mortar and online channels. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region fell 3%, primarily due to incremental headwinds from the slower-than-expected recovery of overall prestige beauty in Mainland China. There were several bright spots in the rest of the region, led by triple-digit growth in Hong Kong SAR as well as double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. Our strategic investments in brand activation and new product innovation continue to resonate well with consumers in these markets. Hong Kong SAR also benefited from increased traffic in brick-and-mortar due to fewer COVID-related restrictions compared to last year and the resumption of tourism. Organic net sales fell 27% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa due to the ongoing headwinds in our Asia travel retail business. The overall challenges in our travel retail business more than offset the performance in the rest of the region, where we saw strong growth in skin care and makeup as well as growth in most Western and emerging markets. Organic net sales growth was driven by our developed markets, led by the U.K., Germany and France. From a category perspective, fragrance continued to lead growth with organic net sales rising 5%. Strength from hero products as well as compelling innovation from Le Labo propelled double-digit increases in the Americas and in Asia Pacific. Tom Ford also contributed to growth, rising double digits in the Americas. Organic net sales rose 1% in makeup. We continue to enhance consumer engagement through strategic investments and brand campaigns, including social media activation and new product innovation. Once again, M\u00b7A\u00b7C was the overall top performer, and Too Faced, Tom Ford and Clinique all contributed to growth as well. Organic net sales declined 7% in hair care and 21% in skin care. The pressures in Asia travel retail and in Mainland China drove the decrease in skin care. The declines from Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer were somewhat offset by strong growth from The Ordinary. Consumer demand for the brand's hero products and new product innovation boosted its standout performance in the quarter. Our gross margin declined 440 basis points compared to last year. The benefits from the strategic pricing actions we took at the beginning of the fiscal year were more than offset by the under-absorption of overhead in our plants due primarily to the lower production of skin care products that accelerated in the second half of fiscal '23, higher obsolescence charges and an increase in promotional items, such as sets and samples, to support consumer activation. Operating expenses increased 950 basis points as a percent of sales driven largely by the reduction in sales. We maintain key investment plans in areas such as advertising and promotional activities, innovation and selling to accelerate growth where we had momentum, which collectively accounted for 480 basis points of the increase compared to last year. Operating income declined 84% to $108 million, and our operating margin contracted to 3.1% from 17% last year. Diluted EPS of $0.11 decreased 92% compared to the prior year. The impact from the cybersecurity incident we disclosed this past July was $0.08 dilutive to EPS. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS, including interest expense related to our debt financing and reflecting savings from royalties we no longer pay as we now own the brand. During the quarter, we utilized $408 million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $650 million last year. The decrease from last year reflects lower levels of working capital, including lower inventory levels, partially offset by lower net income. We invested $295 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $236 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, while we delivered on our Q1 expectations, we are lowering our fiscal '24 outlook for the balance of the year to reflect the slower-than-expected pace of recovery due to incremental external headwinds that continue to evolve during the second quarter. This includes the slower-than-expected growth in overall prestige beauty as well as the containment of the unstructured market activity in Asia travel retail and in Mainland China. This reduction also reflects the risks of potential business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East as well as currency headwinds. Using September 30 spot rates of for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS for the second quarter and for the full year.  We expect organic sales for our second quarter to decline 8% to 10%. The incremental pressures from impacting sales in our Asia travel retail business and Mainland China are expected to continue to more than offset anticipated growth in other markets globally. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each anticipated to dilute reported sales growth for the second quarter by 1 percentage point.  We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.48 to $0.58 for a decline between 62% to 69%. This includes dilution of approximately $0.08 from assumed risks of potential business disruption in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and approximately $0.04 from currency translation. The increases in our full year effective tax rate and net interest expense are collectively expected to dilute EPS by $0.04. In constant currency, adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 60% and 66%. For the full year, we expect organic sales to range between a decline of 1% and an increase of 2%. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each anticipated to dilute reported sales growth for the fiscal year by 1 percentage point.  We expect full year operating margin to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year due to the lower sales growth level. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 28%, reflecting the full year estimate of our geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.17 and $2.42 before restructuring and other charges and adjustments. This includes approximately $0.22 from the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East as well as approximately $0.16 from currency translation. The increases in our full year effective tax rate and interest expense are collectively expected to dilute EPS by $0.16. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 25% to 33%. Given this more challenging backdrop for fiscal '24, we have advanced the development of our multiyear profit recovery plan to support our priority to progressively rebuild margin in fiscal years '25 and '26. This plan is designed to accelerate the pace at which we expect to rebuild our margins while also facilitating operational efficiencies to support go-to-market agility in our local markets. The plan initiatives will target specific areas to deliver expanded gross margin and operating profitability improvements and is initially expected to drive $800 million to $1 billion of incremental operating profit over the next 2 fiscal years. We aim to accelerate many initiatives and substantially operationalize the plan in the second half of fiscal '24 to enable the realization of a meaningful amount of the benefits beginning in fiscal '25. Our first priority is to accelerate the rebuild of our gross margin. We plan to optimize our category, product and channel mix to support profitable growth as well as focus on accretive innovation. We aim to better capitalize on our strategic pricing initiatives by reducing discounts related to excess production and continuing to exercise our pricing power ahead of inflation in our markets. Furthermore, we plan to reduce excess and obsolete inventory by enhancing our operational efficiencies and begin to leverage the investments we've made to regionalize our supply network in Asia. Our profit recovery plan will also target OpEx reductions while further investing in consumer-facing activities that are imperative to accelerating recovery and driving long-term profitable growth. Our main areas of focus include containing head count as well as reduction in costs related to indirect procurement, T&E and transportation. These are just a few examples of actions we expect to take under our profit recovery plan. We plan to share more during our second quarter earnings call in February. In closing, while we are encouraged by the strength we are seeing across our brand portfolio and recovery markets, intensifying macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility as well as weakening consumer confidence in certain markets have unfortunately slowed the pace of our anticipated recovery in isolated markets. Given these incremental challenges, we are taking actions through the advancement of our profit recovery plan to support our intention to progressively rebuild our profit margins over the next few years. We remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our corporate strategy to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. The desirability of our brands as well as the positive momentum we are seeing across categories and in certain markets give us optimism for the future recovery in all of our markets and demonstrate the resilience of our multiple engines of growth and our ability to drive share gains globally. Our return to sales growth, combined with the profit recovery plan, which we plan to finalize and begin implementing in the second half of this year, as I said before, support the achievement of margin rebuilding and profit recovery in the next few years. I would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to our employees around the globe for their continuing commitment and efforts to deliver our results during these challenging times. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So apologies for a multipart question, but just had a few things on the profit recovery program. Conceptually, it sounds like it's more of a recovery from a depressed fiscal '24 base pushing even harder on some of the building blocks you outlined previously. Is that the case? Or are there more significant organizational changes that are now new in this plan to generate incremental savings? And also that $800 million to $1 billion profit recovery, should we think of that as just savings and recovery from a depressed base, and then base business top line growth on top of that could lead to greater recovery? How do we think about that? And then just, b, taking a step back, why not get even more aggressive here in terms of posture with a larger restructuring? Obviously, the external environment has changed. There's been some internal issues with supply chain and forecasting. So just thoughts on taking a more aggressive tack with the broader restructuring at some point? Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at this point, we may be having some technical difficulties with the speaker line. So one moment while we attempt to reconnect the speaker line. [Technical Difficulty]. And ladies and gentlemen, we do have the speaker line reconnected to the conference. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Rainey for a quick statement. Laraine Mancini : Thank you, everyone, for your patience. We apologize for the difficulty. Fabrizio and Tracey are ready for our Q&A session now. So Jamie, if you can take us to our first question, please? Operator : And our first question, once again, is Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So just wanted to start with a clarity question on the profit recovery program. It sounds like it's stemming more from a recovery versus a depressed fiscal '24 base and pushing even harder on some of the building blocks you had previously outlined. Is that the case? Or is it more of the larger organizational changes here that are new in this plan versus 3 months ago? And also, is that $800 million to $1 billion profit recovery, is that just the savings and recovery from a depressed base? Or -- and should we expect base business growth on top of that in terms of a top line rebound and the flow-through to profit? And then b, and apologize for the multipart but I want to get clarity there, just taking a step back, why not get more aggressive here with the larger restructuring? Obviously, the external environment has changed. There's been internal issues the last few quarters with supply chain and forecasting. In theory, SG&A levels have looked high ex marketing relative to peers. So just any thoughts on taking a more aggressive tack with a broader restructuring and how you guys think about that? Tracey Travis : Thanks, Dara, for the question. And again, we do apologize for the technical difficulties. As it relates to the profit recovery plan, it is incremental to the growth that we expect from the base depressed level this year, as you indicate, Dara. So -- and we are looking at everything. Obviously, the first thing we're looking at is, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, recovering our gross profit margin. And to your point, we've had issues with high levels of inventory. We've talked for years about and you all know that we typically, because of our lead times and our historic footprint carry high levels of inventory, which does affect our agility to be able to manage when shocks happen to the system, which is what's happened over the last couple of years. So certainly regionalizing our supply chain and completing the manufacturing facility we have in Japan will help us over the next few years in terms of being able to take more inventory out of transit and being able to produce a bit closer to demand. We also have implemented and Fabrizio talked about our integrated business planning process, which is leveraging some of the tools that we've invested in over the last few years to really improve the accuracy of our forecast, to include a bit more of the commercial drivers that drive our business in our forecast, again, to improve the accuracy and have less excess inventory. And then the actions that we're already taking this year to help improve our gross margins for next year is a significant pull-down in our production volume. So our production units this year are down about 25% from what they were last year. So even though we are anticipating now more modest growth given the update to our forecast, we are drawing down on the inventory that we have on hand as well as, obviously, some of the actions we're taking from a shipment standpoint to draw down the inventory that we have in trade in Asia travel retail. So there are a number of actions that we're taking that will help gross margin.  We are going through a SKU rationalization program in addition to cutting some of our smaller diluted innovation programs that were planned over the next year or 2. So there are lots of actions we're taking. All of those actions are not finalized yet, but many of them are in flight. They just won't impact as much this year as they will in future years. And then, yes, we are looking at our expense base and how we operate going forward, especially given our current level of sales and the lower base that we will be growing off of. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Powers from Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : I guess probably, Tracey, for you as well. Just maybe you could help provide a little bit more help bridging to the implied second half revenue and profitability outlook as implied in your guidance. It's a pretty significant step up from where you will be as of the end of December based on the 2Q guide. And that's despite battling what sounds like it will be headwinds in Asia travel retail inventory that will extend into at least the third quarter. So again, maybe you can -- just the building blocks there, your level of confidence and visibility. And alongside that, it might help just if you have a view on what consumption is for your brands through this first quarter, maybe through the first half versus what you're actually shipping. Because I think a big a big part of that bridge is that you start to ship more to consumption as you get out from underneath the inventory headwinds. But again, it's a very big step up. So just some clarity and some more detail there would be great. Tracey Travis : Yes. So no, you're exactly right. The assumption is that we ship more towards -- we're able to ship more towards the retail trends. I mean, as we said in the prepared remarks, our retail trends are ahead of our net trends in Asia travel retail, both still down because we are destocking the trade. And so the expectation is that, that will be completed by the end of the third quarter, so in the second half of the year. So part of this -- a large part of the step-up that you see in the second half of the year is our shipping more towards the retail trends that we are expecting in the second half of the year. That's a big part of it. And when you think about what happened to us and what we're anniversarying from the second half of last year, where we had the policy changes first in Korea that impacted our third and fourth quarter and then the policy change -- or policy reinforcement in Hainan, which impacted our fourth quarter. We had, in some parts of our Travel Retail business, very low shipments given those policy changes. And so we are anniversarying as well some of the initial shocks of that. Lastly, I would say that we are seeing travel come back slowly, so again, more slowly than what we anticipated. We are seeing lighter levels of conversion relative to what we saw certainly prepandemic or even pre- the significant changes in policy across the Asia region. And -- but we are seeing traffic pick up, and we are certainly expecting that, that conversion will gradually pick up as well in the second half. So those are some of the things that are underlying our second half expectations and the reason you see that big step-up in terms of volume. It's a combination of multiple factors, mostly in our Asia travel retail. A bit of it is a pickup as well in China also. Fabrizio, I don't know if there's anything you want to add. Fabrizio Freda : No. I just want to add that the -- our retail -- underlying retail calendar year-to-date is the mid-high single digits already globally. And our estimate of retail continue to be actually improving on this point. So the retail base, which is driven by the consumption of consumers, by the innovation, by the strength of the brand, by the demand from the consumer standpoint is very solid. Tracey Travis : For calendar year. Fabrizio Freda : For calendar year-to-date. And as Tracey has said, the readjustment of inventories is the big things that we are dealing with. And the evolutions of the policies that have created these readjustments is what has been difficult to predict and anticipate, and it's been pretty volatile. And so that's the adjustment. But the underlying fundamentals are already strong. It's not that we need to develop them in order to deliver the retail in the future. We just to continue evolving on these fundamentals. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Thanks for sharing that encouraging data point on retail sales. Tracey, you're talking about how shipments weighed down last year and it's kind of following the story for last year. We've been thinking, once you get leverage back in, and once you're able to turn back on the sales, catch up of retail sales is going to give you a lot of operational leverage to aid the gross margin recovery, and that's really a sales problem. But if I objectively stop back -- step back and look at the composition of the P&L, it does tell a slightly different story. I mean it doesn't look like a revenue problem. Revenue is actually just a round trip to where you were in the first quarter of '19. It looks like it's really a cost problem. Despite revenue being back where it was in first quarter '19, COGS up $250 million, SG&A up $320 million, and this is despite cost-cut program that you announced in late 2020, which so far doesn't appear to have yielded any savings. So can you help us understand what's caused the cost to run up so much over the last couple of years? Where have the efficiency savings gone so far? And I guess you are announcing the new actions to kind of go after it. Is that enough to kind of take that back out with the initiatives you have in place? Tracey Travis : Yes. No, great question, Jason. So if you look back to the composition of the P&L in fiscal '19, you'll see that our gross margins were higher. And certainly, our cost as a percent of sales was a bit lower. And obviously, given the pull-down that we've had in this latest guidance review, our cost as a percent of sales are higher as well. But we did have -- we've had 2 cost-saving programs. We had the Leading Beauty Forward program, and then we had the post-COVID Business Acceleration program. In both of those instances, certainly Leading Beauty Forward gave us runway. We were actually expanding operating margins by over 100 basis points a year, anywhere between 60, 80 to 100 basis points a year through that program. And that program allowed us to reinvest in capabilities that we needed, in particular to accelerate some of our digital marketing activities, to create some shared service structures in some of our functional areas and to be able to leverage cost better in those areas. So those programs -- that program was successful in both delivering margin expansion and expense leverage at the time. Advanced allowed us to close some of our underproductive brick-and-mortar doors and take a little bit of or adjustments as well. But we have, over the last few years, invested in a number of capabilities that have been needed in terms of in our regulatory area. That includes cyber, but also in the regulatory area given the increasing regulations in all of the countries that we do business with and the claims and -- that we need to support our brand marketing initiatives going forward. We've made investments in areas like our sustainability program. So we have made a number of investments that, other than the shocks that we've had over the last couple of years, have been investments that were needed in the company. Certainly, as we look forward, we are looking at, as I said before, the profit recovery program is both focused on gross margin because we're not back at the gross margin levels that we were at in fiscal '19 or even before. And we also are looking at expense areas, everything from our procurement program where we expect that we can get some savings there, to other org efficiencies. So more to come in January, February, actually when we give you our second quarter results on what the final plan will look like. But it's -- believe me, we are as focused on the P&L structure recovery as you are, Jason. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, just I would like -- Jason, just I would like to add the point on the fact that in really the profit recovery plan needs to rebuild gross margin. And as you said, also our new capability that we invested in that Tracey mentioned also in IT in many other areas needs to align to our current sales levels. And that's the work we are going to do as well. So those are the 2 big areas of focus. And in February, we will give much more specifics and details how will affect -- will impact 2025 in the majority in 2026. And so it's a pretty clear plan. I just want to say the entire organization is aligned on this plan. We have teams already working on this. We are completely committed to deliver that. And I just want to make a clarification on the programs that we announced in 2020 because you said it didn't deliver saving. It did deliver saving in the area of selling. That was the focus.  Remember, this program was tailored a lot to the fact that the COVID had disrupted the go-to-market part of the business and then increased our sales online versus the sales in brick-and-mortar. So we need to reallocate resources more to online and less to brick-and-mortar and to create the right future in -- the future balance of cost between the 2 areas, that's what we did. In fact, we invested in the online progress. Today, we are still leveraging the benefits. And we did reduce our cost in the brick-and-mortar selling areas accordingly to the trends that COVID had created. So when we did in the past these kind of programs, we have been pretty successful in delivering what we wanted. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Olivia Tong : A bit of a multipart question and follow-up to a few. But first, just a point of clarification on the global retail number that you gave of up mid- to high single digits. What's that for you or for the category? And then on travel retail, can you give us a sense on your visibility into how much inventory is still sitting with the groups or individuals versus in a brick-and-mortar duty-free channel, which we have a little bit better clarity in? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. Yes, it was -- it's our retail sales I was referring to. So calendar year-to-date in 2023, our trend of retail is mid-high single digit up to date. And our estimate for the future is to continue improving that trend. So my point is that retail is solid. And the negative net sales that we see in this first 6 months, for sure, our -- first, this month of the fiscal year are related to the readjustment of inventories that Tracey was mentioned. Second, on the visibility on these inventories in travel retail and -- by the way, when we say this retail, we say ex the travel retail numbers, just one clarification. So it's once the travel retail number. The point we are trying to make is that when the travel retail number, the retail and the net will be aligned, and we said they will be aligned as of the end of the third quarter. As of this moment, the retail -- the solidity of the retail progress is already in the making. That's the point we are trying to make. Anyway, on travel retail, we had a significant stock reduction in this first quarter. And we aim to be in line with the inventory expectation of retailers by the end of March. And we have visibility into these numbers. We have visibility. We have exactly the understanding for -- with each one of our retailers on where we are today, what are the programs that we are doing in order to accelerate sales retail of the existing stocks and what are the programs to obviously replenish and sell in innovation and all what we need to do in these areas. And finally, how by end March, we aim to have the retail and the net aligned. That's the program. Operator : Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Filippo Falorni : So I wanted to ask a question on Mainland China. It's the first quarter where you guys talked about a bit of a slowdown relative to prior quarters. So maybe, Fabrizio, can you give some context on the level of slowdown that you're seeing in the category? And then from a competitive standpoint, we've seen some local brands doing a little bit better, more on the mass side. But have you seen any trade-down within the category, both on skin care and cosmetics? Fabrizio Freda : Yes. No. First of all, the market was growing 2% in the first quarter in China. Our retail during this quarter was flat, but our retail in China calendar year-to-date is growing, and we are building market share. But in that specific quarter, the market growth went down to 2%. Now our estimate of the recovery of the beauty market in prestige was higher than that, and that is the -- one of the key readjustments we are making in the -- in projecting the year. That's the point. And so this 2% is the current trend level. Also, as I said in my prepared remarks, the presale period of Tmall and particularly on -- in general, the Singles Day, confirms a softer trend versus a year ago, and that's why we are reflecting this confirmation. Now we are more optimistic about the next part of the Singles Day events in November, but is -- the presale was confirming a softer market. In term of your second part of the question, is the -- there are local brands in mass and in masstige, which are doing well, we start doing well in China for sure. In prestige, the impact of that is for the moment limited. And so we see prestige being solid in comparison to mass in general. And we don't see a big movement from prestige to mass at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : I wanted to go back to Jason English's question regarding margins. And I guess, as we kind of look forward and try to think about the rebuild to the previous margin aspirations, how much of it will -- do you expect to come from the expanded cost savings? And how much is just resetting the business mix? Because travel retail is so profitable. And so do we need travel retail to get back to kind of a similar percentage of sales as where it was 3 years ago? Or would you be able to get there if travel retail ended up being smaller for reasons given how cyclical it is? Tracey Travis : Yes. No, it's a great question. Given where travel retail is right now, and certainly, we, I'm sure many others are thinking about the future of travel retail, which we are very encouraged by in terms of a return to growth but a return to the prior levels? Don't know. You have much now of the volume that has shifted to the local market. And I would expect to continue to see growth in the local market as well. So there may be a rebalance as it relates to the consumption for the Chinese consumer in particular as well as perhaps other consumer groups. So we're not counting on travel retail to get back to prior levels. If it does, that's great. But our profit recovery program, combined with some of the growth plans that we have for our markets and brands going forward, are not relying on that to return to profit margin -- the profit margins that we had previously. Fabrizio Freda : And I would like to offer a bit of historical perspective on what happened during this COVID period and the volatility that this brought. I mean when you -- because you were comparing in your question versus before COVID versus the 3 years ago previous -- so take 2019. Our business in Mainland China versus 2019 is more than doubled. Our TR business today globally versus 2019 is by now, with this estimate that we are giving to you now, is actually well below. So -- but it's true that during this COVID period, the TR business, also driven by the unstructured phenomenon that we have discussed previously was actually up. But then by now, this has been reabsorbed. So the profile of the business in -- with Chinese consumers in 2019 was that there was a base sales in Mainland China. There was a lot of the sales to Chinese consumer that were happening around the world in their travel. This was estimated to be up to 40% of what was the total consumption at that time before COVID. And this -- a lot of this was in travel retail and also was in the cities that were visited like, I don't know, London, Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, et cetera. So now during COVID, obviously, the frontier were all closed. So this consumption came back into Mainland China. In fact, our business in Mainland China today, as I said, has doubled the world was. And some of it went into travel retail, like Hainan development and all the other things that happened, which are very good for the long term. And some of it went into the unstructured business, which is actually going down now and is part of the readjustment. And these are positive things for the long term. And so the resulting -- the result of all these movements is frankly solid and sustainable for the long term because the results is a solid business in Mainland China, which we are supporting and will continue to support. We have built an R&D center. We have created all the abilities to be more locally relevant in the future and to continue to support this business and invest in this business and invest in this very important market for us in the long term that we believe is core to -- also to our future growth algorithm. At the same time, the amount of volatile business that went into the TR in the period of COVID has been derisked and is going down. And as we said, we need to continue to derisk it in this fiscal year. And that's what we are planning and that's what we are announcing in term of the resulting guidance of that. And the travel business, meaning the regular travelers and Chinese consumer that are traveling the world, this is gradually going up again and so will create good consumption by regular travelers. In this moment, it's going up more in Asia than in the West. The travel into the West is still relatively limited, but we forecast this over time to continue to improve. And the lending place of these movements will be the sustainable profitable business that we are coming back to. Bryan Spillane : Okay. So to be clear, we can get back to kind of the previous profit algorithm even if travel retail and basically Hainan is not as big as it was previously? Fabrizio Freda : Yes, we believe so. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we've reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Fabrizio for any closing remarks. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you. And I just wanted to try to summarize this enormous moving part and make sure that we give you the clarity of what we are focused on at this point in this moment. So we expect calendar year 2023 to be the final, and frankly painful, post-COVID reset period for the company. We move forward with confidence as our fundamentals are strong in this attractive prestige beauty industry. Our calendar year-to-date retail sales performance remain very solid in all recovery markets and in general, both developed and emerging in the mid-single high digit that I quoted before.  Our brand portfolio is better than ever with the recent acquisition of Tom Ford, solidifying our luxury strategy and The Ordinary, which we didn't talk a lot in this call but is becoming a powerhouse brand at the entry of growing active derma segment and is definitely our fastest-growing brand in our portfolio. Our innovation pipeline is robust for fiscal year 2024, but it gets even better and bigger and stronger in fiscal year 2025 with the expansion into the white space opportunity that we have identified.  We are on track to align retail and net sales via inventory reduction with our retailers in China private retail, as discussed during the call. We are focused on accelerating a more balanced growth in the future by market, by channel. And importantly, via the profit recovery plan, we are preparing to rebuild gross margin, leverage our new capabilities to align our expenses to our current sales level and further strengthen our consumer-facing activities. And we have the strategic focus and the talent to do this work, and together, intend to return to our historical cadence of delivering sustainable sales and profit growth. And thank you for your time and for your attention today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company\u2019s fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and webcast.  For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Rainey Mancini : Hello. On today\u2019s call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you\u2019ll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.  To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers\u2019 websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you Rainey and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. For the second quarter, we delivered our outlook for organic sales decline of 8% and exceeded expectations for adjusted diluted EPS. Organic sales in our global travel retail business decreased 28% with retail sales trends better than organic performance, reflecting both the execution of our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and efforts by various local authorities to contain structured market activity. We made meaningful progress with trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail and continue to expect to be a normalized trade inventory levels by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. The entire rest of our global business decreased 3% organically. This decline was primarily driven by the slow-down of overall prestige beauty in mainland China, although our retail sales trends were much better than our organic performance. Our global retail sales growth excluding travel retail in mainland China rose mid-single digits. The markets of EMEA delivered mid-single digit retail sales growth, and Asia-Pacific excluding mainland China rose double digits, as did Latin America, showcasing strong fundamentals for brand desirability and the success of our consumer engagement initiatives. Encouragingly, we made progress across several strategic priorities in the first half. Beyond reducing inventories of Asia travel retail, we improved working capital, realized higher levels of strategic pricing, and managed expenses with discipline. For the full year, we are revising our outlook as we have tightened the growth range for organic sales primarily to account for risk of macroeconomic volatility in some areas around the world and updated adjusted diluted EPS for an anticipated higher tax rate. In this revised outlook, we have maintained our prior outlook for full year operating profitability. Looking ahead, we are at an inflection point. First, we are positioned to return organic sales growth for the total company in the third quarter, and we expect organic sales growth to sequentially accelerate in the fourth quarter. Second, we are positioned for stronger profitability in the second half of this fiscal year compared to the first half. Third, we are preparing to meaningfully accelerate the rebuild of our profitability in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Indeed, since we spoke with you in late November, our teams have been actively engaged to operationalize the profit recovery plan. In doing so, we have identified further opportunities to enhance profitability while also generating more resources to be invested in consumer-focused areas to drive long term growth. As a result, we are expanding the profit recovery plan to include a restructuring program. While this is a difficult decision, we believe this now larger plan will better position the company to restore stronger and more sustainable profitability while also supporting sales growth acceleration and increasing agility and speed to market. For the consumer, we anticipate faster product and commercial innovation supported by strategic brand-building distribution and go-to-market advancement, where digital leadership is at the core. Moreover, we intend to increase our speed and agility as an organization, enabling quicker and more localized decision making to better create and respond to consumer trends.  The profit recovery plan is now expected to deliver incremental operating profit of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, up from $800 million to $1 billion previously. In terms of timing, this incremental profit is anticipated to be realized in fiscal year 2025 and \u201926, with more than half in fiscal year 2025. We are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will be enhanced by the profit recovery plan, enabling our company to more fully capture promising long term growth opportunities and remain a leader in global prestige beauty, and to reinforce our commitment to execute this larger plan with excellence, we have engaged global consulting firm, Alvarez & Marsal. They will provide strategic advisory services, partnering with us on our restructuring program as part of the profit recovery plan to drive the realization of a sustainable rebuild of profitability. For the second half of the fiscal year, we have strategic initiatives and exciting innovation to drive in North America, re-accelerate growth in mainland China, and drive momentum in markets that are thriving across developed and emerging markets in EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.  Let me begin with the Clinique brand. The brand will be doubling down on its authentic dermatologist brand heritage of over 55 years, deepening its relationship with the scientific community, strengthening its derma messaging and engaging new consumers. First, Clinique will be dialing up its derma education and consumer communications, including on social media, brand.com and in-store with new dermatologist partnerships and ingredient communication. Clinique has also announced the establishment of the new Mt. Sinai Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Center. The Center\u2019s research is expected to produce breakthrough advancement in the study of allergic skin and premature aging. Next month, Clinique will return to the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting to showcase its derm level science formulations, as well as its unique eye safety promise. All of this is coupled with Clinique\u2019s continued innovation of allergy tested and 100% [indiscernible] products evidenced by Clinique\u2019s new post-procedure relevant claim on powerful products, including Smart Clinical Repair lifting face and neck cr\u00e8me. Turning to the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, for over 50 years it has been a pioneer in longevity age reversal research, a frontier of skin biology for its Re-Nutriv luxury franchise. Last August, I spoke with you about how Re-Nutriv should be standing upon its successful Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliant Serum with compelling innovation. The franchise breakthrough, Soft Clean with cutting edge patented SIRTIVITY-LP technology for visible age reversal is now launching globally.  In [indiscernible], there is a companion serum cr\u00e8me foundation amplifying the franchise skin longevity science across categories. We are encouraged by the global appeal of this innovation from China to Japan to the U.S. While early, the franchise is welcoming new consumers at compelling rates, and we look forward to all that is to come for Re-Nutriv as launch events continue around the world. Moreover, the brand is collaborating with the Stanford Center of Longevity as the inaugural sponsor of a new program of esthetics and culture.  Beyond Re-Nutriv\u2019s striking innovation, we have more standout launches across brands in the third quarter, led by MAC and Tom Ford. The new MACximal Silky Matte lipstick modernizes the MAC icon with a new silky matte finish, lip conditioning benefits, and elevated packaging. For Tom Ford, Oud Minerale is primed to carry forward the brand\u2019s winning streak of innovation from Caf\u00e9 Rose in the first half. In the second half, we expect these initiatives and new product launches to build upon the strong momentum of several brands. Indeed, The Ordinary, La Mer and Le Labo, among others achieved terrific performance in the second quarter.  The Ordinary delivered an excellent first half as the brand again realized double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter. Its new soothing and barrier support serum, which launched during the first quarter, is the brand\u2019s most successful launch ever and is already among the top 10 ranked products in the U.S. prestige serum category. The Ordinary continue to excel in specialty multi globally and is also realizing very promising uptake on the new Tiktok shop in the United States through engaging live streaming and creator content.  La Mer further contributed to our strong underlying fundamentals in skin care. The brand\u2019s luxurious high quality product from the iconic cr\u00e8me, De La Mer to the new lifting firming serum, along with its exceptional services proved highly sought after by discerning consumers around the world. In mainland China, La Mer grew double digits at retail to realize strong share gains in prestige skin care. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances also performed quite well. Le Labo led the broad-based trends as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, Kilian Paris, and Editions de Parfum Frederic Malle each rose organically, fueling double-digit organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and gains in the Americas. For the second half, we expect to return to organic sales growth in mainland China driven by a rich innovation pipeline for a greater contribution to sales from new products in the second half than the first half, and we are investing in exciting go-to-market initiatives across brick and mortar and online.  Impressively, we entered the third quarter in mainland China with momentum in brick and mortar, having expanded our prestige beauty share offline in the second quarter, driven by strong double-digit retail sales growth in each of department stores, specialty multi, and freestanding stores. For online, while the channel was especially pressured by softness in overall prestige beauty and the 11/11 global shopping festival, our brands performed strongly [indiscernible] rising triple digits organically to partially offset lower sales for the event. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand ranked number one in prestige beauty [indiscernible], and it also ranked number one for store live streaming. For the fiscal year, we remain focused on North America returning to organic sales growth and are encouraged by the low single digit growth delivered in the first half. While makeup was pressured in the second quarter by the cadence of major new product launches, we are very excited by the innovation coming to market across the second half, beginning with MAC\u2019s MACximal Silky Matte lipstick we launched last week. Moreover, skin care grew for the second consecutive quarter in North America, driven by The Ordinary and Est\u00e9e Lauder. Our luxury [indiscernible] fragrances rose double digits in the quarter as our strategic initiative from expanded consumer reach with Kilian Paris to strong engagement on Tiktok by [indiscernible] are proving successful. In closing, we are at an inflection point, poised to return to organic sales growth in the second half and deliver sequentially stronger profitability than the first half, as well as expansion from the year ago. We are well positioned to deliver stronger profitability in fiscal year 2025 and \u201926, given the initial progress we have made from our profit recovery plan as well as its new restructuring program, and we are well positioned to invest in consumer-facing areas to capture exciting growth opportunities in global prestige beauty. I wish to extend my gratitude to our leaders and their amazing teams for the hard work and dedication which has taken us to this inflection point on a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you Fabrizio, and hello everyone. I\u2019ll start by reviewing our second quarter financial results, followed by a third quarter and full year outlook. I\u2019ll also provide details on our expanded profit recovery plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, our second quarter organic net sales decline of 8% met our expectations. Additionally, through tighter expense management and despite experiencing a higher tax rate due to the shift in our geographical mix of business, our earnings per share of $0.88 exceeded our initial outlook for the quarter.  From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region declined 14%, mainly attributable to the persistent challenges in our Asia travel retail business. The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East accounted for a 2% reduction in the region\u2019s overall net sales growth. The markets in the region had mixed results, leading to overall flat growth across all markets. Organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region fell 7%, reflecting continued challenges in mainland China. While our results on Douyin nearly doubled, our total online sales declined due to softer than expected performance on TMall during the 11.11 event. The overall online performance more than offset the increase in brick and mortar sales, which was led by double-digit growth in our freestanding stores. In the rest of the region, we saw strong organic net sales growth led by double-digit growth in Hong Kong SAR and Korea, as well as high single-digit growth in Japan. Our luxury fragrance brands Le Labo, Jo Malone London, and Tom Ford drove double-digit fragrance growth in the region, which was fueled by both effective commercial activations as well as compelling holiday product offerings.  Organic net sales in the Americas declined 1%, driven by a prior year benefit from changes made to MAC\u2019s take-back loyalty program in North America last year. Excluding this benefit, net sales were relatively flat in North America, reflecting growth in specialty multi and our freestanding stores and offset by softer performance experienced in department stores and online. In Latin America, organic net sales rose double digits, reflecting continued growth in nearly every market and strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments.  From a category standpoint, organic net sales fell 10% in skincare and 8% in makeup. In skincare, the ongoing challenges in Asia travel retail and mainland China drove the majority of the decrease. Organic net sales from The Ordinary and La Mer grew across every geographic region. The Ordinary saw double-digit growth in specialty multi, including ongoing expansion, and continued its focus on education-first content to drive successful social media activations. Net sales from La Mer increased both online and in brick and mortar, benefiting from captivating social media and holiday product activations. In makeup, the persistent challenges in Asia travel retail were compounded by the prior year benefit from MAC that I previously mentioned. Organic net sales fell 6% in hair care and were flat in fragrance. Net sales from La Labo grew double digits, fueled by both targeted expanded consumer reach and same store sales. The brand\u2019s ethos and high touch services persistently attract both new and loyal consumers, as evidenced by the double-digit net sales growth in our freestanding stores as well as strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments. For Jo Malone London, results from the brand\u2019s holiday collection were strong and net sales increased in nearly all channels of distribution. This growth was offset by a decline from Est\u00e9e Lauder due to the timing of holiday shipments compared to last year. Our gross margin decreased 60 basis points compared to last year. The positive impacts from brand mix and net strategic pricing actions were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and foreign currency.  Operating expenses increased 260 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the reduction in sales. Selling, advertising and promotional activities and innovation collectively accounted for 160 basis points of the increase compared to last year as we supported retail growth while also continuing to destock certain accounts in Asia travel retail. Operating income declined 25% to $577 million, and our operating margin contracted to 13.5% from 16.6% in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% compared to 24.9% last year. The increase in rate was primarily due to a true-up in the quarter to reflect the now higher estimated tax rate on our foreign operations for fiscal 2024 as a result of the change in our geographical mix of earnings. This also reflects an unfavorable impact related to previously issued share-based compensation. Diluted EPS of $0.88 decreased 43% compared to last year, including a dilutive impact of $0.19 from the change in the effective tax rate. The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.02 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay licensee royalties.  During the quarter, we generated $937 million in net cash flow from operating activities compared to $751 million last year. The increase from last year reflects lower working capital partially offset by the decline in net earnings. The favorability from working capital was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce inventory, primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods, that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell. We invested $527 million in capital expenditures and we returned $474 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024, which excludes the impact from the remaining payment for the outstanding Decium equity anticipated to occur in May 2024 and includes Clinique\u2019s heightened focus in active derma, while we delivered on our Q2 expectations, we are lowering the high end of our fiscal \u201924 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world. Despite this change to our sales outlook, we are maintaining our full year operating profitability expectation. Furthermore, we are updating our EPS outlook primarily to reflect the increase in our estimated full year effective tax rate, largely due to the anticipated geographical mix of our earnings. This is expected to more than offset the EPS benefit from foreign currency translation. Using December 29 spot rates of 1.107 for the euro, 1.273 for the pound, 7.109 for the Chinese yuan and 12.90 for the Korean yuan, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales for the third quarter and diluted EPS for both the third quarter and the full year. We expect organic net sales for our third quarter to increase 3% to 5% as both our businesses in Asia travel retail and in mainland China are expected to return to growth. In Asia travel retail, this growth assumes the continued reduction in retailer inventory as well as the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year. Currency translation and the potential risks of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.46, for a decrease between 3% to 24%. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to dilute EPS by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between an increase of 3% to a decline of 18%. For the full year, we expect reported and organic net sales to range between a decline of 1% and an increase of 1%.  Our plants have been running at reduced capacity, reflecting the pull-down of production in line with our lower shipments and to support the reduction of inventory levels both in-house and in the trade. This has resulted in inefficiencies in some of our manufacturing locations and may trigger a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs as in-period costs instead of when products are sold. We have reflected this potential expense and the corresponding pressure to gross margin in our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year, primarily in the third quarter. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year, and planned to partially offset the incremental pressure to gross margin through disciplined expense management. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. The increase reflects a larger mix of our expected fiscal 2024 earnings in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the unfavorable impact of previously issued share-based compensation.  Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.08 and $2.23 before restructuring and other charges. The potential risks of further business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and currency translation are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.07 respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 34% to 38%. Given the progress we have made in strategic initiatives the first half of the year, we expect to return to organic net sales growth and stronger operating profitability in the second half.  In November, we announced a profit recovery plan to support the progressive rebuilding of our profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Today with the announcement of a two-year restructuring program, we have further expanded this plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are focused on strategically leveraging our strengths to accelerate our return to more sustainable profitable growth while elevating our consumer activations and increasing our operating agility. The restructuring program is designed to right-size and streamline select areas within our organization, which unfortunately necessitates us making the difficult decision of an expected net reduction in positions globally of 3% to 5%.  The restructuring program is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue for the duration of the profit recovery plan. We expect to take charges of between $500 million and $700 million and generate annual gross savings of $350 million to $500 million before taxes. A portion of these savings is expected to be reinvested in consumer-facing activities to drive long term sustainable profitable growth. We now expect to drive incremental operating profit through all initiatives under the profit recovery plan of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, inclusive of net benefits from the restructuring program announced today. The plan is expected to yield almost all of the anticipated benefits by the end of fiscal year 2026, with slightly more than half of these benefits realized and contributing to operating profitability in fiscal 2025. In closing, we express our sincere gratitude to our teams around the world as they work tirelessly to execute against our priorities and drive our business forward. We believe that with the work that is being done to position us to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, and with the successful execution of our expanded profit recovery plan, we will be better positioned to return our company to long term sustainable growth and profitability. That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning guys. First, just a couple clarification questions under the restructuring and profit recovery program. Could you just give a little more detail on the structural changes in the program beyond the job cuts, and in the past, you\u2019ve done a pretty good job of delivering upside to savings goals, so how do you think about other savings areas that could potentially emerge over time and are you pushing beyond what\u2019s potentially announced? Then if you\u2019ll be generous enough to entertain a question on China, I think clearly there are some structural changes that have emerged in China beauty - the consumer perception of the category itself, willingness to be ostentatious, etc., changes in daigou selling, promotional impacts, mass brand performance. There have been impacts to Est\u00e9e brand share, so maybe Fabrizio, just take a step back and broad thoughts on the opportunity in China from here, but also specifically how do you adjust to these changes, what are your focus points from here in this new China reality? That\u2019d be helpful, thanks. Tracey Travis : Dara, I\u2019ll start with your question on the profit recovery plan. What we shared in November was our primary focus of the plan is to rebuild our gross margin, which is where we\u2019ve lost, as you all know, quite a bit of margin. Some of the strategies that we spoke about at that time that we were putting in place is really to focus on more profitable channel mix, to get our inventories under control, which should improve our obsolescence as well as some of the discounting that has gone on over the last few years. We are being more granular in terms of some of the strategic pricing initiatives that we have, and we also talked at that time about from an expense standpoint, implementing an incremental indirect procurement program to reduce some of our expense areas, so those were some of the initiatives that we spoke about that made up the $800 million to a billion in terms of the profit recovery plan at that time, and then obviously we\u2019ve announced an additional element to the program with the restructuring. On China? Fabrizio Freda : Yes, so on the China question, first of all, we had some soft consumer sentiment in the recent period that drove this lower prestige sales growth. However, first of all, we remain very optimistic about the long term opportunity in China and continue to invest for growth. The second point is you asked about the brand health and what\u2019s changing. Our brands are really, really strong. The retail sales growth has been much better than the net growth, and have been extraordinary, double-digit growth on many of our brands, particularly in luxury, like La Mer, Tom Ford, Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown, Kilian, Frederic Malle and Aveda, also Le Labo continues to track. In terms of market share, importantly we gained market share over the fiscal year in quarter two, despite there was a small reduction from market share in quarter two, but we gained market share in skin care category 80 points, we gained in fragrances, we gained in healthcare, and there are several important of our--many of our brands, we had really top ranks in 11.11.  Another element to support the strength of our equity is the freestanding store double-digit growth both in total and in live doors in mainland China, and I should also mention the strength in Hong Kong, where we grew substantial market share, in part reflecting success with the Chinese consumers.  Where we go from here? As I said, we are going to continue to invest in China and we believe we have a great team there and determination to continue building market share, winning in the long term. The first step is building our distribution in winning online channels, that this will continue, particularly accelerating the win in the short term, and continue to build market share in new cities in brick and mortar, where I would like to underline is in quarter two, we grew substantial brick and mortar market share in China. We\u2019ll also continue to leverage our current trend where retail sales [indiscernible] and we will support very strong holiday plans, which as you know, there is a high concentration of sales in China during the various holiday plans in the course of a year.  We also believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity in the luxury area, around our luxury brands, which as I said are doing very well, and I\u2019m referring to Est\u00e9e Lauder Re-Nutriv launch that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. La Mer, Tom Ford, Le Labo, Bobbi Brown have extraordinary aggressive plans. Strong innovation plans in H2, by the way, will continue and will accelerate, leveraging the new laboratory in Shanghai, which is an important opportunity for us. It is important--you asked what is changing in the various other aspects, so in the relationship with travel retail and in the managing of the overall pricing and promotions across the China consumer framework, we have dramatically improved the model or the process between the China team and the PR team in making decisions about promotionality, pricing, channel prioritization, and this is working better and better for the future. Also about the development of local brands, for the moment they are mainly in mass. We completely acknowledge there will be a continuous development of local brands, and the strength of our innovation and the differentiation of our brands is going to be key, and so we\u2019ll continue to invest in this [indiscernible] and in the strengths. The investment in our local lab, that will develop a lot of local innovation, is part of the answer to how to compete in this evolving environment as well. Last, we are shortening the supply chain with a factory in Asia Pacific and the ability to plan more accordingly to demand, and to be more agile in responding to demand is the added big capability that will increase the flexibility, the agility of our China team in following demand.  Net, we have a strong business in China, we have strong market share, and we are determined to continue to invest for the long term in China. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thank you Operator. Good morning Fabrizio and Tracey. My question is just related to maybe how you\u2019re going to measure yourself as an organization over the next two years, so the \u201925 to \u201926 time frame, and I guess I ask that in the context of stock clearly today reflecting an inflection, right - a positive inflection, but at the same time, there\u2019s a lot of mix things, right? China, slower than it was, but again optimistic for the long term. You\u2019ve got a lot of work to do underneath the hood, right, to execute on the restructuring program and improve margins. I guess I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about how linear this improvement would be, and again, are you going to change the way you\u2019re going to maybe measure yourself in the near term, just given how much work you\u2019ve got to do and maybe how different it was versus business as normal over the last couple of years. Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, absolutely. Your question gives me the opportunity to give an overview of what we are trying to do. I hope you realize that the work we have done in the last several months culminates today in what we define as an inflection point. It\u2019s first of all acknowledging the need of some important changes to align to the future opportunity to address our key pressure points developed in this post-COVID environment, so I\u2019d like to summarize first of all what we are doing, and then I will measure ourselves. The way we look at it is that, first of all, we are addressing the need to change and we are addressing the key pressure points. The first is the meaningful progress we have done on retail stocks in Asia, that as we said as of April, they should be aligned, and this will determine the ability to align in the future retail and net in this very important channel for us and for the industry in general. That\u2019s a big pressure point that we are addressing. The second, the part that was driving margin was obviously the need of gross margin, addressing our gross margin, addressing our cost structure, and right-size our organization, and so the profit recovery plan enlarged and the execution of it, which is strongly advanced, and the additional restructuring are addressing decisively our ability to recover profitability at an accelerated pace.  At the same time, this profit recovery plan is designed to resource our future growth plans more aggressively and to develop the right agility and speed to market in the organization, and we are going to measure this and to measures ourselves on that. For agility, I mean agility to allocate resources in this more volatile world more promptly and faster, as the one, for example, supply chain I just mentioned in the previous question, and the speed to market of innovation to better compete with local brands. The other important part of profitability and margin was skin care, and obviously we need to recover our skin care growth to address the profitability, as we discussed several times. I just want to clarify that the skin care growth during quarter two was very strong in the Americas, in EMEA, in APAC ex-China. In China, we didn\u2019t grow skin care during quarter two, but we grew market share of skin care, as I said before, in a very strong way.  We are addressing the skin care opportunity and the innovation of skin care that we are announcing, the one on Est\u00e9e Lauder, De La Mer Fresh, De La Mer future innovation, the Clinique repositioning, [indiscernible] leveraging its heavy touch position, the The Ordinary activation and future of The Ordinary globally, all these are engines that should continue to grow also in the long term our skin care, now that [indiscernible] the retail stocks in [indiscernible] will build. That\u2019s the first big pressure point that we address.  The second was the China growth and the China focus in the long term. I believe I addressed this in my previous answer. The third one is accelerating our plan to stabilize market share in the U.S., and we are addressing this, first of all, attacking very clearly our opportunity in active derm with the Clinique heritage position and with The Ordinary\u2019s extraordinary success. We will continue to address our distribution mix improvement needs toward the consumer growth segment and the channel segment. We are accelerating our fragrance sales growth, which is very important in the region, and also would like to remind that we have the top two brands in skin care and in makeup in the region, and in skin care with the arrival and the growth of The Ordinary, now we have four of the top five skincare brands in the market and The Ordinary gained 200 points of share in the prestige market just in quarter two. We are addressing very decisively the future opportunities of this in North America. So a second point is we want to continue building on our strengths, and we said that we have strengths clearly in APAC ex-China at this moment with the comeback of Hong Kong, with a very important improvement versus the COVID period. In EMEA, we continue to have strong growth, for example in skincare and in markets in Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey. Our emerging markets grew mid-double digits, and we believe we have a strong opportunity in emerging markets, where we have very strong market share position in every one of the top ones for the future acceleration. Our direct-to-consumer business, our freestanding stores grew double digits, supporting also our brand strength in equity, so we will continue building on all these strengths and our plans focus on this. We remain confident in the future of the prestige beauty market, so there remains very attractive--we remain focused as a pure player on these very high growth [indiscernible] market in the consumer goods industry, and finally, as I said, the profit recovery plan and the restructuring will be a key enabler of all these strategies in our future. So yes, we see that we are at an inflection point and that we are going to measure ourselves on all these elements combined, meaning we are going to measure ourselves with the pace of recovery of our profitability, with going back to a growth--sustainable growth model and investing in our brands for the future, and re-addressing the needed changes in our organization to improve agility of resource allocation and speed to market. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. I wanted to talk a little about, just first, a follow-up on your U.S. distribution comments in terms of stabilizing U.S. share. With Clinique and The Ordinary sort of towards the entry level price point in prestige, how do you think about further diversification in U.S. distribution, especially as department store exposure continues to come down? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : As you know, we are working on this for some time, and the way we address it is that we are going to continue to increase the focus on high growth channels. We have done some extraordinary improvement in the specialty channel in the last year, and that will continue to be our focus. We are also obviously focusing our support to our department store partners where we have high market share, and we are managing this business carefully, and we are continuing to accelerate online with various opportunities that we have in this world, and the consumer is shopping more and more omnichannel, and so we are going to continue to put focus on the opportunity of omnichannel growth that we have in the United States. That\u2019s what we are doing, and you will see this strategy to be implemented step by step in the next 12 months, accordingly, to these opportunities. Operator : The next question comes from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Oliver Chen : Hi Fabrizio and Tracey. You mentioned agility many times. What are your thoughts on the priorities in terms of what you\u2019ll do there, as well as direct-to-consumer and digital? Community engagement, as you know, is very important in terms of user-generated content and making sure to embrace a lot of new formats. A follow-up - as we model inventory in the back half, your inventories are in much better shape, but what gives you the conviction that the inventory levels related to Asia travel retail will be healthy in terms of the back half? Just some key aspects and being more confident there. Thanks a lot. Tracey Travis : Thanks Oliver. I\u2019ll start with the inventory levels.  You know, we\u2019ve made significant progress, as we said in our prepared remarks, on inventory and bringing down the levels of inventory in the trade that were high in pockets of Asia travel retail. We are pretty comfortable that we will be able to bring those down to levels that are healthier, that are expected to drive regular replenishment levels and therefore be the net sales accelerator that we have embedded in our guidance for the second half of the year. In addition, what we spoke about is we\u2019ve also, at the same time of bringing down inventory levels in the trade, brought inventory levels down in-house, and that is part of the benefit that we saw in terms of the cash improvement in the quarter, and we expect with the tools that we\u2019ve invested in and having healthier levels of inventory overall, largely driven by the pull down in production that we did in the first quarter that we spoke about, that we are going to be in much better shape as we support some of the upcoming innovation that we have, as well as in the future in terms of bringing inventory levels into better control.  Obviously the investment that we\u2019ve done, as Fabrizio mentioned, in our Asia supply chain allows us to have shorter lead times in the region and be able to better manage any volatility that may occur in the future, now that we have a plant and an R&D center in the region, so all of those things help us in terms of creating better inventory agility, being able to produce faster to market demand than we have been in the past. Fabrizio Freda : Then your question in agility, there are two measures of agility that we look at as very important. One is agility in responding to volatility faster in reallocating resources, so the action in this area has been the shortening of our supply chain in Asia, for example, and the various aspects--even the way we are repositioned. We are leveraging the historical heritage position of Clinique and doubling down on it in active derma, the way we are leveraging The Ordinary strength in active derma, so in other words how we are responding to the consumer trend of active derma now very decisively, so those are elements of agility. We want to improve our ability to do these things faster and more promptly in the future. The other aspect of the agility is the way we go to market, so reaction to, for example, the new platforms. We are learning how to operate with Tiktok globally; much more, we are focusing on earned media value much more our organization, including resource allocation but also the training and the development and the understanding of the various models. We are doing this is all markets for the world at the same time. We are modernizing our promotional models and making them more relevant to the current consumer trends, and importantly as an umbrella concept, we are becoming more and more able to react to trends. There are two kinds of trends we are working our organizational development on. The first is the long term trends, the fundamental changes in consumer preferences, where frankly we have been always pretty strong, and we are further refining these abilities. Then there are the short term trends, the trends that can change in a week, in a month of what\u2019s going to be popular online in a certain country, in a certain moment, where we have developed better and better models to react to short term trends with our brands, with our execution, with our resource allocation. And by the way, the work on organization of the profit recovery plan is also pillared to improve our ability in both these areas, meaning the agility in resource allocation and the agility in reacting to trends and to the new models of marketing around the world. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Dana Telsey : Hi, good morning Fabrizio and Tracey. As you think about pricing and the new launches that you have coming, how do you think about pricing both for existing hero and new products and how it\u2019s changing? Then as you continue to enhance the specialty multi distribution, how do you see engaging with the department stores and what that relevance--how that relevance changes? Thank you. Tracey Travis : We have a pretty sophisticated, Dana, pricing model for new product launches, and I think we had spoken about it even under the profit recovery plan, making sure that our new product launches actually are accretive to our overall margin, so we have actually cut some of our new product launches that were planned for fiscal \u201925 in order to do that, and re-looked at our innovation pipeline to make sure that what we are launching is in fact accretive. But the sophistication that goes into our new product pricing model in terms of looking at what the competitive benchmarks are relative to that particular launch, also from a market standpoint, making sure again that the new product is positioned appropriately, we look at if it\u2019s replacing an existing franchise, measure the product and pricing differentials related to added content, added benefits, added packaging, etc., so there are a number of things that factor into it.  I think that as we mentioned, we\u2019ve got some very exciting new product launches in the second half of this year. MAC is re-launching two of their largest franchises, Studio FX and the MAC lipstick. We\u2019ve got Est\u00e9e Lauder Re-Nutriv with SIRTIVITY that is quite exciting, really playing on the longevity focus that is accelerating in the market. Fabrizio just talked about trends - we\u2019ve got quite a bit of trend-based but highly efficacious from a quality standpoint, products launching in the second half of the year, all of which have been priced appropriately for the benefits that they are contributing. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, and on the different retailers, the retail channels, we obviously support every one of the retail channels, so specialty multi, department store. Every retail channel is going to be supported more and more in a tailored way, meaning tailoring to their model, to their strategy, to their specific consumer profiles, and this will be very different country by country. There are countries where certain channels grow faster than others and maybe the opposite happens in other countries, so it\u2019s not about their preferences are changing, the strategy is about tailoring the strategy to each channel, supporting every one of our customers. At the end, the result of this is that the mix of our business in every country of the world will be focused on growth. It will be focused and leveraging the channels that the consumer is in that specific moment we choose, or the different target of consumer we choose in every channel, so it\u2019s about tailoring to all the opportunities wherever they are. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey, thank you and good morning. Back to the profit recovery plan, I think your outlook today at the midpoint implies roughly $1.5 billion or so of operating profit in fiscal \u201923, and you frame the recovery program as incremental profit from here, which assuming the benefits are all off a fiscal \u201924 base, that implies $2.5 billion to $3 billion or so of operating profit in fiscal \u201926, and I think that\u2019s before considering presumed underlying growth in the business over those next couple of years. Tracey Travis : That\u2019s correct. Steve Powers : Okay, great. I guess the question is how do you protect--against that objective you\u2019re saying today, how do you protect against those incremental profits being essentially countered by incremental investments that emerge over that time, because you\u2019re seeing the expectation for investors today that the profit comes, it\u2019s a pretty firm objective, but how do you guard against other costs creeping into the model over the next couple of years? Tracey Travis : It\u2019s a great question, Steve. Look - we are certainly realistic that with regulatory changes, with what happens with inflation, there are a lot of things that we, in the base business before the profit recovery plan, need to be able to manage, and one of the things that we are working through with our organization is how do you make those choices in terms of what to invest and dis-invest in, in terms of the base business, so those are areas that we are keenly focused on as we look at just what the base progression, which you\u2019re very familiar with what our normal progression is, outside of obviously this unusual period of post-pandemic disruption that we\u2019ve experienced, so. We certainly have in the past been able to do that and believe that we can do it in the future as well.  We\u2019ve also stood up a very disciplined and strong project management office in order to be able to track all of the savings that we are committing to, and also obviously with the base business, making sure that we\u2019re meeting our normal base expectations as it relates to regular growth and margin expansion. Fabrizio Freda : I\u2019d just like to add one point, is that as you said, the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion being defined as extra profitability, which means that the reinvestment part in building our brands and accelerating growth comes from more savings than what we define as extra profit, so to be fair, there will be more savings. Some of them will be reinvested in consumer-facing growth acceleration, and the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion is our target for extra profitability, and that\u2019s why we have been very clear on that. The investment in growth that will be done, or the extra investment in growth for the future that we want to develop capabilities for, are for consumer-facing. We are not planning to invest in many new capabilities; rather, we want to leverage the capabilities we have built in the last period in a very efficient way, so that\u2019s the way to think, I believe, about the profit recovery plan. Operator : Our last question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. Two things I wanted to touch on. The first was just, I think during the prepared remarks, you commented that retail sales ex-China and travel retail are up mid-singles, but organic also excluding those things was down 3, so. I know you\u2019ve spoken very explicitly about the inventory dynamics in Asia travel retail, but I was just curious about inventory dynamics outside of those markets and why that disconnect was that large. That was question one. Then question two is just on the go-forward plan around unstructured markets across Asia. Of course we all know there\u2019s been regulatory change in China and Hainan, but you\u2019ve spoken many times in the past, Fabrizio, about how that market tends to shift and move with the travelers and currency and all sorts of things that can impact where it\u2019s taking place, so was curious on your thoughts about that unstructured market going forward, what you are or aren\u2019t going to do in terms of regulating the degree of participation, because I think it has a lot to do with how we should be thinking about and modeling the absolute size of the travel retail business in dollar terms as we look out over the next several years. Thanks. Tracey Travis : Thanks Lauren, I\u2019ll start with the retail and organic. You know, when we have--especially in the second quarter, obviously when we have big events like 11.11, and you have holiday and in the case--you know, for us, when those events don\u2019t go as well as expected, obviously retailers pull back on and we pull back on some of the shipments that we have to those retailers, in order to bring things back in line, so you will see from a quarter to quarter standpoint, there may be some disconnects related to that, but it averages out over the course of a year, so we don\u2019t have any issues in any other markets like what we have been experiencing in Asia travel retail for you all to be concerned about. Fabrizio Freda : On the unstructured market, our focus is on travelers and travelers converting, and that is getting better and better around the world, just to be clear, apart from the China situation that we have discussed many times. In the rest of the world, there is extraordinary progress in this area, double digits, in some cases triple digits in every market of the world, so this will happen more and more, also in China, also in Korea, and also in the part which has been the slowest to recover in that direction. So first part of the answer is the focus to continue growing in travelers and continuously improving the travelers\u2019 conversion. As we are seeing from the data of the market, the travelers has been improving very, very nicely, but the conversion of the travelers for the moment is below expectations. The unstructured market as such is reducing, and I want to say it\u2019s reducing also for regulations for the intentions of the government, so the retailers, so there is a trend to reduce the amount, and obviously this is also what we are doing, and so the way you should expect is that the unstructured market will be reduced, in my opinion will reduce also as a market, but will be reducing for us. It will be reducing in a gradual way as the travelers improve and increase over time. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. If you were unable to join the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 :00 pm Eastern time today through February 12.

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin. Rainey Mancini : Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our results today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, reference to online sales, include sales that we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. [Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey and hello to everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to review our third quarter results and discuss our strategic initiatives. For the third quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 6% at the high end of our outlook, exceeded expectations for profitability and continued to significantly improve working capital. We achieved stronger-than-anticipated performance beginning with gross margin. Results benefited from a greater than expected mix of skin care. Moreover, we made great strides in reducing the pressure on excess and obsolescence, driven by our now lower inventory levels and in realizing strategic pricing. Further contributing to the outperformance, we manage expenses with discipline across multiple areas of the business and have shifted certain advertising spending to the fourth quarter to support our rich innovation pipeline and expanded consumer reach. Encouragingly, with our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook, we are confident that the second half of fiscal year 2024 will indeed prove to be an inflection point for the company, representing a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. First, momentum in organic sales growth is primed to accelerate in the fourth quarter for a strong second half. Second, we continue to expect operating margin in the second half of fiscal year 2024 to be higher than the first half and to expand from the year ago period. Third, with a profit recovery plan designed to deliver $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit in fiscal year 2025 and 2026, we are well positioned to rebuild our profitability. And with the profit recovery plan also expected to generate savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives. We are well-positioned to accelerate sustainable sales and profit growth as a faster and leaner organization with stronger leverage from our future growth. During the third quarter, we accomplished much to solidify the inflection point of the second half. Indeed, we made progress in achieving targeted trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail. We are encouraged by the evolution of our Asia travel retail business this fiscal year as we execute our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and effort by various local authorities to contain a structured market activity. And retail sales growth in Asia travel retail significantly improved sequentially, returning to growth in the third quarter. This improving retail sales trend near travel retail complemented double-digit retail sales growth we continue to see in EMEA and the Americas travel retail. So far this fiscal year, we also invested in the long-term growth opportunities of traveling consumers evidenced by our brands having moved within Hainan and Sanya International Duty-Free shopping complex to the Galleria's new Global Beauty Plaza. The larger elegant new stores expands upon the high-touch services and experiences that we offered at the previous locations in the complex from Est\u00e9e Lauder announces its new Skin Longevity Institute to La Mer cabin offering bespoke spa services and KILIAN Paris Juice and cocktail bar featuring fragrance inspire cocktails. We also made great progress in advancing strategic initiatives and launching exciting innovation to fuel North America, reaccelerate growth in Mainland China and drive momentum in markets that are strong across developed and emerging markets in Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. Let me begin with clinic where we had a robust quarter of progress as the brands double down on its authentic dermatologists brand heritage. Clinique deepened its relationship with the medical community returning to the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting with high impact engagements. The brand also established the Clinique dermatologist Creator Council, a collection of doctors who are amplifying the sharing of science and dermatological insights on their own social channels, as well as informing Clinique narrative on its social platforms. Impressively, Clinique influence earned media value for skin care in the US showed 80% during the quarter, leaping 33 spots in rank. We believe this is just the beginning of the success Clinique will realized by communicating its dermatological education and clinically proven solution for skin care to make up. Moreover having started with Clinique in March, we are thrilled to be strategically expanding our consumer reach in the US as a select few brands will open dedicated storefronts in Amazon's fast-growing premium beauty store over the coming months. Clinique's launched capitalized on its renewed dermatologists guided branding with striking creative assets and elevated storytelling. Impressively, Clinique store has exceeded our retail sales expectations so far and already contributed in March to the brand's share gains in US prestige skin care biggest subcategory of moisturizers among others as well as in US prestige makeup. We also successfully accelerated our innovation in the quarter. For the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, we brought to market breakthrough innovation across franchises. For its luxury renewed franchise, the brand was inspired by its over 15 years of skin longevity research, with its new Ultimate Diamond transformative brilliance of cream and serum cream foundation. The impact of these launches is powerful beyond contributing to the brand growth they firmly established [indiscernible] as a leader in the science of skin longevity, a visible age reversal. For Est\u00e9e Lauder Supreme franchise, the brand leveraged its decades of [indiscernible] repair expertise in collagen research with the new revitalizing Supreme night bounce cream first launched to rave reviews in Asia Pacific and expanding globally in the coming months. We believe this launch holds great promise, serving to strengthen the brand leadership in nighttime science and skin care across subcategories. La Mer extended its winning streak of innovation with the most rising fresh cream which along with its Icon Hero products drove the brand to be the strongest contribution to the company growth for the quarter. Beyond these strategic innovations and go-to-market activations across active derma, longevity, night skincare, M A C introduced newness in makeup to jump start our rich innovation pipeline in the category for the second half. M A C launched Macximal silky matte lipstick to greater claim successfully modernizing its Icon M\u00b7A\u00b7C lipstick with nourishing ingredients and bolder packaging. From Seoul to Berlin to New York City events Macximal pop up events drove strong engagement and earned media value. M\u00b7A\u00b7C remastered studio 6 fixed fluid foundation came to market in April delivering a new soft map finish enhanced with new skincare ingredients at even more shades. This high sought innovation and its icon prove the enduring love of M\u00b7A\u00b7C consumers and the capacities alike, as the brand celebrates its 40 years in 2024. Looking at fragrances. Over the last couple of months, we have expanded our consumer reach in the high-potential Asia Pacific region, opening spectacular flagship stores for Jo Malone London and [indiscernible], each unique with locally relevant features. And we are incredibly excited for the evolution in luxury and artisanal sciences as together with Valmond, we introduced Valmond Beauty this September. Across our brands and around the world, we are focused on leveraging technology, including AI in support of our enduring strengths and high-touch experiences and high-quality products. We continue to partner with leading technology companies from Microsoft with whom we are collaborating to embed AI to drive faster speed to market and local relevance to Google Cloud, as we strive to enhance customized targeting of media at scale. Turning to the regions. We have spoken about our focus on driving the momentum in markets which are strong. To that end, we have delivered terrific results across many markets, reflecting the desirability of our brands, a compelling innovation which I described and strong go-to-market execution. We see this across our developed and emerging markets around the world. Beginning in Asia Pacific, Hong Kong, SAR, Japan have prospered up double-digit organically in the quarter and year-to-date and we are excited about what's to come including the launch of the ordinary in Japan, during the fourth quarter. Moving to EMEA, Germany and Italy have consistently contributed to growth in the markets of the region each quarter. Mexico, Brazil and India, strong double-digit growth in the third quarter fueled excellent performance in our emerging markets year-to-date. For North America, we delivered sequentially improved organic sales trends in the third quarter, driven by the multi-facet strategic plan we first discussed with you in August. We are pleased with the results we are seeing in our areas of strategic focus. Skin Care grew organically in North America for the third consecutive quarter, driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and the ordinary, health hero products, innovation and go-to-market activation excelled. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances rose double-digits organically one more fueled by Jo Malone, London, KILIAN PARIS and TOM FORD. Across our brand portfolio in North America, we are realizing success, as we focus on deepening consumer engagement on social platforms, where so much discovery in beauty take place. The Ordinary has long been a pioneer with an outstanding social engine and more of our brands have enhanced their engagement with consumers this year. We are also successfully expanding our consumer reach to better serve new consumers from Clinique's new storefront in the US Amazon Premium Beauty store to expansions early this fiscal year as the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand entered into more Ultra Beauty stores and KILLIAN PARIS entered into additional Sephora stores. For Clinique as the number one dermatology beauty brand in the US Prestige, we are optimistic for the positive impact is launched on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store will have for the fourth quarter in the initial performance in March. For Mainland China, we returned to organic sales growth, albeit at a slower pace than expected amid an overall soft prestige beauty industry. Retail sales for prestige beauty were strong in January but moderated in February and March, due in part to the Chinese New Year considering the Valentine Day this year which limited gifts. This certainly impacted the industry but also many of our brands which have a strong presence in gifting. Our focus remains bringing irresistible newness to consumers to best create growth opportunities. Here our innovation in Est\u00e9e Lauder Nutriv and Supreme franchise as well as a La Mer and M\u00b7A\u00b7C were well received across the third quarter and we have more compelling launches in the fourth quarter. One in particular from Est\u00e9e Lauder Perfectionist Pro franchise is especially exciting as it is among the first product created in our China innovation labs and addresses local demand for SPF 50 plus UV protection that is suitable for sensitive and post derm procedures of the skin. With a four quarter innovation pipeline is standing upon the innovation pipeline is standing upon the innovation launch throughout the third quarter and the key shopping moments of 618 are coming we are increasing our investment in advertising a go-to-market activation to sustain retail. Since we spoke with you in February, we also made important progress in all work streams across the pillar of the profit recovery plan, of which I'm pleased to share a few examples with you today. For one our integrated business planning process which has now rolled out globally is contributing to operational inventory improvements. Our enterprise-wide integrated business planning will serve as the foundation to drive better demand planning and reduce excess enable obsolescence. It is complemented by advanced planning technologies including AI to statistically elevate forecast accuracy, a dynamically positioned and deploy inventories. We have refined and optimized our innovation pipeline for fiscal year 2025 and 2026 to best focus on accretive innovation, bringing to market products that both creates and drive trends locally and globally across categories. Innovation in fiscal year 2025 is still expected to be even bigger and stronger than in fiscal year 2024, with more breakthrough innovation and expansion into white space opportunities. We also announced plans to streamline manufacturing and distribution on a campus through realigning ship schedules consolidating operations into fewer buildings and shifting powder manufacturing to a trusted third-party partners. This strategic initiative accomplished multiple objectives. As in addition to consolidating capacity and optimizing costs, we also expect greater speed to market by leveraging more external innovation with a global leader in powder. Before I close, I want to speak to the exciting milestones in our brand portfolio during the fourth quarter. First, a few days ago marked a one-year anniversary of our Tom Ford acquisition, this transformational deal where we evolved from licensees of Tom Ford Beauty to the owner and licensor of Tom Ford solidified a coveted brand in the company luxury portfolio for the long-term and created a new royalty revenue stream. Moreover, it afforded us strategic synergies which we are now unlocking demonstrated by the recent launch of brand.com in the US and UK as just one example. And with the Ermenegildo Zegna Group and Marcolin, we are capitalizing on the power of the brand modern luxury glimmer across fashion, eyewear and beauty connecting these three verticals in compelling new ways to drive growth. Indeed in February, for Fashion Weeks from Milan to London, Paris and New York, we orchestrated the first-ever 360-degree cross-category campaign and secured a blockbuster fragrance launch. Later this months, we are thrilled to be further solidifying our brand portfolio in yet another way, as we acquired the remaining interest invasion, completing the deal we made three years ago when we became a majority owner. During these three years DECIEM Inc and its beloved brands The Ordinary, assured to new heights, ranking top five in prestige skin care in many markets including top two in its home markets of Canada and the US. Together, we have successfully invested to scale innovation for The Ordinary and have increased the ordinary innovation as a percentage of sales from 5% to over 25% expected this fiscal year, expanded the brand globally from India to the Middle East to South Africa and improved its profitability by driving operational efficiencies in the supply chain. With that said, we believe The Ordinary and DECIEM still have bigger opportunities in front of them and we are excited for what the future holds. Finally, we are pleased to see our initiatives and progress in sustainability recognized. And since we spoke with you in February, we were included in the CDP's Climate A list for 2023. Overall, we received our best-ever collective scores in 2023 from CDP as along with these excellent climate results we scored A- in each of the water security, forest timbers and forest palm oil. In closing, we are at an inflection point in our company performance, primed for a strong second half of organic sales growth and improved profitability. And with our profit recovery plan, we are well positioned to meaningful rebuild our profitability in fiscal year 2025 and '26, while also generating savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives. We are confident in our strategy to realize the promising growth opportunities of global prestige beauty, leveraging the strengths of our diversified brand portfolio, rich innovation pipeline and the superior quality of our products. I extend my gratitude to our employees for the significant contribution you have made in bringing us to this inflection point of a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. Our third quarter organic net sales increased 6% at the higher end of our expectations. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we've made thus far in Asia travel retail, with reducing retailer inventory and the corresponding return to net sales growth. These achievements in the quarter were a bit earlier than expected and led to a partial shift in the expected timing of the resumption of replenishment orders from the fourth quarter to the third. Partially offsetting this growth was lower-than-expected net sales in Mainland China, reflecting the impact of ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty, in part due to subdued consumer confidence and softness during holiday and key shopping moments. Our earnings per share of $0.97 exceeded our outlook for the quarter, due to the acceleration of skin care, the return to net sales growth in our Asia travel retail business, tighter expense management and a lower tax rate. The reduction in our tax rate was largely driven by the shift in our geographical mix of business. Regarding our regions, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region increased 12%, driven largely by the growth in our Travel Retail business. Our Travel Retail net sales increased strong double digits, returning to growth after seven consecutive quarters of decline given the sequential acceleration of retail sales and shipments, as well as the anniversary of lower shipments last year, which were pressured by transitory headwinds in Hainan in Korea, as well as limited international flights, visas and group tours from China to other markets last year. Elsewhere in EMEA, organic net sales in our priority emerging markets increased strong double digits where we drove growth from most brands and in most channels of distribution given our strategic initiative to expand consumer reach in particular for our fragrance and skincare brands. Our results in mature markets were mixed resulting in overall flat growth. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region increased 3% led by Hong Kong SAR, Mainland China and Japan reflecting mid-single-digit net sales growth in skin care and high single-digit growth in fragrance. Organic net sales in the Americas increased 1% largely due to Latin America where continued growth in Mexico and Brazil led by makeup drove double-digit increases in department stores and freestanding stores. Organic net sales in North America were flat in the quarter as growth in fragrance and skin care was offset by declines in makeup and hair care. The double-digit growth in specialty-multi driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and M\u00b7A\u00b7C was offset by softer performance in department stores and direct-to-consumer channels. From a category standpoint, organic net sales in skin care rose 9% largely driven by our Asia travel retail business as well as from Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China. Organic net sales from La Mer and Est\u00e9e Lauder propelled the category's growth led by strong campaigns behind our hero product franchises with new product innovation and increased in-store activations. Organic net sales in makeup increased 4%, largely driven by our Asia travel retail business and by Latin America. Net sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique led the category's growth fueled by ongoing activations behind our hero product franchises. This was partially offset by a prior year benefit from changes made to M\u00b7A\u00b7C's take-back loyalty program. Excluding the impact from the prior year benefit, M\u00b7A\u00b7C net sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all regions mainly driven by new product innovation. Organic net sales in fragrance increased 1% and in hair care declined 4%. In fragrance net sales growth was driven by our luxury and artisanal brands led by Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Jo Malone London grew double digits in travel retail and specialty-multi. Le Labo saw double-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer channels particularly in freestanding stores, driven by both same-door growth and targeted expanded consumer reach. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline from Est\u00e9e Lauder due to retail softness during holiday and key shopping moments. Our gross margin increased 280 basis points compared to last year. This reflects positive impacts from changes in category mix driven by the acceleration of skin care, lower obsolescence charges given the reduction in excess inventory compared to last year and stronger strategic price realization through lower levels of promotion. These improvements were partially offset as expected by the impact of the previous pull down of production that triggered a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs in the current period instead of when products are sold. This resulted in a 215 basis point headwind to gross margin. Foreign currency also pressured gross margin in the quarter. Operating expenses decreased 290 basis points as a percent of sales during the quarter, driven by the sales growth leverage and expense management including advertising and promotional expense, which decreased approximately 240 basis points compared to last year. This reduction reflects the anticipated shift in certain spending from the third quarter to the fourth to support innovation launches in key holiday moments in the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 75% to $554 million, and our operating margin expanded 570 basis points to 14.1%, compared to 8.4% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, compared to the elevated rate of 43.1% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate on our foreign operations due to the difference in timing of the estimated change in our full year geographical mix of earnings in the current and prior year periods. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Diluted EPS was $0.97 compared to $0.47 last year largely due to the increase in sales improvement in gross profit margin and a lower tax rate. The impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.01 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay royalties on the beauty business. For the nine months, we generated $1.5 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1 billion last year. The increase from last year reflects lower working capital, which was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce in-house inventory levels primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell. We invested $702 million in capital expenditures and we returned $710 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. As Fabrizio mentioned, our plans under the profit recovery plan are progressing and are on track. This quarter we began taking charges under the restructuring program and expect approval to accelerate in the fourth quarter of this year and throughout fiscal 2025 with meaningful benefits beginning to flow into our fiscal year 2025 results. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are pleased with our progress thus far in reducing inventory levels, resuming replenishment shipments in Asia travel retail, accelerating innovation and selectively expanding our consumer reach. These efforts have led to sequential improvements in both net sales and operating margin from the first half of the year, culminating in our return to profitable net sales growth this quarter. With these results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a stronger second half compared to last year, underscoring that we believe we are at a sales and profitability inflection point. While we delivered on the high end of our third quarter expectations, we are lowering our fiscal 2024 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility, including continued softness in Mainland China and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world. In Asia Travel Retail, we are also mindful of potential short-term volatility in retail sales related to actions certain retailers are taking to increase their profitability. With the recalibration between our third and fourth quarters, we discussed earlier we are maintaining our full year operating margin expectation and are increasing our EPS outlook slightly to reflect disciplined expense management year-to-date somewhat offset by our plans to strategically invest in key areas of our business in the fourth quarter to continue to drive profitable growth and reflecting incremental headwinds from foreign currency translation. The combination of our third quarter performance and outlook for the fourth quarter results in a strong second half compared to the first half with improvements in net sales and operating margin. Excluding the in-period charge we recognized in the third quarter, gross margin is also expected to improve in the second half. We believe our assumptions for the second half mark a meaningful turning point for the company, demonstrating the signs of our recovery and better position us along with our profit recovery plan initiatives to drive sales growth and profitability further in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Using March 29 spot rates of 1.079 for the euro, 1.262 for the pound, 7.227 for the Chinese Yuan; and 13.50 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We now expect organic net sales for our fourth quarter to increase 6% to 10% with increased consumer facing investments including shifts from the third quarter and aligned to support innovation in key shopping moments in the fourth quarter. This growth also reflects the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year, primarily in Hainan. In Mainland China, we expect the ongoing softness of overall prestige beauty to continue to pressure net sales. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.18 to $0.28, an increase of over 100%. Currency translation is expected to dilute EPS by $0.01 and potential risks of business disruptions in the Middle East are expected to be dilutive by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between $0.19 to $0.29. For the full year, we expect organic net sales to range between a 1% to 2% decline. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.14 and $2.24 before restructuring and other charges. Currency translation and potential risks of business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.09 and $0.06, respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to decrease between 33% to 36%. Our fiscal 2024 outlook also assumes the purchase of the remaining outstanding equity interest in DECIEM anticipated to be completed in May of 2024. In closing, our expected second half results starting with our strong third quarter performance demonstrate our progressive return to sales growth and profitability. We have navigated through numerous challenges over this past year with resilience and determination to take meaningful actions to begin to improve the trajectory of our business. Our results show we have made great strides and we have immense gratitude for the resolve and hard work of our teams globally. And while we are pleased with our progress and results this quarter, we remain keenly aware of the additional work that lies ahead to continue down the path of restoring stronger profit margins. We are intensely focused on doing the necessary work to return to long-term sustainable growth and profitability supported by the profit recovery plan initiatives and executed by our dedicated employees. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So Tracey, I just wanted to ask I guess a question about the 4Q guide and what's implied. So I guess, the implied margin in 4Q steps down from 3Q, yet the revenue will be roughly the same. It just implies maybe there's not as much leverage. But so if you can just give us some perspective on the margin step down quarter-to-quarter. And then as we think about the run rate into 2025 is there anything that we should read into the fourth quarter guide that would sort of inform exit rate for 2024 into 2025 both in terms of organic sales and margins. Thank you. Tracey Travis : Thanks, Bryan. When you think about the fourth quarter and what I said in my prepared remarks, I talked about some shifts that are occurring in the fourth quarter. So we did shift some advertising expense out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and that was to support some of the timing of the activity that we had in the fourth quarter both innovation as well as some of the holidays in the fourth quarter. I also talked about the fact that Travel Retail \u2013 Asia Travel Retail, we resumed shipments earlier than what we had expected in the third quarter. So there are \u2013 it's hard to look at Q3, Q4, you really need to look at the second half together because of some of those shifts. What's impacting our fourth quarter performance is \u2013 and the change in our guidance is softer growth of prestige beauty in Mainland China. The continued macro uncertainty that retailers are cautious in many markets have. We also have higher currency than what we had expected. So that is pressuring our EPS a bit as well. But when you look at the second half compared to prior guidance, what you will see is some of the expense savings that we realized and that I again talked about in my prepared remarks, we are actually flowing through. So we are offsetting some of the currency downside that we had and we're also offsetting some of the sales softness that is embedded in our updated guidance range. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. You mentioned several times that you've seen improvement towards targeted retail inventory levels in travel retail but not quite there yet. So can you talk about exit rate on the quarter more recent performance in Asia Travel Retail, particularly in Hainan and Korea and then also China both on and offline. And just what consumption looks like more recently your views on the 618 festival upcoming. It sounds like you're going to spend a bit more money on that than you had previously anticipated and just your outlook there. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : So, global trade retail return to growth also driven by frankly growth and retail growth across all the regions. So, the first important point is retail sales growth. And this was very, very strong in EMEA Americas in many parts of APAC and was single-digit in the China TR part. But this is a very important progress versus the past. And this is for Est\u00e9e companies brands is great news also for the future. The second thing that we are seeing is a very robust traffic recovery across the travel retail channel which is driving the sales to travelers there is work to be done still on conversion which is the areas of improvement that we are still working on, but we had a lot of work and progress in this by activations and retail division activating particularly in Hainan with a lot of activity and this activation are working. And so we see progress also in this area. And then as it was part of your question, because of all these elements strong improvement in the inventories in our retailers and so reaching the targets in several retailers and in several SKUs ahead of our original communicated target. So, at the end, this created a very good growth which is based on retail growth and sell into replenishment because of the decreased inventory levels versus the past. This combination is very solid. We expect this to continue and to progress in line with our goals. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. I just had a question about spending levels. It was great. Tracey thanks for being so specific on the advertising and the reinvestment this quarter and then shipped into 4Q. But if I remember in 3Q, there was also some timing shift on spend. So, I wanted to talk a little bit about maybe the decision tree of like when to put that spending in? Is it -- because if it's shifting is it about pace of getting innovation ready and launched? Is it about the consumer environment, maybe avoid putting money in play that would be like pushing on a string if the consumer isn't there. But it does feel like some of those spending plans are shifting gently quarter-to-quarter. And so I was curious if you could just comment on that. Thanks. Tracey Travis : Yes, well, you outlined a few of the reasons that we would make a decision to shift some of the spending. So, one of the things that we saw early in the quarter towards the middle of the quarter is that some of the holidays particularly in China were not performing as we had anticipated. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks holidays that are important for us Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day. We're closer this year, actually overlapped a bit than in prior years. Valentine's Day is actually a pretty strong gifting moment for us in China. Our team does a fantastic job of supporting Valentine's Day -- both Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day are less promotional holidays than some of the other holidays. But we didn't see the lift that we would normally see out of those holidays and trending into other holidays in the quarter we made the decision or the China team made the decision that it was best to shift some of that advertising to the fourth quarter and support some of the holidays that are upcoming in May and then obviously the big 618 holiday in June. So one of the things that we've talked about for a long time is the agility that we have created particularly in our advertising spend that allows us to take some of those decisions so that we can better match our advertising spend and when we think consumers will be reacting and responding whether it's to our gifting programs or our innovation programs. So that is what you saw in Lauren in the Q3 Q4 shift. Operator : Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, Tracey, I wanted to stick with that question, but perhaps look out more longer-term. Obviously, you mentioned higher investment in fiscal Q4 and the shift from Q3 and also you had better-than-expected expense management in Q3. So can you just take a step back and discuss the pace of reinvestment you expect behind the business over the next few years? How much of that is captured in the difference between gross and net savings and the profit recovery program? And then how the pace of that reinvestment fits with the savings from the profit recovery program and how you think about the savings. So, really the cadence annually looking at reinvestment versus savings as you look out over the next few years. And how they interrelate with each other? Tracey Travis : Great. No, thank you for the question. So, yes, let me take the opportunity to talk as you asked about the profit recovery plan. We're always focused on profitable growth, let me start there. The actions that we're taking both within the profit recovery plan as well as outside of the profit recovery plan are focused on profitable growth. The profit recovery plan is an accelerator of our growth and in particular an accelerator of our margins. And let me just try to simplify it a bit. I know we've said that we will share which we will more with you in August once our plans are complete and we provide guidance for the next year, but the profit recovery plan is first and foremost focused on restoration of our gross margin. Now we're mindful of shifts in category mix and channel mix relative to history. Obviously, we had growth in fragrance in our artisanal and luxury fragrance portfolio and that's very important. We're also focused on restoration of our makeup growth. But certainly as you saw in this past quarter, we are also experiencing the acceleration of our very important skin care category, and we expect that that will continue. The biggest drain on our margin has been our gross margin. And it's in the aftermath of the pandemic. It has been the biggest focus of our recovery, and we are focused on price realization. Part of that will be driven by the actions that we are taking in terms of inventory management to control discounts in excess and obsolescence. You saw a bit of the results of that in Q3. And you will see certainly more of that in fiscal 2025. So that is a very big focus of our profit recovery plan, the focus on restoration of our gross margins. We're also focused on supply chain efficiencies that will help our gross margins and accretive innovation. And we talked about some of the processes in Fabrizio's prepared remarks that we are deploying and strengthening in order to be able to do that. The second area of focus is greater leverage of our expense base. We have efforts in indirect procurement in terms of accelerating some of the savings there. And we have -- are taking some difficult decisions as it relates to rightsizing and streamlining parts of our organization and that's the restructuring program that we spoke to you about before. That is really the combination of that should drive the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit over two years. And again, we said that slightly more of that will happen in fiscal '25 then in '26. And again, in terms of the mix of where that recovery is expected more in gross profit margin, but also in our operating expenses. But I want to take the opportunity to talk about a couple of other benefits as it relates to the profit recovery plan. So in addition to the margin recovery, the program is expected to fund additional investment to your point for growth namely in consumer activation, more consumer activation for our brand. So the expectation is, we are going to save more than the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion that we are committing to in terms of operating profit improvement in order to also increase some of our advertising spend retarget and selectively against the momentum that we see in our business. And last, but not least, we expect to streamline and reduce some of the complexity in the organization that is built up over time in our processes and that's expected to increase our speed, agility and effectiveness in our markets. And I know our organization in particular very much looks forward to this benefit. So, it's a powerful program. I'm glad you asked about it. When we deliver on all elements of it and we will share more in terms of helping with the modeling of it in August. Operator : Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hey good morning everyone. I had a question on the Mainland China business. You clearly mentioned strong start in January, but then a deceleration. You mentioned that the exit rate has been soft in the country. So maybe you can comment particularly like, what you've seen more recently from a category growth standpoint, promotional activity levels and maybe market share? And then maybe longer term, if you take a step back, based on your analysis on the market, what do you think has been the main driver of the weakness? Is it mainly macro related? Is it more trade down in the category? Or are competitors doing better? Any sense of what the drivers of this slowdown will be helpful. Thank you. Fabrizio Freda : Yes, sure. On the -- in this moment, the slowdown, the softness is the overall prestige market. And that's what is softer than what we originally expected and that's what is stuck in Mainland China. What I want to clarify is that, we need to look at the -- we do look at the Chinese consumers in total and not only the segmentation the market does. So there is a Mainland China's consumers, there is Hong Kong SR. There is the TR China which includes Hainan for example in other parts and there are the international traveling people, which for tourism or business travel from China to Tokyo, Paris et cetera. So, we see actually progress in the total Chinese consumer consumption on our brands and they are very solid. And when you took Mainland plus the progress in Hong Kong SIL plus the TR China retail progress that I was speaking about in the previous question, plus the success we see of our brands internationally the Chinese travelers now are growing more for example in Japan, for example in Paris. And so when you put all these numbers and frankly, they are all solid numbers, except the international travelers in other cities, which is an estimate in our model, but we see clear progress and there is progress between quarter two and quarter three despite the softness in Mainland, and there is actually their turn positive, very interestingly positive in quarter four estimates for the future. So, the trends are also depend by channel. And the drivers, first of all, at different consumers, the consumers that travel both for vacation and internationally tend to have been the high end. In this moment, the softness is more in the middle in the consumer sentiment of the middle class. We tend to be shopping more in Mainland and these channels follow different trends and different -- depending on the moment, depending on the situation, but the equities of the brands are strong, as seen by the overall progress, particularly certain brands which are doing -- growing in the total already as we speak and continue to accelerate in our portfolio. And the future of the -- this is positive. There is a sense of recovery in the overall consumption, although via channel, there are different percentages, different evolution, and this can be different also by quarter, by semester, depending on the various trends that happen. So we look internally to the Chinese consumer as a whole and not only to the various parts. Then your question was what have been the key drivers behind this. Now, one of the key drivers, obviously is the skin care trend, and the fact that in the post-COVID, the consumers have been having -- are having a period where they're focusing more on experiences -- on overall experiences a consumption spending in their portfolio on overall experience like travel like other categories or like restaurants or like things like that. So this will evolve, is evolving in every single market after COVID and become more balanced over time. That's our experience, and that's visible already. So that's one of the drivers. It's the consumer priority by category and experiences versus goods. The second thing is the -- we are accelerating innovation in a big way. We have invested in a R&D center in China. We see the results of this innovation, but with the first innovation coming from the R&D center will be in quarter four, and we will see the impact of it, which is very dedicated to specific Chinese consumers, so part of the drivers has been the amount of innovation and the quality of innovation that can be deployed for quality, I mean, also local relevancy of the innovation and this is an improving trend. It is already enforcement trend, which gives very, very solid indications for the future. So the other driver has been promotionality. The market has been during COVID promotional, but in this moment, all the activities that the governments have decided to do on the structured market is reducing the level of structure market also the price increases that many of the retailers are taking also in travel retail are in the short-term are impacting the consumption ,particularly the middle class level in Mainland. But on the contrary in the long-term will further balance the proportion between a structure and structured market, which is obviously in line with our goals and is the objective. So it's a positive long-term trend, which is happening. But the market will remain promotional. And so that's why we have the activation of promotionality particularly in the area of sampling, gifting to the points that Tracey was making before is on an increase and the level of discounts is on a decreased trend and that's the change in the proportionality model. But all-in-all, I just want to make sure that we understand that despite the short-term softness of the market in Mainland China, the overall trend of Chinese consumers is positive and this trend is expected to accelerate in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Powers : Yes, hey good morning, Fabrizio and Tracey. Thanks for the question. So I wanted to clarify, I think Olivia had asked about it, but on the trade inventory in China, it sounds like on certain SKUs, certain parts of the portfolio you're ahead of schedule and clearing that inventory backlog. But the total portfolio seems like it didn't quite hit that April 1st target you had. So is that the right read and just your confidence in being able to ship to consumption across the total portfolio in the fourth quarter? Is that intact? Or is that part of the lower organic outlook for the fourth quarter versus what was implied back in December. The second question that I really want to\u2026 Tracey Travis : Yeah, no. Steve Powers : Sorry go ahead, Tracey. And I can follow-up if that's okay. Tracey Travis : No, no, go ahead with your second question, Steve. Steve Powers : Well, that was a clarification. So I want to put Clinique on Amazon. Historically, you've cited for a long time hurdles launching on that platform that were at least to me a combination of questions around achievable unit economics on that platform, the brand experience for consumers and being able to curate that effectively. And then just your own visibility into the required consumer insights. So just to the extent that that's correct, how did you overcome those hurdles and get to a point where Clinique on Amazon in your mind is the right time for that? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay, Steve. So I'll take the first part of that question on the inventory in Asia Travel Retail and Fabrizio will take the Amazon Clinique follow-up question. Regarding the inventory in trade in Asia Travel Retail, we did reach the objectives that we had in the third quarter actually before April. And so the reason that we ended up shifting a bit more from -- or doing a bit more from a replenishment standpoint in the third quarter is because we actually reached those levels a bit earlier than what we had anticipated. We anticipate reaching them by April, which is the beginning of the fourth quarter obviously, and we reached them within the third quarter. So that is the reason why some of the shipments were a bit higher in the third quarter and we will expect the retail sell-through in the fourth quarter. And so \u2013 and as Fabrizio mentioned, we are expecting as well an acceleration of retail in the fourth quarter. Just remember for the cadence of what we're anniversarying we actually had some disruption even in the fourth quarter as it related to Hainan last year. So we are going to see a bit of a disconnect between retail and net for a couple of quarters because of the significance of the interruptions that we had both at the beginning of the third quarter last year and the end of the fourth quarter last year, as well. And so we would expect that net will as we replenish relative to the comparison year-over-year to last year then that would be ahead of retail but we will be maintaining the inventory levels in the range that we and our retailers have agreed to. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. And on Clinique-Amazon I want to say, one of the important progress we are making on Clinique is the initiative of building on Clinique heritage in active derma and relaunch the brands in North America and UK in this moment and globally soon on this overall platform. The Amazon introduction in the US is also right for Clinique in the context of this big launch because a lot of new consumers that are very high consumers of active derma are also in this chart. Amazon provides expanded consumer reach a lot of new consumers we expect to recruit, to engage and to educate new consumer by this new channel. Amazon in this moment is a fast-growing online platform in the US and the premium Beauty store has been clearly a contributor to the overall market growth and particularly has been an important brand discovery for some consumers and also consumers are new consumers to Clinique. And so the early results are very promising. And the first period has been extraordinarily positive frankly and we have expectation that this will continue and will accelerate over time. So part of your question why was the right moment now, I think because now the model of Amazon has evolved in a situation where there is a better fit between the Clinique brands and the Amazon model and the opportunity to communicate the heritage, the equity, the education and the various ideas behind the science of active derma of Clinique is now there. And so we believe the brand can express its fundamentals correctly on the platform and the work that the Clinique team has done in providing amazing asset quality of execution to achieve a very good quality expression of the brand on the platform also reassured us that is the right moment and is a very good fit. And as I said initial results are confirming that. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. I have a question for Fabrizio and then one clarification for Tracy. Fabrizio, I have a question on the US sales. If you're seeing any acceleration in shipments as you exit the quarter, it seems that the third quarter was still negative excluding the strength in Brazil and Mexico. So, I wonder if you can comment on how this innovation that you're putting and more money behind M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique has been handing out as you exit the quarter? And also a clarification for Tracey. I appreciate all the details of the profit recovery into fiscal 2025. By my math roughly the $700 million operating profit benefit at the midpoint. Should we be thinking of this benefit being mostly spread with seasonality and excluding the shorter quarters or mostly back half weighted as you do this plan? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So, I'll take your last part of the question first. We'll give more guidance on the calendarization of the profit recovery plan in August. We're still -- we're well into the finalization of some of those plans and making taking some decisions within the next couple of months. So, we'll be able to provide you with much better guidance on calendarization in the August time frame. Fabrizio Freda : Yes. On the U.S. -- no, I think -- actually U.S. in quarter three has been growing low single -- sorry North America in quarter three is growing low single-digit. And if you exclude the M\u00b7A\u00b7C loyalty program actually it's getting closer to mid-single-digits. So, is -- there is growth in North America in quarter three. Said this, there is softness in consumer sentiment in this moment and the market growth is moderating in North America. So, obviously, there is pressure in -- particularly in certain channels. There is pressure but the quarter three was in the right direction and it was in line with our goals. And for us the positive is that we had for example a positive impact on Clinique on the part of March. And in this part of March, already we saw the impact of that -- positive impact of that. If we -- you can assume that we will have in the full quarter four, the impact of Clinique on Amazon, this for example, will be a positive element in the mix. We assure that. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join for the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 :00 P.M. Eastern Time today through May 15th. To hear a recording of the call please dial 877-344-7529 using passcode 5758677. That concludes today's Est\u00e9e Lauder conference call.

For opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin. Rainey Mancini : Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our report filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures on our press release and on the investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. Throughout our discussion, our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan will be referred to as our PRGP. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now, I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rain, and hello to everyone. Today, we will review our results for fiscal year 2024, which represented a difficult year for the company and discuss the implementation of our strategy reset to drive improving performance in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. After a challenging first half, we returned to top line growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 with organic sales growth accelerating from 6% in the third quarter to 8% in the fourth quarter. And we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 11.6%. This level of profitability was higher than the first half and expanded from the second half of fiscal year 2023. All told, for fiscal year 2024, our organic sales declined 2%, we achieved modest gross margin expansion and adjusted operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 10.2%. These results were in line with the revised outlook we offered in May for sales and better than expected for operating profitability despite the further softening of the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. That said, we remain unsatisfied with this performance. Looking ahead, our fiscal year 2025 outlook reflects continued declines in the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. While the PRGP, which remains on track relatively to our previously stated goals, enable us to offset the pressure to profitability from declines in areas of our business that have high penetration of skin care, it yields a slower pace of operating margin expansions for fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected when we expanded the PRGP in February. For fiscal year 2025, in the rest of our global business, we are planning to deliver improved performance across both developed and emerging markets. To fuel this, our strategic priorities are reigniting skin care, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrance, moving faster in leveraging winning channels, launching accretive innovation inclusive of new, big opportunities and enhancing our precision marketing capabilities for increased effectiveness and efficiency of our consumer facing investments. The PRGP enables and accelerates these strategy priorities and is the foundation to restore sustainable long-term organic sales growth and to rebuild our operating profitability. We are also creating a faster and leaner organization that will more quickly adapt to market dynamics and be better able to leverage future growth. While our sales and profit outlook for fiscal year 2025 is disappointing, this year we will make important strides as we implement our strategy reset to continue rebalancing regional growth, deliver improved annual profitability, strengthen go-to-market and innovation capabilities to elevate our execution in response to a more competitive market. These efforts will position us to both outperform the prestige beauty industry in fiscal year 2026 and accelerate profitability expansion. Let me now describe the drivers of our fiscal year 2025 outlook before discussing our strategic priorities in greater detail. The prestige beauty industry reported retail sales trends in mainland China, further weakening sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of mid-single-digit in the third quarter to a decrease of low double-digits. As the consumer confidence remains subdued, importantly, we gained share in the prestige beauty industry in mainland China in the fourth quarter, driven by La Mer and Estee Lauder progress in the market's far largest category of skin care. Retail sales trend for the prestige beauty industry in Asia travel retail also did not improve during the fourth quarter. This was most notable in Hainan, where retail sales in the beauty market declined over 40% despite a more favorable comparison to the previous period as the quarter unfolded. For Hainan and Asia travel retail overall, as traffic returns, conversion levels remained subdued and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels owing to weak consumer sentiment reducing basket sizes, and to an extent, consumer diversity spending to experiences. The US prestige beauty industry retail sales growth accelerated each month throughout the fourth quarter, albeit with growth at a still compelling pace of mid-to-high single digits. Encouragingly, our company retail sales returned to growth. While we continue to see the prestige beauty share driven by the extent of our exposure to slower growth channels, our share loss was reduced in the fourth quarter. This reflects gains from gradually increasing our exposure to high growth channels like Amazon and specialty-multi. And this trend was further reinforced in July when our company retail sales growth accelerated to mid-single-digits driven by double digit growth in fragrance and hair care. Moreover, the company retail sales improved to mid-single-digit growth in skin care and we gained share in the category in July. For fiscal year 2025, we forecast the global prestige beauty industry to grow 2% to 3%, reflecting ongoing strengths in many developed and emerging markets globally. The market in the west, which collectively exited fiscal year 2024 relatively strongly, are primed to drive the industry performance. The markets in the east in total are expected to be tempered as strengths in Japan and Southeast Asia is offset by ongoing declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail. We expect the global prestige beauty industry to reaccelerate to historical mid-single-digit growth in fiscal year 2026, assuming China progressively stabilizes and then returns to growth. With this industry landscape and given the size of our business in some areas most challenged, our fiscal year 2025 organic sales growth outlook range is in a decline of 1% to an increase of 2%. Our organic sales growth outlook reflects an acceleration in several areas of business, partially offset by declines in mainland China and Asia travel detail. For our first quarter, the pressure is more acute, such that our organic sales outlook calls for a decline which Tracey will describe in further detail. For fiscal year 2025, we are refocusing consumer facing investment on the biggest opportunity, streamlining our organization to be faster and more agile in order to fuel the organic sales growth momentum we have in many areas of our business across developed and emerging markets. We also intend to better leverage the strengths of our brands in North America where we are leaders in prestige makeup, which is the region's biggest category and where we hold the top two ranked brands. And in prestige skincare, adding four of the top five ranked brands. Moreover, in North America, we also intend to leverage the market strengths across generations as we focus a balanced contribution to industry growth by age. Looking at our strategic priorities for fiscal year 2025, let me begin with skin care, which represents over 50% of our sales and is our most profitable product category. Our initiatives are designed to enable us to even better leverage our top ranked global prestige skin care portfolio to welcome new consumers and further engage our loyal consumers through elevated precision marketing, a robust accretive innovation pipeline and expanded reach in high growth channels. This starts with The Ordinary, which entered fiscal year 2025 with momentum, having growth in its organic sales by more than 20% in fiscal year 2024. The Ordinary is leading the way among our brands in capitalizing on white spaces opportunity in products, channels, and geographies. In the fourth quarter, The Ordinary launched its first product in lip care, executed a hugely successful TikTok Shop Super Brand Day campaign in the US and established its footprint in Japan. For fiscal year 2025, The Ordinary has already newly entered the body care subcategory and is preparing to expand into more emerging markets given its proven successful launches in India, the Middle East and South Africa over the last two years. Among the brands we are incubating, a star in fiscal year 2024 was NIOD in skincare. The brand has a promising future. Clinique is making great strides, executing its strategy to double down on its authentic dermatologist heritage. Clinique begun this work in the US and UK this past spring and has been expanding its global rollout. This includes its successful launch on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store in March. Impressively, Clinique has returned to share growth in the US prestige skincare with three consecutive months of gains through July. Clinique performance in US retail in July was particularly impressive, with the brand\u2019s skincare brand and makeup outperforming across subcategories and Clinique retaking the number one rank in overall prestige beauty. La Mer, along with Estee Lauder and Re-Nutriv franchise, [indiscernible] our luxury skincare strategy. With both brands poised to build on their successful in -- of fiscal year 2024 during which La Mer exceptional growth made it our best performing brand. For Re-Nutriv, we plan to build upon this fiscal year 2024 the launches of the new moisturizer and serum foundation this year through an expanded product portfolio focused on the science of skin longevity and visible age reversal. With The Ordinary, Clinique, Estee Lauder and La Mer, we are bringing to market in fiscal year 2025 a rich innovation pipeline focused on the benefits of nighttime skincare ritual, which is an incremental use education. Our brand portfolio strategically addresses various skin concerns and types with targeted ingredients and claims designed to appeal to a diverse range of consumer segments because of price and product position. Let me now turn to our next strategic priority, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrances where our luxury and artisanal portfolio of Jo Malone London, TOM FORD, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS, Frederic Malle and AERIN Beauty collectively rose mid-single-digit organically in fiscal year 2024. The luxury tier of the fragrance category where we are number one ranked was the best performing tier in retail sales in fiscal year 2024 and we expect this to be the case again in fiscal year 2025. We are focused on further realizing the growth potential of high-end fragrances, given its broad based trends around the world to drive greater scale for the company. From Le Labo\u2019s outstanding performance in fiscal year 2024 led by Asia Pacific where its organic sales nearly doubled, to Jo Malone London's disruptive campaign with Tom Hardy to drive its men's business and we are well positioned to build on our momentum. Our brands have distribution expansion and compelling newness slated not only in the scent but also in the form and size to trade consumer into the luxury tier and we are thrilled to be expanding our luxury portfolio with the September launch of the Balmain Beauty brand which chose the fragrance category to begin its journey. We are also focused on driving accelerated sales growth in the prestige tier of the fragrance category with our Estee Lauder and Clinique brands with broad rich go-to-market activation slated for this and upcoming quarters. Let me turn our strategic priority of winning in fast growing channels globally. To do so, our mindset has shifted to more boldly merchandising our brands where consumers are increasingly discovering the shopping for beauty while executing with excellence and staying true to our high touch approach. While this encompasses both brick-and-mortar and online, today I will share with you examples from online. In the US, our launches of Clinique, Too Faced, and Bumble and bumble, on the Amazon Premium Beauty store in the second house epitomized this philosophy. Clinique launched with a skin analysis tool in March, and by June, had expanded to offer live chat with the Clinique ambassador while Bumble and bumble launched with extensive hair education from the brand\u2019s expert stylists. All three brands are off to a very strong start on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store. Clinique and, Bumble and bumble, are seeing promising uptake also with male consumers. And for Clinique, where we now have a full quarter of performance, we are encouraged by the extent of consumers subscribing for future purchases as well as the strong level of repeat purchases in the quarter. So far, in fiscal year 2025, Dr.Jart+, Smashbox and Lab Series have already opened storefronts in the US, and we have more launches on the horizon. Around the world, we are building growth momentum with social commerce, driving new consumer acquisition by engaging consumers where they're spending their time, leveraging a content-focused approach with live streaming and short-form videos and activating full funnel integration of social media and commerce. In China, we have scaled and sustained strong growth on the win with more brand launches later for fiscal year '25. Looking at Japan and Korea, we are further unlocking platform opportunities for our brand with [Line and Rakuten] (ph), and accelerating social commerce on Kakao with focus on gifting. Our final strategic initiative is enhancing our precision marketing capabilities, enabling us to be more focused on new consumer acquisition. From brand equity to product assortment, distribution and media, we are better able to target new consumers and also to accelerate the effectiveness of acquisition and efficiency spend. This capability has been designed to leverage data, including over 200 million consumers profiles we have built over the years and exclusive partnerships with AI leaders. Precision marketing is also allowing us to be far more nimble with trend to action. During fiscal year 2024, we began pilot studying in market around the world to marry trends with our rich portfolio of existing products and innovation to activate against trends with speed. We realized promising results, including successes with the peach makeup and bronzing trends. We have now formalized this process and developed the trend AI tool to enable our brand teams around the world to quickly drive trends to action. In closing, we have designed our strategy reset to position the company for a stronger future. We are wholly focused on executing with excellence across these strategic initiatives and our PRGP to again realize the proven performance of our company. To our employees, I extend my deep gratitude for your commitment amid a challenging time for our company. And now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. We navigated through another challenging year across several areas of our business and took specific actions to more sustainably improve our sales and profit results as it became apparent that the recovery that was anticipated to occur throughout the year in some of our markets was impacted by far more volatility. And while we returned to growth in the second half, primarily driven by resumed shipments in Asia travel retail, we are certainly not pleased with our overall full year results, and on top of global prestige volatility, the execution of our strategy has not met our expectations in some key areas of our business. During the year, we also largely completed the basic design and began the implementation of our multiyear PRGP to deliver stronger results against our expectation or a more gradual rebuilding of sales growth along with an acceleration in profitability. Before I discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook, let me first share with you the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year results. Our fourth quarter organic net sales increased by 8% compared to last year, meeting our expectations, albeit with a different geographical mix than we anticipated, which reflected lower results in mainland China and North America due notably to further softening in overall prestige beauty in both of these markets. A combination of tentative consumer sentiment in China and consumer inflationary pressures in North America are believed to have contributed to the deceleration in both markets. Diluted EPS rose to $0.64 from $0.07 last year, exceeding our expectations, largely due to our operating performance and the reduction in our full year effective tax rate. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales rose 32% in EMEA, primarily driven by the increase in our Asia travel retail business, given the favorable comparison to the prior year period as shipments increased over last year's extremely low level. In addition, organic net sales increased in both our developed European and priority emerging markets. Organic net sales in Asia Pacific decreased 4%, primarily driven by the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty in mainland China as well as lower shipments in Hong Kong SAR as we anniversaried the initial surge in sales with the border reopening in the prior year period. Outside of these markets, net sales rose strong double-digits in Japan as a favorable currency, coupled with strong in-market activation and expanded consumer reach attracted both domestic and traveling consumers and bolstered growth across all product categories in nearly all channels of distribution. In the Americas, organic net sales decreased 5% driven by the decline in North America, reflecting the ongoing intensely competitive environment as well as an overall slowdown in growth in prestige beauty, especially in brick-and-mortar channels, which particularly impacted our skin care makeup categories. Online sales grew mid-single-digits in the region, benefiting from both retailer.com growth and the launch of select brands, specialty Clinique on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store. From a product category perspective, skincare organic net sales increased 15%, primarily due to the increased shipments within the Asia travel retail business referenced earlier, which drove net sales growth from both La Mer and Estee Lauder. Organic net sales from The Ordinary also increased across all geographic regions. Makeup organic net sales increased 1%. Net sales increased from Estee Lauder, benefiting from the resumption of shipments in our Asia travel retail business and the continued global success of the Double Wear product franchise. Clinique net sales rose strong double-digits, fueled by the Almost lipstick product franchise. Partially offsetting these increases were declines from M\u00b7A\u00b7C and TOM FORD. Organic net sales increased 2% in hair care and 1% in fragrance. Regarding fragrance, net sales growth was driven by the ongoing consumer appeal of Le Labo's unique product offerings and targeted expanded consumer reach and Jo Malone, partially offset by declines in Estee Lauder and Clinique. Our gross margin expanded 380 basis points to 71.8% compared to last year. This increase primarily reflected lower obsolescence and overhead charges as well as higher skincare sales. Operating expenses decreased 340 basis points as a percent of sales to 62.7%, driven largely by the increase in net sales, improved gross margin and lower general and administrative expenses. During the quarter, we recorded $471 million of impairment charges related to Dr.Jart+ given the continued lower-than-expected growth and profitability of the brand. We made the decision to exit the brand from its heavily discounted travel retail channel and prioritize direct investments in other more profitable areas of the business, including in mainland China and Western markets where a broader assortment of the brand has been resonating well with consumers. Operating income increased to $349 million and our operating margin expanded 700 basis points to 9% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% compared to a negative 17.9% last year, the latter having had a larger year-end true-up to reflect our final effective tax rate for the fiscal year of 2023. Our rate was better than anticipated this year, primarily due to the shift in our geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS increased to $0.64 from $0.07 last year due largely to the improvement in our operating results, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the increase in our effective tax rate. Foreign currency translation was $0.03 dilutive to EPS in the quarter and the impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.02 dilutive. Turning now to our full year results. Although we saw growth in the second half, our full year results highlight both volatility and the impact of our own challenges in some key areas of our business. Collectively, the pressure in Mainland China from the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty, the necessary actions we took in Asia travel retail during the first half of the year to reduce high trade inventory levels in a prolonged soft retail environment, and continued pressure from the competitive environment, particularly in North America, outweighed the solid growth we saw during the year in our EMEA and LatAm markets. Organic net sales decreased 2%, primarily due to the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty in mainland China, leading to a 3% decline in Asia Pacific. The challenges in Asia travel retail also pressured sales, resulting in a 2% decline in EMEA as our return to growth in Asia travel retail in the second half was not enough to offset the first half decline due in part to retail trends decelerating throughout the second half in China. Net sales in the Americas was overall flat compared to last year. From a category perspective, skincare net sales declined 3%, largely due to the declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail and makeup decreased 1%, also reflecting these challenges as well as a prior year benefit from changes made to M\u00b7A\u00b7C's take-back loyalty program. Net sales fell 4% in hair care and rose 2% in fragrance. Confronted with the volatility throughout the year, just discussed, our teams attempted to balance cost efficiency actions with consumer-facing investments to support growth. Net sales with our specialty multi-retailers and in our freestanding stores, each grew double digits. Global travel retail represented 19% of our reported sales in fiscal 2024 and online net sales represented 28%. Our gross margin improved 30 basis points to 71.7% compared to 71.4% last year, reflecting the initiatives we took throughout the year to reduce excess and obsolete inventory as well as changes in brand mix. Partially offsetting this progress was an unfavorable impact from foreign currency and the impact from the under-absorption of overhead in our plants due to the necessary pull down of production earlier in the year. Operating expenses increased 160 basis points to 61.5% of sales, reflecting deleverage from the sales decline, including our investments to support targeted expanded consumer reach globally and to support growth where we had momentum. Operating income declined 13% to $1.6 billion from $1.8 billion last year, and our operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 10.2% for the full year. Our effective tax rate for the year was 31% compared to 26.5% last year, reflecting a higher effective tax rate on our foreign operations due to the geographical mix of our earnings and the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Net earnings was $935 million and diluted EPS was $2.59, both declining 25% compared to last year. Foreign currency translation was $0.10 dilutive to EPS and the impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.06 dilutive. We generated $2.4 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.7 billion last year. The increase reflects improvements in working capital, which was largely due to the actions we took to reduce in-house inventory levels. We utilized $919 million for capital investments and returned $947 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. After our initial minority investment in DECIEM in 2017 and then increasing our investment to become a majority owner in 2021, we are pleased to have completed, subject to finalization of the purchase price, our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in DECIEM this past May for $859 million, of which $829 million was paid as of June 30, 2024. Looking ahead now to our outlook for fiscal 2025. While acknowledging some initial bright spots related to pivots in our strategy, we are cognizant that overall global prestige beauty growth has tempered in recent months as reflected in the current declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan. Prestige beauty has also moderated in some of our major markets like North America. And while we believe we have the right priorities for growth, we are also mindful of the level of variability that continues to exist in many of our markets. Accordingly, we are reflecting a more subdued recovery of growth in fiscal 2025, which you have seen in this morning's press release. The PRGP remains a critical element in our ability to deliver margin expansion and ultimately is designed to put in place the cost structure necessary for the company to drive stronger leverage in its business on lower than our normal growth expectations this year. This should also yield even greater flow-through of benefits to profit as net sales progressively return to higher growth in future years. In fiscal 2024, we had already approved actions to begin addressing overcapacity in parts of our supply chain, inclusive of streamlining manufacturing and distribution costs where we could react more quickly and to simplify certain areas of our overhead structure. Our PRGP initiatives are focused on three primary benefit areas for the company, first, accelerating margin expansion through both gross margin recovery and additional expense leverage while also enabling additional cash generation for the company. Second, creating additional fuel for growth with targeted investments in consumer-facing activities. And third, simplifying our processes and creating more agility and speed in execution. We have begun executing against many initiatives within these three areas of benefit for the company. Regarding margin expansion, the significant pull down of production we did at the beginning of last year to bring manufacturing levels well below our shipment trends in order to reduce our inventory level has already yielded cash benefits in fiscal 2024. This has also resulted in additional benefits from reduced discounts and obsolescence costs and lower levels of expenses are expected to continue into fiscal 2025. Additionally, this year, we are planning to realize greater net benefits from our strategic pricing actions through less discounts and promotions with our enhanced focus on precision marketing. These actions, along with the benefits of more accretive innovation, particularly in skincare, support the gross margin expansion we expect this year. Additionally, regarding expense leverage, with our expectation of a slower return to growth, there is increased leverage pressure from our fixed costs. We are executing against our restructuring program and have already approved initiatives to reduce spans and layers in certain parts of our business. Furthermore, we are expanding our existing shared services capabilities to support the simplification and standardization of key processes and scale capabilities faster, as well as rationalizing the breadth of distribution choices across our existing portfolio of brands. We have also negotiated savings across many of our spending areas and are already realizing savings in areas like transportation. Lastly, we are taking this opportunity of the PRGP to address some of the ways we work to simplify decision-making and enhance our agility and go-to-market execution to be faster in this ever-changing dynamic global prestige beauty environment. More to come on this in a future earnings call. Also, we anticipate at this point that approximately 80% of the net benefits realized from the PRGP in fiscal 2025 are targeted to improve gross profit, with the remaining 20% targeted to reduce certain operating expenses. This mix is likely to shift in fiscal 2026 as more of our expense actions contribute favorably to our overall expense structure, given the expected cadence of initiatives. We also expect to take restructuring and other charges of at least approximately $100 million to $120 million in fiscal 2025 from approved initiatives with additional charges expected during the course of the year as more initiatives are finalized and approved. However, with modest sales growth expected in fiscal 2025, as I indicated before, we will unfortunately also experience a greater amount of fixed expense de-leverage in addition to the unfavorable mix pressure from softer sales performance in some of our higher-margin categories and regions. And as we communicated, we are protecting a portion of the savings we generate from the PRGP to reinvest selectively in advertising and store activation to fuel growth with the brands and regions where we have momentum, and support the growth we are currently experiencing with active derm, luxury fragrance and distribution expansion in faster growth channels. We began this fiscal year with our team fully immersed and committed to executing initiatives across all pillars of the PRGP now that we are post the completion of our design phase. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit from the full PRGP. And while we are focused on realizing slightly more than half of the net benefits in 2025, additional savings initiatives may be required as lower sales volumes are realized. Overall, we expect to progress margin expansion at an accelerated pace as a result of the plan by delivering annual margin expansion greater than our pre-pandemic historical average, inclusive of creating additional fuel to accelerate sales growth at a faster pace as well. Accordingly, fiscal 2025 is projected to be a year of transition for the company, navigating continued macroeconomic softness and challenges in a few key areas of our business, while accelerating growth where we have momentum and executing against our real -- and realizing anticipated benefits from the PRGP. Our strategic imperatives for the year, as mentioned by Fabrizio, are focused on leveraging the inherent strengths we have across our brands, categories, regions and talented employees. Over the next few years, Western markets, along with Asia Pacific markets outside of China, are expected to drive a greater portion of our long-term profitable growth as we deepen our focus on fast-growing channels in these markets. We have the opportunity to leverage our skincare brands with strong lux and active derm appeal, expand the consumer reach of our luxury fragrance portfolio, capture more relevant trends with our makeup brands and reenergize our hair care brands, all with an eye towards capturing additional consumers while retaining loyal ones. We also plan to begin leveraging our regional lines manufacturing and distribution network in Asia to create greater inventory agility as demand dictates. With that backdrop in mind and using August 12 spot rates of 1.092 for the euro, 1.276 for the pound, 7.167 for the Chinese yuan, and [1,364] (ph) for the Korean won and full fiscal year organic net sales are forecasted to range between a decrease of 1% and an increase of 2%. Throughout this past fiscal year, to mitigate the expected pressures to our business, we accelerated the implementation of initiatives under our PRGP as I previously mentioned, which we expect, combined with our sales growth range to result in most of our margin expansion for the full year to be realized in gross margin. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 32%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.75 and $2.95 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.03 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to grow by approximately 7% to 15%. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecasted between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% to 5.5% of forecasted net sales. We expect our first quarter results to be pressured by the ongoing challenges in mainland China and Asia travel retail we experienced as we exited fiscal 2024, mainly as subdued consumer sentiment, more experiential spending and lower conversion rates continue. We are, however, seeing some early signs of progress, particularly in North America, as Fabrizio mentioned, with our strategic pivots and assuming the progressive return of prestige beauty sales growth in mainland China and Asia travel retail, we anticipate overall improvement over the course of the year. With that backdrop for our first quarter, we currently expect organic net sales to fall 3% to 5%. At this time, we expect first quarter diluted EPS of $0.02 to $0.10 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.01 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS of $0.01 to $0.09. Assuming a full year global prestige beauty performance in fiscal year 2025 of 2% to 3%, our remaining three quarters are anticipated to meet or slightly exceed this growth which is in line with our previous sales performance objective of exceeding the overall average of global prestige beauty growth by at least 1 point. With the implementation of our PRGP initiatives and if global prestige beauty accelerates further in fiscal 2026, the combination of additional sales momentum and margin accretion leverage from our PRGP should provide further progress toward returning to a more sustainable sales and profit growth algorithm. In closing, while our fiscal 2024 performance was disappointing. We remain focused on navigating the current volatile global prestige beauty dynamics, while leveraging the long-term strengths of our brands, and we maintain confidence in our strategic pivots and the execution of our PRGP to drive profitable growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond. I want to personally thank our teams globally for their resilience, commitment and dedication to the company through another difficult year. Before I turn the call back over to Fabrizio for a few final comments, as most of you know, I announced my planned retirement at the end of this fiscal year. Accordingly, I want to congratulate Akhil Srivastava on his appointment as CFO effective November 1. I look forward to working with him over this transition period and appreciate his commitment to the company and its ongoing success. And now, I'll turn it back to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Tracey. And I want to make a final comment before we turn to Q&A. Today, I announced my intention to retire from Estee Lauder companies. It has been a privilege, a great honor to lead the company for 16 years, I have been deeply enriched by exceptional colleagues around the world, and I take this decision to retire with gratitude for all we have accomplished. I have two primary objectives ahead of my retirement. First, I intend to execute with excellent strategy reset that the Tracey and I described today, inclusive of our profit recovery and growth plan. It is important to me that our next leader inherits a business with momentum. Second, I plan to work closely with our Board of Directors and my successor, once named, to ensure a smooth transition. My passion for our beautiful company is as strong as ever, and I'm confident in its bright future. Throughout the years, I've deeply enjoyed representing the company with analysts and investors. I look forward to our continued engagement until I retire. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Powers : Great. Thank you so much. There's a lot to cover. But, Fabrizio, maybe we can pick up where you left off, as you -- both you and Tracey both outlined a very challenging and transformational time for the company. As you personally look ahead at the priorities facing Estee Lauder, how are you thinking about -- or how would you frame the most important attributes that you'd look for in your successor? And how closely will you be involved over the coming months and quarters finding that successor. Fabrizio Freda : Sure. As I said in the prepared remarks, I will be very involved with the Board in working on the succession. And obviously, as you know, it's the Board responsibility to decide the successor, but we are working all together to get the best output out of the work done for some time. This is a long-term process. It's not something that we are just starting working now, obviously. And in terms of the characteristic of the successor, I think the successor has to be obviously a great leader and understand the key elements of our company. And one of the key elements is being brand builders and people that can develop growth. We are a growth company, and we are a global company. And so obviously, being able to drive growth globally and being able to continue reshaping the cost structure of the company in the proper way that will become even more leverageable with future growth, are going to be essential characteristics. But I would just want to reassure you that the options that the Board has developed, they all have these characteristics. So as I said, the Board is pretty well advanced in the work needed to determine the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Bryan Spillane : Hi, thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone. So maybe just to kind of try to put this year, fiscal '25, into a little bit of a perspective, maybe Tracey, can you give us a sense of if China hadn't decelerated like it has since you last reported, what would earnings power have been this year? Or maybe to put it a different way, how much -- in terms of your forecast this year and the change in trend in China, like, how much do you think that actually affected earnings power in fiscal '25? Tracey Travis : Yeah. No, thanks, Bryan, for the question. So clearly, China and travel retail are important growth drivers for the company, have been historically and they're also high-margin areas of the company as well. So, when we see pressure in those areas as we saw in fiscal 2024, you can see what the impact on the company is. So if, right now, in our guidance, Mainland China is expected to be anywhere between flat to down high single-digits and travel retail Asia is expected to be down double-digit, that puts quite a bit of pressure on our earnings results and our EPS. The fact that this year, with those two pressures, we actually will have EPS up is really because of the contribution of the profit and recovery growth plan, the PRGP, which we will refer to it from now on, as we said in the prepared remarks. So that is delivering -- if you think about delivering around 51% at the low end of the range given the fact that we're relatively flat if you take the midpoint of our range in terms of our growth this year what we're expecting. So that means other markets like the Americas, APAC outside of China and EMEA outside of travel retail are expected to grow. But if you take that contribution, it is being offset by some expense deleverage. It's also in looking at your models, you need to add back some of the interest expense from our debt that we took out for the acquisition of TOM FORD in DECIEM and bonus as well back at target levels. So those are some of the differences. And then obviously, you heard our estimates for currency, which will be slightly dilutive for the year. So all of that puts pressure on our overall EPS. But still on a year that is close to what it was last year from a sales performance perspective, we are demonstrating improved margins and improved EPS. And that is because of -- and with a negative mix impact related to travel retail in China and that is because of both the PRGP as well as other actions the company has taken to really halt a lot of activities that we would normally do in the course of the year. We are also, importantly, as I said in our prepared remarks, protecting some investment for the momentum that we spoke about in the prepared remarks, in categories like fragrance, the active derm category and where we're seeing momentum. That will be important for us when we think forward to fiscal '26 and beyond and have more market growth, hopefully, but also those brands continuing to become a greater proportion of the business. Operator : And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m pausing, I had to frame my seven questions. So I wanted to just follow on, Tracey, maybe on the -- what you've just shared and the driver, the fact that there will be earnings growth even with sales flat to down. And you called out halting some activities, protecting some investment, noting all the expense deleverage that there will be, how should I -- why shouldn't I be concerned that there's going to be constraining investments this year because the market doesn't stand still, right? You mentioned North America more competitive. I'm going to guess other companies, whether they are global or local across China, are not going to be pulling back on investment. Everyone is going to want to be gaining share in a market that's down. So how do we know that there isn't too little investment being put back in '25 in the name of putting up some earnings growth? And then frankly, when we get to this time next year and there's new leadership in place or has been named and you have the strategic reset but there isn't another strategic reset. So I threw a lot in there, but those are the things that are in my mind that I'd love to hear both of you comment on. Thanks. Tracey Travis : No. Of course, Lauren. So, if you think about when we first described the PRGP, we said we have gross savings, and we are investing some of those gross savings in order to fund the program as well as fuel some of -- create fuel for some of our consumer-facing investments. And so when you think about the cadence of results and savings that we expect from the program, obviously, first quarter, there is some benefit, but that will progressively improve through the course of the year as our actions materialize. So, we are funding some of the consumer-facing investments out of the gross investments in our -- out of our PRGP. I also mentioned that even in fiscal '24, where we had green shoots, you heard, I mean, many of those strategies were put in place before, obviously, some of the innovation that we came out with and some of the plans that we had to expand in faster-growing channels. So we have tried to, in a very difficult year, even in fiscal '24, protect some of the consumer-facing investments. And as we see growth happening in certain areas, we will certainly fund more of it in some of the savings generated throughout the course of this year in the PRGP. Fabrizio Freda : And also, Lauren, I wanted to add a concept here, which is, my intention also announcing the retirement at the end of the fiscal year is also to work together with the Board, together with the team and when announced together with my successor on making sure that we put in 2025, the company in a condition to leverage growth momentum in general, in all the areas where the opportunity will be in the China market where today we see declines to continue to grow market share, and that's the focus. And in terms of the [PRT] (ph) to make sure that we have sufficient investments in all the key areas of the business where this momentum has to be preserved in the future. Those are internally key goals that we are going to pursue. And I hope that the strategic reset that I explained in my prepared remarks, somehow indicate also not only the numbers but the content on which we want to invest the numbers because it's clear that we have extraordinary strengths in our brands and brand equity and in our portfolio. It's clear that we continue to have great, high repeat rates because our products are outstanding [in light of] (ph) the consumer. I hope it's clear that our innovation is getting much stronger in many areas. And in clear that we have two big strategy reset areas. One is the lowering the exposure to declining market and declining channels and substitute this with high-growth market, high-growth channels, the best we can. And the second is actually improving the effectiveness of our marketing plan of our recruitment plans. And so we will get better support to our business, not only spending more money, but all what I said about precision marketing, is all about increasing the power of our recruitment. And finally, you heard me saying that our recruitment is being -- going to be focused more than ever on new consumers. And that, I believe, will make a big difference. And so all what I just said is really the purpose of the transition. And so the transition is going to be tailored to that. Operator : And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a few questions on the travel retail business, given we have a bit less visibility on the inventory levels. So can you -- it seems like the last two quarters, the industry decelerated in terms of sell-through, but you were up double-digit in terms of sell-in. Can you give us a sense of the inventory levels exiting the year? And Tracey, you mentioned you expect double-digit decline in fiscal '25. Can you give us any sense of the cadence of that decline? Is it more concentrated in the first half and then an improvement in the second half? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Tracey Travis : Sure. So you're right. As we said, and certainly, as you mentioned, others have said also there was a decline in Asia\u2019s travel retail, particularly in China travel retail in the last few months of our fiscal 2024, and that certainly did impact us. The reason we were up, we were anniversarying very low shipments from the prior year. And so we had in certain parts of China travel retail, specifically Hainan, very low shipments in our fourth quarter last year. And so even with decelerating sales, we were replenishing relative to what we had experienced in the prior year. But because of the acceleration from Q3 to Q4, the deceleration from Q3 to Q4, we did end with inventory levels higher than what we would have liked. And so part of what you see in our first quarter results is making sure that we keep inventory levels at the level that we and our customers want in that region even managing, obviously, the volatility from month-to-month that we and our retailers are experiencing. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. And I just want to add the perspective that this is actually a big priority for us, is really manage much better stock normalization in TR in the future. And so the -- what you said, which is obviously the retail in quarter four went down much more than expected. So by definition, created higher temporary stocks. We are already reacting in quarter one, readjusting it. That should be seen as a better activity and better management of this in the future. And as I said in previous calls, we are also preparing to build a distribution center in Hainan that will further shorten the time between orders in travel retail and delivery that will make this process better and better over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Group. Please go ahead with your question. Dana Telsey : Hi, good morning, everyone. As you think about the distribution channel shifts and the margin impacts, whether going on to Amazon specialty-multi, what does that mean for the business in terms of how you're seeing in North America, in particular, department stores and Amazon specialty-multi? And then with travel retail being 19% of sales, how do you see that in fiscal '25 and the progression as we move forward? Thank you. Tracey Travis : So, I'll start with the second one, Dana. Travel retail will be lower than it was in fiscal '24 because we're expecting it to be negative all year. So it will be a lower percent of our mix. And as Fabrizio mentioned, part of what obviously is happening is we're seeing channel shifts. We're seeing some of the travel retail business go to other regions whether it's remaining within mainland China or traveling to back to international travel in certain parts of the world, including, obviously, markets in addition to within the travel retail channel. So we expect that it will continue to shrink as a percent of our mix, at least in fiscal 2025 and hopefully see some stabilization after that. In terms of the faster growth channels that we are pivoting to, I mean, obviously they represent growth. Different channels had different margins. As you know, we don't give specific channel margin information. But to the extent that those channels are allowing us to recruit new consumers, it is certainly margin accretive for the company overall when we see the kind of reversal that we saw even in the last few months, launching on Amazon with Clinique. And so I think that's something that we are focused on. Fabrizio spoke about other platforms, online being a big focus for us as well from a strategic standpoint, platforms in other parts of the world that also represent growth and the recruitment of new consumers. So that is a big area of strategic pivot for us that we expect will be margin accretive for the company overall. Fabrizio Freda : And I\u2019d just want to add that as you have heard from our example today, a lot of these channel rebalancing is also between online and brick-and-mortar. And the online is very efficient for many reasons. On top of that, we\u2019ve used the last few years to develop online platforms that now we are in a condition to scale and to leverage in our activations of the various online channels. And finally, when you invest in a high-growth channel where the consumers are particularly active, particularly the young consumer, the return on the investment in advertising and the ability to recruit the right cost of recruitment actually increase while the cost of recruitment tends to be higher in declining channels. So the overall move for us will be actually positive in the long term. And we are managing this with the profitability mix in mind, one of the key things that we need to achieve. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Hope you are doing well. I was hoping to ask, maybe, a bigger picture question here, just given all the commentary in the release on the path forward and what has been slower progress in China and Asia travel retail. When you speak to category growth returning to mid-single-digits in fiscal '25, assuming China progressively recovered, what do you think is a realistic category growth expectation in China and maybe Asia travel retail as well as we look out longer term. Specifically, just trying to understand or be curious how you think about the ability to return to 6% to 8% organic sales growth if performance in these regions and channels doesn't necessarily return to growth rates we saw prior to the recent challenges? Thanks. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, I'll start and then Tracey will have to speak. I assume when you say category growth, you define the category as the prestige global market in total. That's what I understood for your question. And so the overall category growth of the luxury prestige part of the beauty business historically has been growing in the mid-single-digit range. And I think the factor today with China and travel retail Asia declining double digits in this moment in those markets, you see that we are forecasting 2%, 3%. And this forecasting 2%, 3% of the category growth is the reflection that we are not assuming in our guidance for fiscal year 2025, a stabilization of that. And basically, this is our attempt, try not to guess the future that is in this moment is very difficult to predict because of the volatility that Tracey spoke about. So with that context, you see immediately that the difference between stabilized Chinese consumers. So China stabilized and the market is [indiscernible] because the market with a stable growth in China was single digit -- sorry, was mid-single-digit. And so that's the difference between the 2% and the 5%. Now if in the future, we do expect the overall global category, as you define it, to benefit of the stabilization of the China TR consumption and market, and that will make the category stronger. So assuming the category will go back to a 5% global growth also because to be clear, except now the Chinese reset in this period, the demographic fundamentals, the reason of long-term development of this category are intact globally. In fact, you see still pretty strong development in Asia ex China, in Europe, in America, as we said before, despite a gradual reduction of the growth, the growth is still mid-single-digit and plus. So the market has strong fundamentals and the market will go back as it happened in the past. In the past, during, I don't know, the recession of 2008, 2009, the market went down in the 2% and then bounced back to the normal the year after. So we have seen this many other times in the history of the market. And we as a company believe that the strategy reset that we are discussing and the ability of our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan to put us back on track for leverage-ability will put all of us in a condition to grow at least 1 point ahead of the market in the long term and to reestablish our -- the way we think of long-term algorithm as growing ahead of the market. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So just going back to the commentary on North America market, you guys called out a strong competitive environment in the Americas. So just hoping to get more color on what you're seeing there? And as you look forward for your planning assumptions, are you expecting a further moderation in the US prestige market? Fabrizio Freda : So in our guidance, we are reflecting the current moderation of the growth because again, in this guidance, we are not guessing the future. We are reflecting what we see currently. And this moderation of the growth, however, brings the market still in the mid-single-digit growth. So it's not -- it\u2019s not a bad market. I mean, US has been weaker than that in the past. So it's still a relatively solid market growth that is happening today. And in this relatively solid market, we are working for dramatic improvements. I think it's important to understand that we have seen progress in quarter four. Because we grew retail even if the net was difficult, but we grew retail. And again, the net was reflecting also some issues happening in many of the retailers in our less fast-growing part of the business. But the retail was growing in July as we revealed the retail has further accelerated -- our retail has further accelerated. Some of our brands like Clinique is showing very exciting progress which is super encouraging. Actually, I would say that all the brands where we have started implementing a new strategy, we see that there is extraordinary interesting progress, which is validating that once we'll be able to implement across the portfolio, all the improvements that we are trying to do, we could achieve the stabilization, which is the first goal that we have in mind, the stabilization. So, stop the decline of market share, stabilize and align with the market growth in the US. So we are -- in summary, we are cautious of the overall market in the US in this moment, but we are positive on our progress in executing an improvement strategy in America. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Rainey Mancini, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead. Rainey Mancini : Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impact of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the investor section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our Brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. Throughout our discussion, our profit recovery and growth plan will be referred to as our PRGP. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio. Fabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. For the first quarter, we anticipated a challenging start to fiscal year 2025. Our results today are largely consistent with the outlook for the quarter we offered in August. Organic sales decreased 5% at the low end of the expected range, driven by double-digit declines in mainland China, global travel retail primarily owning to Asia, and Hong Kong SAR. Excluding these three areas, sales in the rest of our global business rose 1% both on a reported and organic basis, while retail sales growth accelerated sequentially from 2% to 3%. A number of markets continue to deliver organic sales growth in our first quarter, led by Japan, where we gained prestige beauty share. The developed markets in EMEA and our emerging markets also grew organically, while North America declined modestly as it compared to a big innovation launch calendar in the previous year. While we are not satisfied with our organic sales performance, we are encouraged by initial results from several pillars of our strategy reset that we announced in August, which I'll elaborate on in a few minutes. Despite a lower level of totally company-reported sales, adjusted gross margin expanded by over 300 basis points. Initiatives of the PRGP drove improvements, as Tracey Travis will describe. We strategically increased AAP spending as a percentage of sales in support of our robust innovation pipeline to realize over 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, despite significant operating leverage. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.14, better than $0.11 in the year-ago period, and $0.04 above the high end of our outlook range. Looking ahead, as the quarter evolved and through October, it became increasingly apparent that we are facing greater macro headwinds for fiscal year 2025 than we expected in August. First, the prestige beauty industry-reported retail sales in mainland China further weakened sequentially, from a 10% decline in our fourth quarter to a mid-teens percentage decrease. Importantly, we gained share in prestige beauty in mainland China for the second consecutive quarter, driven by industry-leading share gains in skincare and a return to share gains in makeup. Consumer sentiment in mainland China weakened further in our first quarter. While we believe the new economic stimulus measures present medium-to-long-term potential for stabilization and then, ultimately growth in prestige beauty, we anticipate still strong declines near-term for the industry. Second, the prestige beauty industry in Asia travel retail continues to be significantly pressured, as commercial levels are still far lower than pre-pandemic. Third, the U.S. prestige beauty industry retail sales slowed sequentially, from high single-digit growth in our fourth quarter to mid-single-digit growth, as elevated levels of inflation-driven pricing fades. While this is still good growth, the months of August and September possess lower growth than July. Encouragingly, although the U.S. prestige beauty industry's retail sales growth decelerated sequentially, our company's retail sales growth accelerated. And we further reduced our prestige beauty share loss. We believe we are well on our way to stabilize the shares in the U.S. as we increase our exposure to high growth channels, and we have our sights set on a return to prestige beauty share growth. With this complex industry landscape, including the particularly difficult difficulty in forecasting the timing of market stabilization and recovery in China and Asia travel retail, and in the context of the retirements of Tracey and myself, we are solely issuing an outlook for the second quarter and withdrawing our fiscal year 2025 outlook. Additionally, we are reducing our dividends to a more appropriate payout ratio, which will also create more financial flexibility for our incoming leadership team to re-accelerate our profitable growth trajectory. Our second quarter outlook reflects the extensive headwinds at retail in China and Asia travel retail, as we do not expect to see benefit from the stimulus in the near term. We intend to continue investing behind our strategic reset, especially in support of our rich innovation pipeline and expanded consumer reach. Our strategic reset at this point in time is focused on continuing to rebalance our regional growth evolving our exposure to China market volatility, which has already come down by nearly 10 percentage points since fiscal year 2022. At the strategic reset, core is the PRGP aimed at restoring sustainable long-term organic sales growth. In part through generating reinvestment opportunities as well as rebuilding profitability and increasing agility. For fiscal year 2025, we are focused on executing the PRGP with excellence. During the first quarter, the focus and dedication of our teams around the world enabled us to establish a strong foundation on delivery for the plan. We have made good progress in operationalizing the PRGP evident in our gross margin expansion despite the pressure to mix from skin care decline as well as beginning to rightsize areas of our organization and address over expenses to reflect the lower-than-expected sales growth in the last two fiscal years. As you know, our strategic reset for fiscal year 2025 also has the following five priorities : Bring it skin care, capitalize on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrance, move faster in leveraging winning channels, launch accretive innovation, inclusive of new big opportunities, a modernized precision marketing by leveraging data and AI, the latter of which we call our consumer-centric growth model. Today, let me share our progress across skin care, fragrance as well as leveraging winning channels. For skin care, we began to realize our ambitions to drive consumer demand in the ritual of nighttime skin care as we brought exciting innovation to market, appealing to a diverse range of consumer segments. Our Estee Lauder brand has long been a leader in the science of skin recovery with its advanced serum. Its new advanced new repair overnight treatment drove expanded regiments by both loyalists and new consumers. This launch, coupled with a brand-new moisturizer in the supreme franchise focus on improving signs of collagen loss with overnight visible line reductions led to high single-digit organic sales growth in skin care in the markets of EMEA. La Mer further contributed to our momentum in nighttime skin care. Its new rejuvenated night cream exceeded our expectation in Asia Pacific, driven by the product resounding appeal in China, where we saw excellent new consumer acquisition trend and La Mer realized strong share gains in prestige skin care. For Clinique, among its nighttime innovation is the Smart Clinical repair AM, PM retinoid-balanced stick. It has been very well received in its initial markets, demonstrating an ability with nighttime skin here to trade consumer app and into the brand with an approachable price point and unique for. Both this brand and the franchise new overnight recovery cream plus mask have compelling green stories and strong clinical results, which Clinique scientists recently featured in the prestigious dermatology conference in Amsterdam. Indeed, Clinique focus on nighttime skin care builds upon the strategy it become deployed earlier this calendar year to double down on its authentic dermatologists brand heritage. This strategy has been highly successful, evidenced by the Clinique fifth consecutive month of prestige beauty share gains in the U.S. through September. Turning to fragrance. Our confidence in the category's promising growth opportunity remains strong. For the first quarter, our fiscal year 2025, excluding global travel retail, our luxury and artisanal brands delivered mid-single-digit organic sales growth, fueled by gains in every region. Le Labo, Jo Malone and Kilian Paris were standouts from Le Labo, significant double-digit growth in China to Jo Malone London impressive results, expanding with the male consumer to Chilean Paris highly sort innovation. And we are thrilled to have launched Valmont Beauty during the first quarter, beginning with a sophisticated collection of eight fragrances, four of which a Belmont's legacy sense reinvented for the modern era. As we enter fragrance highly important holiday gifting season, we are complementing the strength of our luxury and our seasonal portfolio with activations and innovations from Estee Lauder and Clinique to reaccelerate their growth as we aim to better capitalize on opportunities in the prestige tier brands. Let me now move to our pillar of leveraging winning channels. From the Amazon Premium Beauty store in the U.S. to TikTok shop to in Southeast Asia, many of our brands expanded their reach to attract new consumers. Alongside these launches, we also strategically expanded the freestanding store footprint of our luxury and artisanal fragrance portfolio, offering elevated experiential shopping. This exciting work continued into the second quarter when last week, our flagship Estee Lauder brand launched in the U.S. Amazon Premium Beauty store. Before I close, I want to highlight, we recently published our fiscal year 2024 social impact and sustainability report. As detailed in the report, we achieved several sustainability goals, some ahead of schedule, including surpassing our water withdrawal targets, publishing our first corporate ingredient glossary and reaching our palm oil objectives before our 2025 deadline. For the fifth year in a row, we achieved carbon neutrality across our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and sourced 100% renewable electricity globally for our direct operations. Along with the report, we also published an update to our climate transition plan, which describes our recent progresses and evolution towards our 2030 science-based targets across our climate actions work streams. Let me now close by recognizing the evolution of the company leadership following the retirement announcement of Tracey and myself. As you know, tomorrow Akhil Shrivastava becomes the company's CFO. Akhil has been a proven leader at the company for nearly a decade with demonstrated financial acumen and we look forward to what he will accomplish. On behalf of the company, I extend our deepest gratitude to Tracey for her significant contributions. Tracey embodies the very best qualities of a leader and we are a far stronger organization today given her dedication to all of us. We wish her every joy in her well-earned retirement. Yesterday, marked an exciting milestone in our company with 75 years of history as we announced the promotion of Stephane de La Faverie to be our next President and CEO. I'm thrilled to welcome him into his role as of January 1 and look forward to supporting a seamless transition for the next several months. Stephane\u2019s deep knowledge of our company and the industry, exceptional strength as a leader and unique ability to combine inspiration, authenticity and strategic insights to drive profitable growth will enable him to move us forward with speed and agility. To our employees, thank you for your passion for our company and its incredible brands. I'm confident that you and this company that I love will be in great hands. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Tracey Travis : Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our financial results for the first quarter, followed by the outlook that we are prepared to share today. As Fabrizio mentioned, our first quarter organic net sales declined 5% at the lower end of our expectations. Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.14, which exceeded our initial outlook for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses. Starting with our regions. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region decreased 11% mainly driven by further softening in overall prestige beauty due in large part to our consumer sentiment in Mainland China. In addition, we experienced a net sales decline in Hong Kong SAR, where sales were pressured by lower spending from traveling consumers as well as reduced foot traffic at retail. These lines were partially offset by continued strength in Japan, where domestic and traveling consumers drove double-digit growth in both brick-and-mortar and online channels. Organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region decreased 4%, driven largely by the ongoing challenges in our Asia travel retail business. Our global travel retail net sales decreased double digits due to lower replenishment orders in Asia travel retail. This reflected the further retail market deceleration and worsened consumer sentiment in China, resulting in lower conversion rates. Consequently, while we managed to reduce our overall initial -- overall inventory levels in the trade, it was a slower pace than we initially expected. Elsewhere in EMEA, net sales grew low single digits, benefiting from commercial activations like Estee Lauder's #NightDoneRight campaign as well as both existing products and new product launches, including the Clinique caplet franchise. Luxury fragrances was also strong, led by Le Labo. Retailer and pure-play sites drove overall double-digit growth from online channels. Organic net sales in the Americas decreased 1%. In North America, our retail sales in the U.S. accelerated sequentially. However, our soft retail sales from M A C, TOM FORD and Too Faced led to overall lower net sales, reflecting fewer replenishment orders for these brands. A strong competitive environment and the continued moderation of growth in prestige beauty in the U.S. also contributed to the net sales decline. Our team remains focused on evolving our channel distribution mix towards fast-growing channels with the consumer as evidenced by the launch of seven brands in the last eight months in Amazon's U.S. premium beauty store, including our most recent launch of Estee Lauder, as Fabrizio mentioned. This strategic pivot drove our double-digit online growth in the U.S. In Latin America, continued net sales growth in Brazil, led by makeup drove double-digit increases in our freestanding stores and specialty multichannels. From a category standpoint, organic net sales declined 8% in skin care and 6% in hair care. In skin care, the organic net sales decline was largely due to the pressures in Asia Pacific and in our Asia travel retail business, which more than offset the growth we experienced. In the Americas and the markets of EMEA, including from Estee Lauder with its successful night activations in West and shipment for the products launch in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store. Organic net sales in makeup decreased 2%, driven by declines from M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Too Faced primarily reflecting the brand's retail softness in North America. These declines were partially offset by standout performance from Clinique, which saw strong overall double-digit net sales growth, driven by contributions from all regions. The brand's existing products and new innovation in its Clinique Pop and almost lipstick product franchises, along with its launch in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty Store in fiscal 2024 primarily drove the brand's growth in the quarter. Organic net sales in fragrance decreased 1%, mainly due to declines from TOM FORD, Clinique and Estee Lauder, driven by pressures in both our Asia travel retail business in North America. These decreases were partially offset by growth from the rest of our luxury fragrances, particularly in the Asia Pacific region and the markets of EMEA driven by products, new innovation and targeted expanded consumer reach. Our gross margin expanded 310 basis points compared to last year, largely due to a reduction in obsolescence charges as we better aligned our inventory on hand with our shipments throughout last year. We also better capitalized on our strategic pricing initiatives by reducing discounts related to excess production and promotions, while leveraging our pricing power ahead of inflation through an enhanced more granular pricing methodology. This was partially offset by the unfavorable change in mix, particularly the decline in skin care and the corresponding fixed deleverage. Our gross margin for the quarter also improved 90 basis points sequentially versus our fourth quarter. With this progress, we are pleased that key initiatives under the PRGP are beginning to address the specific pressures to gross margin that we experienced over the past two years, including the sales pressure we continue to experience in the quarter. We obviously still have much more to do, and the company remains focused on controlling excess and obsolescence through our integrated business planning process to better align our forecast accuracy and demand planning as well as addressing other cost opportunities in the supply chain. Operating expenses increased 190 basis points as a percent of sales during the quarter primarily driven by selling expense deleverage and advertising to support new product launches. This deleverage offset the net benefits and expenses realized under the PRGP in the quarter. As I mentioned in August, most of the PRGP's estimated net benefits this year are expected to be realized in improving our gross profit margin with approximately 20% of the benefits realized in reducing certain operating expenses. We expect to achieve greater net benefits and operating expenses for the remainder of the year from the plan as initiatives are further operationalized and as benefits from our restructuring program progress. Operating income increased 33% to $144 million, and our operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 4.3% compared to 3.1% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.8% compared to 17.9% last year. The increase is mainly due to the lower tax base in the prior year, which included the utilization of income tax credits and benefits from previously issued stock-based compensation. Diluted EPS was $0.14 compared to $0.11 last year due to the improving operating profit performance. Our plans under our previously communicated PRGP are on track and advancing well. We also continue to explore additional savings initiatives to offset some of the impacts from the incremental sales pressure we are experiencing globally as well as mitigate the impact of reduced volume on certain initiatives within the PRGP. As it relates to our restructuring program, to date, we have taken $221 million of charges primarily related to initiatives designed to optimize and rightsize our value chain by reducing spans and layers. Additionally, we intend to expand our shared services capabilities to streamline and standardize key processes that should enable us to better leverage our sales growth as it occurs. During the quarter, we utilized $670 million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $408 million last year. The increase in net cash utilization is mainly due to lower net earnings compared to last year and higher taxes paid. In addition, from late August through October of this year, we entered into agreements with certain plaintiff law firms to settle approximately 70% of pending talcum powder cases and established annual capped amounts with each participating law firm for potential future claims over the next five years, starting on January 1, 2025. As a result, we recorded a charge of $159 million related to these agreements. We entered into these agreements in response to the rising number of cases brought against the company as well as to proactively help to mitigate the future risk from the evolving litigation landscape related to talc. We invested $141 million in capital expenditures and we returned $240 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. As you read in our press release this morning, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, a reduction from our previous quarterly dividend of $0.66 per share as we reduce our dividend to a more appropriate payout ratio given our earnings outlook. And now turning to our outlook. As Fabrizio mentioned, we have taken the decision to withdraw the full year outlook we provided in August and are only providing an outlook for the near-term second quarter today. We have not made this decision lightly and believe it is the right action given the current environment, including the difficulty in forecasting the timing of market stabilization and recovery in China and Asia travel retail and in the context of upcoming leadership changes. Let me expand a bit on some of these incremental pressures on the business. First, as we discussed in August, our initial outlook anticipated pressures in both Mainland China and Asia travel retail, expecting these changes to significantly impact our first quarter results, but moderate sequentially throughout the year, including a modest return to net sales growth in the second quarter. While our first quarter results are generally aligned with those expectations, the worsening consumer sentiment in these areas has been greater than anticipated and is also now expected to persist in the near term. Although we are cautiously optimistic about the potential medium to long-term opportunities presented by the new economic stimulus measures in China, we believe both the timing and the magnitude of their impact on our business in the region are uncertain. As a result, we now anticipate continued near-term net sales declines in these areas of our business and overall for the second quarter, adding pressure to our EPS. Second, the continued normalization of prestige beauty growth in other markets post pandemic, along with near-term residual impacts of the previous inflationary period on consumer sentiment has created some uncertainty about the level at which market stabilization will occur and is expected to further pressure our second quarter results. As mentioned earlier, we remain focused on realizing net benefits from our PRGP initiatives, given the anticipated incremental sales pressure we acknowledge the need to continuously evaluate the plan and more importantly, take decisive action to maximize its benefits, identify new opportunities for growth and pursue additional savings initiatives. Using October 24 spot rates of $1.078 for the euro $1.293 for the pound, $7.126 for the Chinese yuan and $1.380 for the Korean won currency translation is not expected to have a material impact to reported sales and EPS for the second quarter. We now expect organic net sales for our second quarter to decrease 6% to 8% compared to the prior year period, largely due to the ongoing challenges in Mainland China and in Asia Travel Retail. We have discussed as well as persistent low conversion rates by trailing consumers in Hong Kong SAR. In terms of gross margin, we expect expansion in the second quarter compared to last year. Although it is not expected to be at the same magnitude as the level of expansion we saw in the first quarter. Recall that last year's first quarter gross margin was the lowest of the fiscal year as it was more affected by high obsolescence charges, and discounts than in the other three quarters. And it did not reflect the benefits of the strategic actions we implemented later in the year to address these pressures and improve gross margin. We now expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 43% compared to 37.7% last year. The increase primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of previously issued stock-based compensation, which tends to have a disproportionate effect in the second quarter due to the timing of equity award vesting and our estimate of lower earnings compared to last year. We now expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.20 to $0.35 for a decrease between 60% to 77% versus prior year. This has undoubtedly been a challenging period for our teams and all of us to manage through. However, as Fabrizio mentioned, we are encouraged by some bright spots that we are starting to see from proactive measures we have taken previously. There is clearly more to be done, and we have confidence in our teams, including our new leadership team to continue to drive progress forward. As I close this earnings call, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our dedicated employees. Your steadfast commitment, hard work, incredible passion for our brands and resilience have been vital to our success over these years and certainly will be in the future. And reflecting on my past 12-plus years with the company, I am immensely proud of the many things that we have accomplished together. To our valued investors, thank you for your continued support. Your patience and confidence in our long-term growth strategy and initial PRGP actions have been instrumental as we navigate through this intense period of volatility and the resulting impact it has had on our performance. I am optimistic in the company's ability to continue to take the appropriate decisive actions to manage through this prolonged period of volatility and supported by the PRGP and the strong result of our employees to progressively return to more consistent and sustainable sales growth and stronger profitable recovery. Thank you, and that concludes our prepared remarks. So we'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So clearly, the external circumstances have worsened in the beauty category, particularly in China and Asia Travel Retail, as you mentioned. Just wanted to get your perspective on the internal reaction to that. A, just from a productivity standpoint, is there more you can do beyond the PRPG program. Tracey, you alluded to that in your prepared remarks, but just the significant pressure on the business and the dividend cut today, can you give us a bit more detail on how much more aggressive you can get on cost structure, the potential areas you're looking at? And then, b, just the other side of that, is how much reinvestment might be needed going forward to drive a top line recovery. So any thoughts there in light of the industry conditions at this point would be helpful. Thanks. Tracey Travis : Sure, Dara. So obviously, given the situation, and I discussed this a little bit in the prepared remarks, we are evaluating additional actions related to the PRGP and beyond, given the continued pressure on the business. So we have identified some additional cost savings to offset some of the volume pressure that we saw in the first quarter. There are more plans under discussion as it relates to the PRGP. As it relates to investment, we did protect some investment in the first quarter. We actually did experience a bit of deleverage in more of our consumer-facing areas like marketing, advertising and promotion as well as selling. We will do that again in the second quarter. So that is some of what is embedded in the guidance. And obviously, Stephane and Akhil will be communicating going forward what the plans are that are in process right now being worked on in terms of the new actions that might be incorporated under the PRGP as well as other growth areas as well. But we are very much focused as we have communicated previously. Under the PRGP to free up costs, obviously not only to improve our margin, but importantly, to fuel additional growth for our brands and more to come on that. Fabrizio Freda : And I want just to add that on the reinvestment on top of the amount of funds that we need to reinvest is the improvement of the quality of this investment and on the return on these investments where we are doing as part of the PRGP a lot of work. And this means, for example, what we call the strategy of increasing our precision marketing and our consumer-focused marketing, which is basically the recognition of the improvements we need to do in the digital social media part, in the way we go to market in every market of the world in this area. And there are some exciting progress happening as demonstrated by some results in the market share that some new innovation created while using this precision marketing techniques. And then is the -- also the winning -- the acceleration of winning fast in growing channels is obviously a big part of that. Because when you are present in the growing winning channels with our brands faster and with more services and clarity, like we are doing, as I explained in my prepared remarks in many markets. This makes the return on the investment that we are doing better and more productive. So it's a combination of investing more as Tracey explained and making every dollar count more. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Powers : Thank you very much. And good morning. I was hoping we could step back a little bit, just amidst all this volatility, you get some perspective on how you see your market share standing across key markets, your expectations for how those market shares should trend into 2Q and over the balance of the fiscal year? And to the extent possible, how you see different regions contributing to the negative 6% to negative 8% organic growth call for second quarter? That would be helpful. Thank you very much. Tracey Travis : Yeah. So in terms of the regions, and Steve, you know we normally don't give regional guidance, just our overall guidance. But obviously, with down 6% to down 8%, we would expect as we said, continued pressure from China and travel retail. We've also seen, and I think Fabrizio will touch on this point on the market share. We have seen slowing in other markets as well. So when you think about last year first quarter, we had double digit growth in several markets in North America and APAC. And we've seen that progressively decelerate, still positive. And I'm talking market now, but progressively decelerate throughout the four quarters. So part of the uncertainty is whether or not those markets will decelerate again in the second quarter. But we are expecting that China and Travel Retail will be down meaningfully in the second quarter as they were in the first quarter. And the rest of the business, which Fabrizio talked about what the results were in the first quarter being a bit of a pickup in the second quarter, but resulting obviously in the Q2 guidance that we gave. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah. And in market share, I mean, maybe I should -- we can speak about the market share plans in every single region of the world. But let me focus on what will make a big difference with China, U.S., Japan, so the big markets. And so in China, I think this quarter, in a declining market, we had proved that when we focus on the strategy that we just discussed, meaning focusing on skin care in the case of China, the night skin care, focusing on winning in the growing channels, focusing on improving our precision marketing and focusing on leveraging very strong innovation. We can get market share growth in a very difficult market situation. In China, the growth we got in skin care, which is more than one full point of market share growth in skin care is very, very strong. And this is driven by this innovation, for example, the La Mer brand and their own innovation. We grew also market share in makeup, where the activity, for example, was less than in skin care, our activity was less than in skin care. We still grew market share. This shows at least the clear strengths of our brand equities that when activated correctly via market share growth. So in China, we are optimistic on the opportunity in the future. Japan was another great example where we focused particularly in the case of Japan on our fragrance portfolio in the new Le Labo store and with the new Jo Malone stores in Tokyo that are flagship stores and the result has been an extraordinary, frankly, 200 points of market share gain in fragrance, becoming the number one fragrance company in Japan in only one quarter. Again, shows that the focus, when we put the focus on the activation of these strategy drivers we get extraordinary results. So those are, frankly, green points that shows how the underlying brand equity is strong and when activated correctly, we get what we need to get. And finally, on America, I want to say that is our retail trends in America was strong, was accelerated from 2% in the quarter to 3% this quarter, so improving and improving in a declining market growth, as Tracey Travis just explained. So the market growth went from 9% to 5%. So still growth but declining level of growth we were growing better and accelerating that, which means practically in America, we are reducing the market share growth. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we look forward to a stabilization. And the tactics which are working here, and again, very visible in what is the reaction of our Clinique brand, which is obviously a classic brand, a brand which is there for many years, is the market leader in skin care in the market and is growing now market share for five months in a row driven by the big repositioning and leveraging the trends in their mask skin care, particularly, but also leveraging the huge success in makeup in this moment, as we explained in the prepared remarks. And also it's been led obviously by the Amazon distribution. I want to notice that at the same time, the success of Clinique in Ulta has been very, very strong, showing that the Amazon is bringing new customers is not just speaking to the same customer. It's adding market share, adding new customers and along all our new channels partners like Amazon or historical strong partners like Ulta to get success on the same brands. And this is happening also fragrances in many other activities we have in the market. So we are focused on continued accelerating market share gains in markets like China and Japan and focus on achieving further stabilization and then a gain market share also in the U.S. And there are many other markets of the world, emerging markets or specific markets where when we look at the last 12 months, we did progress market share. And we will continue to accelerate together with -- the answer that Tracey and I gave to the previous question, which is the increased investment and increased precision of these investments. I hope you see the full picture of what we are trying to do even in a moment where the bottom of the market, but in China and Travel Retail are dropping under us, we are keeping the focus on this recovery of market share in every single market. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks, good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a bit about the dividend cut, both in terms of timing and kind of the message. So first, just in terms of timing, why not clean this up back in office? I know that China worsened during the quarter. But I would argue it's not to the degree that dividend should have come into question. And then the second thing is just on the message. Should we be thinking here about it because of time line and magnitude of earnings recovery when we think out over the next several years, should we be thinking about cash and reinvestment needs because there's hardly a leverage problem, there's not a balance sheet problem, but this is a pretty big change. So timing and sort of the message and how we should be thinking through this beyond there just being room for new leadership? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Yeah. Thanks, Lauren, for the question. Look, reducing our dividend is not an indication at all of what we think about our long-term growth opportunities. Given the pressures, not only in the first quarter, which, to your point, we expected, but in the second quarter, which is a difference, obviously, than where we were in August. As we looked at recognizing the level of uncertainty that we are experiencing for the balance of the year, which caused us to pull our guidance. We thought it appropriate at this time as well to look at the dividend. When you think about paying $0.66 dividend with the earnings, the $0.14 that we had in the quarter. And obviously, what we guided for the second quarter, it was appropriate for us to rightsize the dividend at this time to make sure. Obviously, we don't have a liquidity problem to your point, but recognizing the prolonged situation in terms of pressure in our markets, rightsizing the dividend still a very good dividend yield for investors. But rightsizing it was the appropriate thing to do to protect the cash that will be needed, obviously, for additional actions that we may take under the PRGP as well as additional investments we may make to support growth. So really looking at it into totality in terms of total shareholder return and figuring out what's the best way for us to invest back in the business as well as obviously continue to return a nice yield in terms of dividend to our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Bryan Spillane : Thanks operator. Good morning, Tracey. Good morning, Fabrizio. I guess, my question is more related to the management change and the qualities and skill sets that both you and Tracey were looking for in terms of replacements. And I asked that in the context of you both have been around this company as it was effectively turned around and brought it to a very amazing peak. And the landscape's changed a little bit for sure. Maybe that understates it. And so just I think people are trying to understand what comes next and not asking about the people specifically, but just the qualities, the skill sets you were looking for? And I guess how it informs like what you think needs to be different, right, as the company kind of charter through these next few years relative to maybe what you all brought to the party over the last 10-plus years. Fabrizio Freda : Yeah, first of all, the -- let me say, first of all, what has to be different in the business. As you know, we have announced what we believe is the strategy reset. And we are working hard to rebalance the growth model of the company and avoiding in the future overexposures to areas of the global world that becoming too volatile and more uncertain. And so the rebalancing for the certainty of growth. Just to make an example of this because these actually in many areas. This concept of balance growth better exposing to the company, to the growth trends of the world is referred to countries, but it's also referred to channels, referred to consumer segments in a very broad way. And obviously, in this moment is referred to the overall Asia Travel Retail and overall China market volatility, where we have rebalanced 10 points in only two years already. And this year, more rebalance will happen. And then this refer to channels where the proportion, for example, of global department stores versus the other channels, which in this moment are growing faster, is changing in favor of the winning channels and et cetera. So all this work, by the way, on consumer is, obviously, the penetration of young consumers to mention one. So all these important strategic rebalancing elements is something that we believe we need to continue to do. And we need leadership that has the characteristic that can really look at the business in this way. And so a big understanding of the global market dynamics and understanding on the global consumers and continuing the work that we have started of focusing the company on the consumers and on the big consumer changes that are happening around the world leadership that will focus on with a good understanding of the global business and being able to leverage global growth wherever growth happen. And also, we are a company of brands. And it's very important that our leadership team continue to be an outstanding brand builder and been able to build brand equities, but also innovation and the quality of the brand of responding to different targets around the world and the ability of brands to adapt to the various market consumer segments around the world with the concept that we called in the past, local relevance that is becoming even more important. For example, the actions that correspond to this intention are building in China research centers in Shanghai or in building factories in Asia that will bring talents to our portfolio in the future. So those are -- the part of the strategy needs to be continued. And there is then the need of accelerating these strategies. And there is the need also as told as part of the PRGP to make the organization faster in reacting to trends but also faster in making decisions across the globe and aligning on the changes that are needed to react, so what we call the increase of speed and increase of agility, which are just two words, but behind us two words, there's a lot of specific changes that new leadership will intend to bring in the organization is already frankly working on it and need to be capable of doing this. That's why I'm personally very happy that the board, at the end selected internal succession because the internal succession in that area of the ability to bring this organization fast to important changes with the right speed and also the ability to understand what has to be changed in order to increase agility, frankly, visibility is stronger in very talented internal leaders that would be external. But again, that's my point of view. And then the understanding of how to better allocate our resources to the big changing trends of the world is also a characteristic that the new leadership needs to have and that is supported by -- so the quality, obviously, of what the board chose for future leadership, but also by the knowledge of these people about the internal systems and where we are. So net, we believe we need brand builders, but we need also people that will act with urgency, speed, courage to make the needed changes. I will support this courage -- this change in my transition work with the team. And we are looking forward to -- for the new team to add a fast impact in what has to change, but also for the new thing to recognize the strength that you mentioned in your question, there was -- there are the strengths, not only the Tracey and I build in the last many years together in the company, but also the strength has always been in this company, the values of this company, the long-term quality of the brands and the strength the part of the heritage of this company. So these historical strengths will be retained, but there will be some fast change in reacting to the new realities. And I personally believe that the new leadership team will be able to bring the kind of improvements and acceleration that, obviously, all of you are expecting from us in the next years. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go to the cash flow statement. So I just want to get a sense of if there's opportunities to further reduce CapEx to better align with the weaker earnings part of the business currently? And then I just wanted to also get your thoughts on the health of inventory as you see it to that? Tracey Travis : Yeah. So -- and I'll start with CapEx. We have already reduced CapEx from what we had initially expected to invest this year. And that is certainly one of the areas that we're looking on as it relates to cash, along with obviously, improvements in working capital. We made some big improvements last year as it relates to inventory. So our inventories are in pretty good shape. But obviously, given the further sales declines, that is something that we are very much focused on in terms of making sure we are faster to react and respond to sales declines in our markets. And keeping the obsolescence in discounting under tighter control. So we've gotten much more agility in our planning processes and the connection with certainly our supply chain to make sure that we're making the right -- taking the right decisions as it relates to production as well as the overall management of the network. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Bonnie Herzog : Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I actually wanted to circle back to Asia Travel Retail with a question. You mentioned the lower replenishment orders. So could you give us a sense of maybe where retail inventory levels are currently maybe versus a year ago? And how much further destocking you expect, I guess, ultimately, how do you sell-in, sellout trends to evolve throughout the balance of the year? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Yeah. So we definitely have lower levels of inventory in the trade relative to last year and even last quarter. So we have made progress. As I said in the prepared remarks, as it relates to bringing down the inventory and trade in Asia Travel Retail. Because of deceleration of the market, we didn't make as much progress as we had expected. So it is taking a little bit longer. But again, we're not giving guidance for the second half of the year, but we do expect even in Q2 to be able to make -- assuming no more significant change than what we've reflected in our Q2 guidance. Some more progress in terms of inventory in the trade. Right now, it's really a function of the market volatility. Some of the trade that had built up or the inventory that had built up during the pandemic years, we have managed that down. And now it's a matter of the current market fluctuations that's impacting the levels of inventory that we have in the trade, but we're in a much healthier place than we were certainly a year ago, given the significant actions that we took, particularly in the first half of the year to bring our inventory levels down. Fabrizio Freda : And to give a dimensionalization just to add what Tracey saying, is we actually have the level in the last several years, but the market is lower than it was in the previous year. So that we should need to continue doing some work. But definitely, there's been extraordinary progress, and I would like everyone to know that the team is very focused in this progress and also our vision of quarter to reflect the need to continue this never let pass more than a few months when we decided to reflect the market trend also in the level of inventories. Bonnie Herzog : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask more about the Q2 outlook, more so for profit than sales and whether you could talk about what's embedded from a deleveraging aspect versus maintaining investment versus perhaps more difficulty in achieving savings as part of the PRGP. Effectively, just helping us bridge from sales to EPS, is it like a much bigger sequential dollar increase than in the years past and up pretty considerably on a year-over-year basis as well. So essentially, what's driving costs up so much in Q2 to help us assess what that pressure looks like in the second half of the year when you're not giving us additional color? Thank you. Tracey Travis : Okay. So I'll give it a shot, Olivia. So I would start with gross margin. We expect that gross margin will continue to improve in the second quarter. As I said in the prepared remarks, not as much year-over-year as in the first quarter. But from first quarter to second quarter, we will expect -- we do expect even on declined sales, a further improvement in gross margin. On a 6% to 8% decline in sales and that being in China and Travel Retail and Travel Retail, in particular, that does put pressure on our expense base. We have talked in the past about both China and Travel Retail being quite profitable areas for us given the productivity per door in that region. And so that is putting some additional pressure on our expense base, but we also are protecting some investments very selectively in areas of the business that are working. And so it's a big quarter for us, obviously, with holiday. We do have some new innovative advertising that we are doing behind some of our faster growth areas in order to make sure that we do set up the business to have the best holiday possible in light of the declining sales and 11/11 as well as, obviously, going forward into the second half of the year. So advertising is one area that is continuing to deleverage, selling as well, making sure that we have the right staff in our channels of brick-and-mortar distribution in order to execute the sales. And then the other area that we've protected strategically this year and continue to do so, obviously, rationalizing that as we see performance come through is store investments. And so we have brands like Le Labo and Jo Malone, who are freestanding store brands in addition to other channels of distribution. But doing quite well and growing, and we are investing in their store base as well. And so those are the areas predominantly that we are protecting from an investment standpoint. And it relates to the PRGP, what we had had previously, and again, I'll reiterate it, is we expected the first half of this year and really much of this year to see PRGP benefits in our gross margin, which we're obviously seeing and more benefits starting in the second half of the year as it relates to some of the restructuring activities that we are taking under the program. And so the cadence of when to actually see some of those expenses reflected, obviously, being offset with some of the sales declines in the first half of the year would be in the second half of the year. But again, be mindful that the -- when you have mid-single-digit declines in your business, it does create deleverage on the rest of the business that is -- the PRGP is helping, but it's still deleveraging. Fabrizio Freda : And the only thing I want to add, again for perspective to what Tracey explained, is the fact that there is a mix factor because where the markets decline. The majority of the change we are proposing is as we explained China market and Travel Retail Asia market. These are two markets where we have big market shares and with big market share can scale and we scale and profitability. So those are important profitable markets with us where the decline is happening. And this important decline of markets where we have scale, market share and profitability, obviously, it's more painful in terms of mix impact on a single quarter by quarter two that if the decline was more average around the world, which is not, in this case, is very focused on those two issues. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we've reached the end of the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
