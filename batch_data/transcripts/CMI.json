Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter 1 2014 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Juliann, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, sir. Carl D. Anderson: Thank you, Juliann. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's first quarter 2014 earnings call. On the call today, we have Ike Evans, Meritor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Today's presentation will be abbreviated due to our scheduled analyst event in New York on Thursday, February 6. We're looking forward to providing you with more detail at that time. Now I'll turn the call over to Ike. Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Carl, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 3 for some highlights from our first fiscal quarter of this year. As you can see, performance improvement initiatives are continuing to drive financial results. We generated $12 million of adjusted net income, or $0.12 per share, in the quarter from continuing operations. Year-over-year, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 250 basis points and had the best first quarter free cash flow performance in 4 years. We believe these results are particularly meaningful concerning the significant step down in our defense business from the same quarter last year. We told you during our fourth quarter call that we expected the action taken in the past year to drive continued margin expansion this year even though we did not anticipate revenue growth. Our performance this quarter demonstrates that these actions are having the intended results. We continue to execute our M2016 strategy, and I tell you I am really pleased with the progress we're making. We certainly have more work ahead of us, but first quarter results are consistent with our plan, and we're really off to a good start this year. We're also reaffirming our fiscal year guidance. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a look at our sequential performance. Typically, we see our revenue decline in the first quarter due to seasonality from less selling days and production impacts from the holiday season. This year, however, revenue in the first quarter decreased only $2 million from the fourth quarter of last year to $907 million. Prebuy activity in Europe and slightly stronger production in China mitigated the anticipated impact of less aftermarket sales in North America and lower truck production in South America. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million in the first quarter, flat to the prior year, while adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.7% for the quarter. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $12 million, up $1 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.12, up $0.01 from the fourth quarter of last year. Total free cash flow was negative $16 million, an improvement of $30 million from the prior quarter. Keep in mind, we prefunded $54 million of required 2014 pension contributions in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding this prefunding, free cash flow decreased in our fiscal first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Cash flow performance in our first fiscal quarter is typically weaker due to the normal seasonality in our business. Please turn to Slide 5. We're encouraged with the recent developments in our defense business. With respect to our HMMWV Recap opportunity, the Marine Corps recently selected a vehicle configuration for this program. This important decision followed a competitive evaluation process of 4 different configurations. It was determined during this process that Meritor's content meets or exceeds the Marine's performance specifications. Specifically, our content includes ProTec suspension, differentials, brakes, wheel end equipment, frame rails, drivelines, drivetrain control and central tire inflation systems. To give you an idea of the total Marine Corps program value, the selling price of each vehicle is expected to be $110,000. At more than 6,800 units, the program value is in excess of $750 million over the course of 5 years. With significant content on each vehicle, this would be an important win for us with a meaningful portion of the $750 million. 2 prime contractors will be selected for the engineering, manufacturing and design phase of this project by June of this year. This phase is a new development and will ultimately lead to a final contract award in May of next year, which is a modest delay from our prior expectation. We're working with a number of prime contractors to provide our content on their respective vehicles. We're also monitoring an additional opportunity with this program. The Army has indicated it is considering to retrofit 30% of its current HMMWV fleet. That means approximately 50,000 to 60,000 vehicles could be added to this upgrade. This would most likely be a 20-year program with the Army. Also, this quarter, we received good news that more than 900 units have been added to the FMTV program. This additional build will now extend the program into next year. On Slide 6 is our volume outlook for the fiscal year. Overall, we're currently holding our global market forecast unchanged. In North America, our forecast is steady at 245,000 to 255,000 Class 8 trucks. The market is solid with December being an exceptionally strong month for orders. January orders will be very important in shaping the year. For defense, I've given you an update on HMMWV Recap and FMTV. As you know, JLTV is another defense program we're closely following. JLTV remains on schedule, with the engineering, manufacturing and development phase scheduled from August of 2012 to November of this year, with a final selection expected in late 2015. China's outlook continues to be consistent with volumes last year. However, we experienced a stronger-than-expected first quarter, primarily in the grader and loader segments. While this is encouraging, recent economic data suggest further weakening in the region. We'll need to see another fourth -- quarter before we consider changing our forecast. India continues to be under pressure. As we've told you, the elections in the spring will be an important event for the region. Currently, we see continued deterioration with little upside. Western Europe had a strong first quarter due to the prebuy I mentioned earlier. Our team performed well in quality and delivery with a solid contribution on incremental sales. While economic indicators continue to point toward a modest recovery, the first quarter prebuy presents an uncertain picture for the next several quarters. In South America, we're maintaining our forecast for medium and heavy-duty truck market at 175,000 to 185,000 units. The economy in Brazil continues to be challenging to forecast due to slower GDP growth, high inflation and a volatile currency. However, the agricultural sector has experienced record harvest, which has had a positive impact on the trucking business. Infrastructure demands also continue to be high due to the upcoming World Cup and 2016 Olympics. Now I'll turn it over to Kevin for a more detailed review of our first quarter results. Kevin Nowlan : Thanks, Ike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'll review our first quarter financial results and reaffirm our 2014 guidance. On Slide 7, you'll see our first quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales of $907 million in the quarter were up year-over-year by $16 million. The increase was due primarily to higher commercial truck production in Europe, driven by the prebuy associated with the Euro 6 regulation impact. In addition, South America revenue was higher on a year-over-year basis, as production volumes 1 year ago were still challenged following the Euro 5 emissions standards change. These increases were partially offset by lower military revenue and continued weakness in China. Gross margin was $20 million higher year-over-year due to the continued execution of our M2016 initiative. The gross margin improvement was primarily driven by conversion on higher revenues, execution of global pricing initiatives throughout calendar year 2013, continued net material labor and burden performance and lower structural cost resulting from actions executed largely in the second quarter of last year. All of this was achieved in a market environment where our FMTV volumes stepped down more than 30% year-over-year. So overall, it was a solid first fiscal quarter. SG&A was $3 million lower in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, as we continue to manage the fixed cost structure of the business. This quarter's restructuring costs were $5 million lower than the first quarter of 2013, which had included costs associated with the actions taken 1 year ago. Earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were $8 million in the quarter, down slightly from the prior year. This decrease was driven by the loss of earnings from the Suspensys joint venture, which was sold in July 2013. Interest expense was $2 million lower in the first quarter of 2014, driven by debt extinguishment costs of $5 million experienced in the first quarter of 2013 that did not repeat. Income tax expense was in line with last year, despite the fact that pretax earnings improved. As we continue to expand margins and improve the financial performance of the company, we expect to drive toward a more normalized effective tax rate. In total, adjusted income from continuing operations was $12 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $11 million, or negative $0.11 per share, in the same period last year. Slide 8 shows first quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. Sales in the first quarter of 2014 were $727 million, up $12 million from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $53 million, an increase of $19 million year-over-year. This represents a 158% upside conversion, due primarily to lower net material labor and burden costs as well as pricing actions in South America to recoup part of the FX depreciation experienced in the latter part of 2013. These positives, along with higher revenues in Europe and South America, more than offset the negative mix headwind associated with the step down in our FMTV business. Next, on Slide 9, we summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $208 million, up $5 million from last year. The increase was primarily due to a modest uptick in European aftermarket sales. Segment EBITDA was $19 million, an increase of $6 million year-over-year. The upside conversion was driven by pricing actions we executed throughout calendar year 2013. We also had lower net material, labor and burden costs. This EBITDA performance was achieved despite the headwind of not having earnings from the Suspensys joint venture. Now let's move to Slide 10, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from our fourth quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. Walking from the $70 million of EBITDA generated in our fourth quarter, we had $5 million less EBITDA due to mix. Our first fiscal quarter has less selling days than our fourth quarter, which affects our aftermarket business. In addition, production levels were down in South America and our FMTV volumes took another step down sequentially. So while we experienced a significant revenue increase in Europe driven by the Euro 6 prebuy, the benefit of that increased volume was not enough to offset lower sales from these other businesses, which typically have higher margins. The net result of this was an unfavorable net volume and mix of $5 million. The other notable item in the quarter relates to $5 million long-term disability liability reduction. We executed a change in our long-term disability benefit plan to reduce the duration of medical benefits provided to individuals in order to be more consistent with market practices. This cost reduction will result in real cash flow savings to the company in the coming years. Overall, this was a solid quarter for us. We believe this represents the highest reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in at least 8 years. While we have more work to do, we're off to a good start for 2014. Now let's turn to Slide 11. For the first quarter, total free cash flow was negative $16 million. This was a $90 million improvement over the same period last year, driven by higher net income and lower cash outflows for working capital. We also benefited this quarter from an increase in factored receivables, driven by higher sales in Europe, where we factor most of these receivables, and a new short-term factoring program in Brazil. These factoring programs have the effect of accelerating the cash cycle time. As production volumes in Europe are expected to take a step down following the prebuy, this first quarter cash flow benefit will become a cash flow headwind for us in the second quarter. Overall, while still a negative cash flow quarter, it's important to reiterate that our first fiscal quarter traditionally is challenging due to fewer selling days and calendar year-end cutoff issues. With that in mind, this free cash flow performance represents the best first quarter results since 2010. Next, I'd like to review and reaffirm our fiscal year 2014 outlook on Slide 12. As Ike discussed earlier, the demand assumptions are unchanged for our end markets. And as a result, we are maintaining our sales guidance of approximately $3.7 billion. While we see the potential for upside in markets such as North America, there is still significant uncertainty in Europe relating to the full year impact of the Euro 6 prebuy, and in South America and India. As a result, we'll have a better sense as to whether we need to make adjustments following another quarter of data. We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of approximately 7.5%, as well as our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance at $0.30 to $0.40 for 2014. Our first quarter has put us on track toward achieving these results. However, we must keep in mind that we continue to face the sequential wind down in our high-margin FMTV business, which will continue to be a margin headwind throughout the year. Total free cash flow is still expected to be between breakeven and positive $25 million. With the solid Q1 cash flow performance, we feel confident about our ability to deliver such a result, which would be our strongest full year free cash flow since 2010. Now I'll turn the call back over to Ike to wrap up and discuss our continued focus on M2016. Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Kevin. If you'll please turn to Slide 13. In our fourth quarter call in November, we provided you with detail on each element of our M2016 plan. Let me briefly summarize the highlights for you again because this plan is the roadmap to the financial results we have committed to achieving in 2016. The 3 financial targets we've established for M2016 address margin performance, net debt reduction and revenue. We intend to achieve a 10% margin for the full fiscal year 2016 through performance initiatives, incremental business wins and some market recovery. As we said previously, our cash flow breakeven is around 7% to 7.5%. We intend to drive performance that far exceeds this breakeven point so that we can consistently generate strong free cash flow. Last fiscal year, we reduced net debt by $216 million, which puts us more than halfway to our goal of $400 million. We're off to a good start but have more to do. We also reported $120 million of new business last year. We'll continue to scorecard ourselves annually against our target of a $500 million per year run rate, and we'll continue to tell you about new business we're winning around the world. M2016 has 9 specific initiatives that we believe will improve the performance of our business, resulting in achieving the financial targets that I just mentioned. In the first quarter of this year, we exceeded our operational targets in safety, quality, delivery and cost. Through continued execution of Lean concepts in our plants, we're taking the Meritor production system to a higher level in an effort to further improve our operational performance. We're making solid progress toward completing contracts with major customers. As we discuss our partnerships with these customers and others around the world, we're working closely with each one to ensure our product strategy is closely aligned with theirs. We're designing new features and enhancement to help our customers achieve their goals in safety, efficiency, performance and application coverage. We're confident in our ability to organically grow this business as we continue to engineer commercial drivetrain products that enhance mobility and maximize vehicle uptimes through superior engineering. Our products offer better performance at lighter weights for increased payloads and higher operating efficiencies. We're also actively pursuing various strategic approaches to reduce material cost, and we're seeing the results. Working capital is another area that we've targeted for improvement. We believe there's an opportunity to increase our inventory turns over the next few years. Overall, we're on track to meet our M2016 objectives. We've focused our resources onto the fine set of initiatives that we believe will lead to the achievement of the financial targets that we've detailed for you. We have momentum. We're celebrating our wins. We're challenging ourselves to do even more. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day in New York on February 6 for a more detailed discussion. Now we'll take your questions, and thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I was hoping we could talk a little bit about, just if you could help us out on the cadence of margins throughout the rest of the year. I know -- because typically Q1 is, as you mentioned, fewer production days. Your margin did come in above your full year range. You did mention some of the sequential FMTV headwinds. Hoping you can maybe quantify those, maybe just walk us through a little how we should think about the margin cadence in the next couple of quarters roughly. Kevin Nowlan : We're not going to give specific guidance on a quarterly basis, but I can tell you the way to think about it. Obviously, we had a good quarter here at 7.7% margin. A couple of the headwinds that you should keep in mind as we think about sequentially going into Q2 and beyond. One is we obviously had this one-time benefit from long-term disability, which was an execution item to reduce our cost structure. But that's not going to be an item that recurs in the next couple of quarters. Second is we do have continued step down in the FMTV business sequentially over the next few quarters. So you should expect that to be a headwind. And third, there is some risk related to the Brazil FX. I mean, even if you look at where that was yesterday, trading at $2.44, that's even a depreciation versus where we were at the end of the year. So while we won't give sequential guidance, you can expect that some of those things are impacting us as we think about hitting our full year 7.5% guidance. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Sure, that's helpful. Then on the fiscal '16 targets on revenue, I know you didn't provide a new revenue scorecard like last quarter. Maybe you could talk about the overall quoting booking environment that's out there, just your overall level of confidence today to achieve the $500 million target. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, we're not going to scorecard ourselves quarter-to-quarter on that. Obviously, we provided in our year-end call our scorecard in terms of having already generated bookings of $120 million on a run rate basis, and $110 million of which is going to hit in 2016. I think we are going to provide you a little bit more color at Analyst Day next week on some of the things that we think drive or help us achieve the targets as it relates to that $500 million run rate revenue target. Ivor J. Evans: I might add to Kevin's point, we have a very robust pipeline that we think is very viable and we continue to work that aggressively. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : That's great to hear. And just lastly, on the FMTV, the incremental vehicles into fiscal '15. Any way to help us quantify the impact to you from that extension? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think the way to think about it is next year, we were thinking that we would have no FMTV revenue. I think you should think about those 900-plus vehicles, I think it's 949 vehicles or so, as being about 30% of the volume that we would experience in FMTV in '14. So '15 volume in that regard would be about 30% of '14. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a follow-up on the earlier question on the FMTV. What kind of sequential headwinds are we facing? I mean, is it -- any color on the percent down over the next few quarters? Ivor J. Evans: Well, I think, as you know, we were about to -- we were going to lose all of our volume this year. So this is potential upside. Kevin Nowlan : And you should think about it as you go through the course of the year, we're down about 30% year-over-year Q1. But on a full year basis, we're going to be down about 55%. So I think that should just help you see that there are more step downs coming sequentially as we head into Q2 and Q3. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. And any color on how Brazil is trending? Are orders there still stable? I mean -- because I think there has been some... Ivor J. Evans: It's very difficult to forecast what's going on in Brazil. It's just been, for the reasons we outlined, it's been difficult. I mean, we -- GDP and inflation remain a concern. But the inventory levels are -- the good news, inventory levels are stabilizing. The FINAME program has been extended to this calendar year. So those are positives. But consumer confidence is weak. And so it's just very uncertain. But we're pretty confident that the 175,000 to 185,000 medium and heavy-duty trucks is probably a fairly realistic outlook. Kevin Nowlan : And then keep in mind, from a Meritor-specific perspective, we did have that new business win with DAF, which should help our revenue as we go throughout the year relative to -- in increasing share, you can think about it relative to the overall market there. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, that makes sense. And any update on the Eaton litigation? I mean, is the last date it's set to go to trial on June 23, or are there any additional updates? Ivor J. Evans: Well, the District Court ruled in favor of Meritor and against Eaton on a set of pretrial motions. And we had a pretrial scheduling conference, and the judge tentatively set a date for June 23. Eaton has asked for additional time for more discovery. And she has said that she will consider that and get back to us and determine whether she is going to hold the June 23 date, which would probably be an 8-day trial. But either way, we expect a trial date this year, whether it be June 23 or a little later in the year. But there should be a trial this year. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And just one last question on -- any color on the size of the factoring benefit in the quarter to your cash flow? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean, you could see the factoring was -- the good news coming through the factoring line was about $81 million. Now as you think about that -- and that's driven by Europe, where we had a big uptick in volume sequentially, driven by the prebuy activity. And we also had a new factoring program in Brazil, it's a short-term program that we had put in place. As you think about that from a headwind perspective going forward, I would think about it as being roughly half of that balance, maybe a little bit more of half of that balance being a sequential headwind as we go into Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : A couple of questions. First, on the litigation. Your General Counsel just retired or left the company. Does that -- is that -- could you just kind of comment on that and how that kind of fits into the broader litigation picture? Ivor J. Evans: Sure, Brian. Vernon had shared with us his plans to retire in the next several years. And was expected to leave. Vernon has been a valued member of our team. But we were opportunistic and found a great replacement. And as you probably know, finding good outside -- excellent [ph] counsel and corporate secretary can be difficult. So we decided to go ahead and proceed with that. We will be making an announcement shortly in that regard. And Vernon has also continued to -- continue in a consulting role with us for this next year. We do not see any impact at all to the Eaton suit. Kevin and I and Vernon have actually teamed this with outside counsel. We've had the same outside counsel for 7.5 years. So we don't -- there's no impact here at all, Brian. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And in terms of M2016, I guess, a couple of questions. How much of the low-hanging fruit has been harvested and kind of where does it go going forward? And kind of second, probably more for Kevin, is kind of on a sequential basis, it sort of looked like a wash, you had a little volume pricing. How do we kind of judge sequentially the impact of M2016? It looked good year-over-year, but sequentially, and it gets to that low-hanging fruit question, harder to see. Ivor J. Evans: Well, regarding to the low-hanging fruit, as far as margin performance, we feel very comfortable in our abilities to deliver our material net cost reductions. In fact, if you look at what we've identified and what we have to go get this year, it's very, very small. We're very confident we've demonstrated it in last year, as well as far as labor and burden improvement, and we're well on track through the first quarter this year in both labor and burden and material performance. So we're very confident, at this point in time, that we can continue with the Meritor Lean production system and continuous improvement, that the opportunity still exists. We have a -- and we also have not only, on our revenue side, a very aggressive pipeline, we have also identified a very solid pipeline of opportunities on the material and labor and burden front as well. Kevin Nowlan : And I think another thing to keep in mind, Brian, is that as you look at this year, we obviously ended last year with a full year EBITDA margin of 7.1%. We're guiding to flat revenue this year and margin uptick to 7.5%. And that's despite 2 pretty significant headwinds, 1 being the FMTV stepping down 55%. And I think we've given different data points over time which can help you kind of dimension the potential impact of that. And second, keep in mind, we don't have Suspensys anymore. So we've lost those JV earnings. And the combination of those 2 things are being overcome or overwhelmed by the performance that we're generating right now to allow us to generate improved margins. So as you think sequentially as we go forward toward M2016, those headwinds start to go away. Suspensys won't be a headwind again in '15. And FMTV, while it's got another step down coming, it's not going to be the same magnitude of headwind for the next 2 years. So as long as we continue to execute on the performance we have, we're going to start to see that performance flow to the bottom line without those same types of offsets we have here in '14. Ivor J. Evans: I was just going to say, if you'll recall, when I first came, I made an assessment regarding M2016 that this plan was doable and that we have the right management team to execute it, and nothing has changed in that regard. And you can see by the results that it's working. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, a couple of questions from me. First is, I know you have upcoming contract negotiations with Daimler and Volvo. Can you kind of give us a sense on the timing of that, and it's probably still early, but should we be viewing those as opportunities, or how easy is it to dimension the importance of those things to your profit outlook that you've outlined in 2016? Ivor J. Evans: Speaking specifically about Daimler, we're in a process of finalizing our contract renewal with them. We view them, clearly, as a strategic customer. And when we're in a position to make an announcement, we will do so. But we're very encouraged about our progress. Similarly, we're very encouraged about the discussions that we've had with Volvo. And we're not in a position to make any announcement in that regard. But we're encouraged with the discussions that we've had to date. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just on the -- some of the volume outlook. I mean, could I get just a general idea of, like, based on what you've seen with one additional quarter since you outlined your plan and your guidance for this year, what has come in, like what regions do you have more confidence in, what regions do you have less? I mean, I guess, within that, I'd be specifically interested in Europe, which you haven't really had a question on yet. With the prebuy, how much of what you've seen is really just pure prebuy? How much of what you've seen is actual activity picking up, and in first quarter, based on the kind of visibility of the order book, how difficult do you think that could be? So maybe just a couple of questions surrounding the volume outlook as it stands now. Ivor J. Evans: I would say the greatest uncertainty at this point in time is in North America. The December, Class 8 orders were very strong at 31,000 plus. So January will be -- we're really looking at this month orders critically. So, hopefully, there could be some upside there, we're not sure, but we'll have to watch that closely. The prebuy in Europe clearly helped the first quarter, and it kind of clouds the remaining 3 quarters. But maybe, Kevin, do you want to... Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean, I think you characterized it right. If you think about -- if your question's really where the risks and opportunities relative to the guidance that we're giving right now, I think North America is the one where there is the potential for upside, but we're not prepared to call that yet because it's just based on a month of orders. I think there are other regions, though, Europe, as Ike alluded to, South America and India, where I think there's continued risk in those relative to our guidance. I think still too early to tell at this point. And I think once we get one more quarter of data, we'll have a pretty good idea of where those markets are more likely to shake out. But at this point, that where the real risk and opportunity is. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just one clarification. The 10% EBITDA margin and the revenue target for 2016, you were able to -- do you still feel that you'd be able to achieve those things even in the absence of some major wins to replace FMTV? And I guess, on the back of that question, it seems like there are a lot of irons in the fire, so to speak, on military. And should those be considered maybe upside opportunities to that target? Kevin Nowlan : Yes it's -- I mean, the way we think about it is we feel really good about our ability to deliver 1.5 to 2 points of margin expansion, absent any volume changes from where we are today. And then the volume, which is a combination of new business wins that -- some of which we've already executed on, as well as the market recovery, those are the things that would get us the rest of the way to 10%. So right now, as we think about it, there is a little bit of dependence that we have on the markets and the new business wins, but the bulk of the margin expansion that we're driving toward right now is based on underlying execution and performance. So we expect we'd get to 8.5% or 9% without any volume help. Ivor J. Evans: But Patrick, as you look at our pipeline, we are not dependent upon any single program. We had -- the pipeline is very robust. And I would view -- I would look at the defense as some of the newest opportunity that presented themselves as just opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : A quick question on Latin America, long term. We've heard from -- on the light vehicle side, from a lot of the OEM suppliers, obviously, addressing the volatility and the lack of visibility in the region, and some of them even maybe downgrading their priorities in that region. Just want to get a sense of how you guys think of the Latin American market long term? And do you feel like your business is rightsized and nimble enough to deal with the volatility there? Ivor J. Evans: Well, to answer your question, we remain very bullish in South America on the long term. And yes, we think we have the cost structure to weather where we are today. But we're winning new business as we speak, and we've announced that with MAN and Phevos. So we are very bullish on particularly Brazil and Latin America. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. And just one housekeeping question. You commented earlier on the potential cadence of earnings through the year. What about cash flow? Do you expect that to be fairly back-end loaded in getting up to that 0 to $25 million? Or do you think it's going to be fairly stable through many quarters? Kevin Nowlan : It's -- normally, our stronger cash flow quarters tend to be the third and the fourth fiscal quarter. And I think you should think of that being no different this year. Because we do, as we come into Q2 here, we do have that factoring headwind I mentioned in Europe as those volumes come down following the prebuy and that factoring benefit unwinds. So I think you should expect that Q3 and Q4 will be the stronger quarters of the year from a cash flow perspective, but still in line with putting us on full year targets for 0 to $25 million of positive total free cash flow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky from Sidoti. Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Just looking at the balance sheet. It looks like the inventory turns have been turning down over the past 6 months -- 6 quarters or so, and your operations are supposedly getting better. And a, do I have my math right on inventory turns coming in? And why is that decelerating when the operations are getting better, material side especially? And what should we look for as -- when is the turn going to happen in inventory turns, and when are you going to get some of this shining through? Ivor J. Evans: You're correct that the quarter was not as strong on inventory turns as we'd like. We've identified what we need to do. We have not changed on where we think we can go long term -- longer term, which we think we can get to 10 turns. But Kevin, I don't know whether you want to add a little more color. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I'll give a little color, because that's right. I mean, Q1 is down from where we were in Q4. If you look year-over-year, just looking where we ended '13 versus where we ended '12, actually, our inventory turns are flat. Now we would have liked to have seen some improvement, but we didn't. Now as you look at a year-over-year basis, Q1 to Q1, actually, our inventory turns improved. And the reason they are down, though, on a sequential basis, is we tend to have some inventory build that we have in the first quarter as we prepare for aftermarket spring selling season coming up and some of the other volume preparation we do, as we have production shutdown in December, we need to be ready for the early part of the second fiscal quarter. So overall, I think we'd like to see our performance improving. But as you look at the year-over-year metrics, we have seen some improvements. So I'm not sure I would agree that sequentially, we're seeing it get worse and worse. I think it's been stable, really, as I look Q4 to Q4 of last year and then Q1 to Q1 as well, it's a little bit up. Ivor J. Evans: But having said that, it is one of our initiatives, and we're committed to improving our inventory turns. So... Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And is the 10x turn goal concurrent with M2016, is that end of the year then? Ivor J. Evans: Yes. Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Then otherwise, the -- I guess, in Brazil, are the DAF business and the new exposure you have to MAN, are those at full run rates right now or do those step up over the course of the year? Ivor J. Evans: They step up over time. Kevin Nowlan : The DAF one is happening right now, and the MAN-Phevos program starts several years out. It's not one that's in production right now. Ivor J. Evans: It's a modest revenue in '16. Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Then finally, how are you thinking about China. Because you seem kind of cautiously encouraged, I guess, by what you're seeing in some product lines. CAT seemed like they're a little bit constructive as well, but obviously, there's a lot of negative headlines in the newspaper, so I'm wondering what you think about the China big June quarter season. Ivor J. Evans: Well, we successfully completed the consolidation of our operations, and we saw really nice margin improvement. We've got the right cost structure. Grader and loader segments did show some signs of improvement. But overall, look at the mining segment, it's at depressed levels. And there's still some inventory out there for cranes. So we are, as we said in the call earlier, let's wait another quarter, and we'll come back to you on that one. Right now, we're kind of seeing it as flat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Kind of following on with some of the questions that Patrick asked. This is just clarification on my part. My understanding is that roughly, I think, 150 to 200 basis points of the M2016 margin expansion is due to a combination of some execution on your part but also some pricing, which I think feeds into the idea that you're negotiating with Daimler and Volvo, and so on and so forth. Can you do 2 things here? One, can you just give us the timing as to the contracts, Daimler and Volvo, when is the expiration? Just remind us there. And then, secondly, am I correct in my impression that you seem to feel pretty good about how those contract negotiations are going with respect to your M2016 targets? Ivor J. Evans: First of all, one of the pricing actions, Brett, is with our aftermarket. And we are achieving that. As far as Daimler is concerned, we're really excited about the discussions that we're having with them. And we'll -- to be announced at a later date. We are actively engaged in productive discussions with Volvo. The Volvo contract expires in Europe at the end of this year. So -- but in all cases, these are strategic customers for us. And we are engaged and involved and the discussions, at this point in time, are all positive. Kevin Nowlan : And keep in mind, I think one of the things we've said is as you think about this OE contract renewals, it doesn't mean there are meaningful price movements in all of those contracts. I think we're focused on a couple in particular that we feel like are maybe underpriced. And so I don't think you should have an expectation necessarily that every OE contract necessarily translates to some sort of significant step up in price. The other question you asked there about Daimler. The contract actually expired December 31. But as you can imagine, with the strategic relationship that we have with Daimler, we continue to supply Daimler, and we continue to have a constructive relationship and hope to have something to talk about in the near future. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, secondly, and again, Patrick asked this question, but I just didn't quite understand the answer. You outlined a number of military opportunities here on Page #5. And as we think about the $500 million target, how much is baked into that? Ivor J. Evans: The -- there's -- the HMMWV is in our pipeline. And as I said, we didn't discount any of the programs in that pipeline, but we've discounted the total. So we're not dependent on any particular program. I mean, we could not get HMMWV and still be okay with the incremental revenue growth that we're talking about. We're just encouraged about where we are with HMMWV right now because of -- with the selection of the -- where the Marine Corps is in their process. Kevin Nowlan : And then as it relates to the FMTV, I mean, it's -- the extension of the program into '15 is nice, but that doesn't help us on a run rate basis. So that volume, you're not going to see us count that towards the $500 million of revenue. But the HMMWV is one of those programs that we're focused on among a lot of others as we drive toward the $500 million. Operator : You have no questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Carl D. Anderson: Thank you for your participation in today's call, and this concludes our first quarter earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Evans: Thank you, Carl, and good morning. Please turn to Slide 3. Our second fiscal quarter was characterized by solid execution as demonstrated by the financial results you see in our press release. Across the company, we're fully aligned to our M2016 and determined to achieve our targets. That determination is reflected in our performance again this quarter. I continue to be impressed with the commitment of our leadership team and all of our employees to make Meritor a premier company for our shareholders and customers. Higher revenues combined with continued cost performance improved our EBITDA margin by 170 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Total free cash flow was $9 million representing the best second quarter results since 2010. We also successfully executed several capital market transactions this quarter. At our analyst event in February, we told you that our priorities were to maintain strong liquidity, to assess our liability structure and prudently manage our debt maturity profile. The actions we completed in the quarter support each of these priorities and ultimately provide us with greater financial flexibilities. With regard to our outlook for the fiscal year, we're pleased to announce that we are increasing guidance for revenue and earnings. With our first half performance, combined with expected higher revenues in the second half, we've increased our guidance for both adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. As you know, a major element of M2016 is winning new business. On Slide 4, you'll see that we reinforced our partnership with Daimler Trucks North America this quarter by completing a new 4-year agreement. This contract represents an important partnership with a long-term customer, our largest in North America and second-largest globally. With the agreement, we retain standard position for air drum brakes and drivelines and hold our strong optional position for front and rear axles. In addition to the DTNA agreement, we also -- we won new business with Daimler India. For this award we will supply Daimler with our MS-145 axle for its BharatBenz rigid truck. The 145 is Meritor's highest volume axle for global applications. It was the primary axle used in North American linehaul for more than 20 years and is highly adaptable for a variety of applications. We look forward to continuing the relationship we've enjoyed for many years with Daimler and we are working together on future business opportunities. On Slide 5 is a comparison of our sequential performance. Revenue increased $55 million to 6% quarter-over-quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes across both segments in North and South America, partially offset by lower volumes in Europe as a result of the first quarter pre-buy. Adjusted EBITDA was $78 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.1%, an increase of 40 basis points, mainly driven by higher revenue and our continued focus on reducing costs. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $21 million, up $9 million from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.22, an increase of $0.10. Free cash flow was $9 million compared to an outflow of $16 million in the prior quarter. Let's turn to Slide 6 for a revised market outlook for the fiscal year. Arrows on the chart indicate the segments where we revised our forecast. In North America, our forecast has increased 20,000 units for a new range of 65,000 to 75,000 (sic) [ 265,000 to 275,000 ] Class 8 trucks. As you know, orders over the past 4 months have shown considerable strength year-over-year. Despite March orders being down close to 6% sequentially, they were still up more than 24% from March of last year. The Class 8 order board is at a 22-month high at 4.9 months. As a result, OEMs are increasing production rates. Moving to China, you may remember that our revenue in the region was down approximately 40% last year. Coming off that low base, we now expect revenue to increase 10% over the prior year, as inventories that were consumed by OEs are being replenished. However, we do remain cautious on this market. In South America, we are anticipating a meaningful decline in demand expectations for the second half, resulting in a reduction to our forecast for the medium and heavy-duty truck market of 20,000 units. Our updated forecast is now for 155,000 to 165,000 medium and heavy-duty trucks. As we moved into the second quarter, OEs built up inventory in anticipation of higher demand, but with continued economic headwinds and uncertainty, that demand is not materializing, causing OEs to decrease production and take days out of their schedules. Inflation of approximately 6%, low GDP projections and increasing market interest rates are continuing to deteriorate consumer and business sentiment. The World Cup, which starts on June 12, is also expected across some level of production disruption, and the election in October is creating further uncertainty. In Defense, new prime contractors will be selected for the engineering, manufacturing and design phase of the Humvee program in August or September of this year. As a result, we expect the final contract award to be in September of 2015. The Marine Corps has established its acquisition quantity to be roughly 1,600 vehicles and has increased the acquisition price from $110,000 to $145,000 per vehicle. The JLTV program is on track with a final selection also expected in late 2015. Please turn to Slide 7. As we watched demand increase in North America over the past 4 months, we've initiated actions to ensure we're prepared to support our customers at higher volumes. We're taking a forward-looking approach that includes global coordination and detailed market reviews with our customers. We've improved our operating efficiency and capabilities to support our customers. We've invested in our precision forging presses and taken steps to upgrade machining and assembly operations in the United States and Mexico. We're working with suppliers to mitigate risk associated with key commodities, and we're strategically building inventory to avoid pinch points that we've dealt with in the past. With the detailed plan we have in place, we're confident in our ability to execute well. Our objectives are to maintain high customer satisfaction and delivery rates while converting on additional sales in line with normal levels. You will remember that in the first quarter of 2014, axle production in Western Europe was up 30% year-over-year. Using the approach I just outlined, we successfully avoided -- we successfully achieved excellent delivery performance and managed cost for strong conversion. We expect to have the same results in North America. Now I'll turn over the call to Kevin for a more detailed review of our second quarter results. Kevin? Kevin Nowlan : Thanks, Ike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'll review our second quarter financial results and take you through our updated 2014 guidance. On Slide 8, you'll see our second quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $962 million in the quarter, up year-over-year by $54 million or 6%. This increase was due to higher commercial truck production in all of our geographic regions, but most notably in North America and Europe. In addition, revenue was slightly higher in our Aftermarket & Trailer segment. Our only business that was lower on a year-over-year basis was Defense, as FMTV revenue stepped down by nearly 50%. Gross margin increased $21 million year-over-year due to the continued execution of our M2016 initiatives. This improvement was driven by conversion on higher revenues and continued net material, labor and burden performance, and keep in mind that this increase in gross margin was achieved despite the significant year-over-year step down in FMTV volumes. SG&A was $1 million higher in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. However, as we look at SG&A as a percentage of revenue, we actually experienced a slight decrease on a year-over-year basis. This is the result of our continued focus on managing the overall cost structure of the business. You should expect this disciplined approach to continue even as revenue increases. This quarter's restructuring costs were $9 million lower than the same period a year ago. As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2013, we recognized an $11 million expense primarily for employee severance costs associated with our segment reorganization and our Asia Pacific realignment. Earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were $9 million in the quarter, down slightly from the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to $4 million of lower earnings from our Suspensys joint venture, which was sold in July of last year and is no longer contributing to our earnings. Interest expense was $23 million higher in the second quarter of '14 driven by the loss on debt extinguishment relating to the repurchase of our 10 5/8% notes due in 2018. You'll note that we have included an add-back of $21 million in adjusted income from continuing operations associated with this loss. Later, I'll provide more detail on what these transactions mean for our debt maturity profile. Income tax expense increased $2 million in the second quarter of 2014. This increase was driven by higher earnings in jurisdictions where we recognized tax expense. In addition, no tax benefit was recognized on the loss on debt extinguishment incurred during the quarter since this loss was recorded in the U.S. where we currently have a valuation allowance. After adding back the debt extinguishment loss, adjusted income from continuing operations was $21 million or $0.22 per share compared to $6 million or $0.06 per share in the same period last year. Slide 9 shows second quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. Sales in the second quarter of 2014 were $763 million, up $51 million or 7% from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $57 million, an increase of $20 million year-over-year. This represents 39% upside EBITDA conversion due primarily to improved net material labor and burden performance and higher volumes across all of our commercial vehicle markets. These positives more than offset the negative mix headwind associated with the step down in our FMTV business. Next, on Slide 10, we've summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $232 million, up $8 million from last year. The increase was primarily due to higher European sales and North American pricing initiatives executed over the past year. Segment EBITDA was $22 million in the second quarter and was flat compared to last year. The EBITDA benefit of higher revenue was offset by the loss of earnings year-over-year from our previously divested Suspensys joint venture, as well as certain inventory reserves booked in our second quarter. Now let's move to Slide 11, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q1 to Q2. Walking from the $70 million of EBITDA generated in our first quarter, we had $17 million more of EBITDA due to volume, mix and pricing. This is primarily driven by higher revenue in both segments across North and South America. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue in Europe as production levels stepped down following the Euro 6 pre-buy that occurred during our first fiscal quarter. We also executed pricing actions in our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, which contributed sequentially to our results. Next, you recall that in the first quarter, we recorded a $5 million accrual reduction associated with a change we made to reduce benefits provided under our long-term disability plan. This did not repeat in the second quarter, so it is a headwind in our sequential walk. And finally, we have an all other net decrease in EBITDA of $4 million when compared to the prior quarter. This includes additional inventory accruals in our Aftermarket business, as well as the impact of the Brazilian real depreciation. Overall, this was another solid quarter for us. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $78 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%. We are continuing to build upon the performance we have delivered over the last several quarters and remain focused on achieving our financial objectives. Now let's turn to Slide 12. For the second quarter, total free cash flow was $9 million. This represents a $35 million improvement over the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher adjusted earnings, lower pension contributions, lower cash interest and a decrease in restructuring payments. Working capital, including the impact of our factoring programs, negatively impacted our cash flow by $37 million in the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, our first quarter cash flow was positively impacted by higher sales in Europe where we factor most of our receivables. This had the effect of accelerating the cash cycle time in Q1. As production volumes in Europe took a step down in this quarter following the pre-buy, the first quarter cash flow benefit from factoring became a cash flow headwind for us in the second quarter. In addition, as Ike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to build strategic inventory buffers to support an upturn in the North American market, so this had a modest impact on working capital performance in the quarter and will continue to impact us in the second half of the year. Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of our liquidity and debt maturity profile. We completed several capital market transactions during the second quarter. First, we issued $225 million of 6 1/4% notes due in 2024. The proceeds from this issuance were used, along with balance sheet cash, to call $250 million of our 10 5/8% notes due in 2018 and to pay off the remaining $41 million term loan balance. These transactions resulted in gross debt reduction of $66 million and will generate annual cash interest savings of approximately $14 million going forward. During the second quarter, we also amended and extended our revolving credit facility. The maturity date for the revolver was extended to February 2019 and we improved the drawn pricing by 75 basis points. In addition, we increased the facility size to $499 million through April 2017. After which time, the facility will step back down to $410 million through maturity. From a liquidity perspective, we used cash to help fund the debt repurchases I just spoke about. However, as a result of the revolver amendment, we largely offset the liquidity impact of using that cash by upsizing the revolver more than $80 million. As a result, we ended the quarter with $795 million of liquidity, only slightly below last quarter's balance. Completing these actions has allowed us to achieve greater financial flexibility and has provided us a clear runway in which we have only $170 million of funded debt coming due over the next 5 years. In fact, 85% of our funded debt doesn't mature until 2019 and later. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2014 outlook on Slide 14. We are raising our fiscal year 2014 sales guidance from approximately $3.7 billion to a range of approximately $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. This increased sales guidance is due to a strengthening North American Class 8 truck market, and to a lesser extent, increased revenue expectations in China. This revised sales guidance also takes into account the effect of the weaker market in Brazil. We're also raising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance from approximately 7.5% to approximately 7.7%. We expect better second half performance than originally planned due primarily to the revenue upside we're seeing particularly in the North American Class 8 market. But second half performance is tempered somewhat as we manage headwinds in 2 of our higher-margin businesses, as well as modestly higher steel cost in North America. We are taking down our production forecast for South America due to the softness in the commercial vehicle demand in that region. And in the case of our Defense business, we expect revenue to be lower by more than 50% in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, due to the continued step-down in FMTV production. It will be important to keep these headwinds in mind when thinking about our third and fourth quarters from an earnings perspective. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a range of $0.50 to $0.60 for fiscal year 2014, which is an increase of $0.20 compared to our prior guidance. This increase is driven by the expected improvements to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the benefit of lower interest cost resulting from the capital market transactions we executed. Total cash flow is still expected to be between breakeven and positive $25 million. As the North American market continues to strengthen, we are ensuring that we are prepared for increased demand by putting strategic inventory buffers in place where necessary. This investment in working capital will position us to convert on the North American market upturn. But even with these inventory buffers, with the first half performance, we're confident in our ability to deliver this free cash flow guidance, which would be our strongest full year free cash flow performance in 4 years. Now I'll turn the call back over to Ike to provide closing remarks on our continued forward momentum. Ivor J. Evans: Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 15. When we met with you in February, we highlighted several reasons that make Meritor a sound investment. This quarter, we made solid progress with accomplishments that further validate our investment thesis. First, we said we had a clear and simple plan to improve performance in 2016. That plan is working. As I said earlier, we're aligned and focused on 9 objectives, and we're on track to achieve the 3 financial metrics we have established for EBITDA margin, net debt and incremental revenue. Also in the second quarter, we launched our new air disc brake program with Scania in Europe. This business was part of the $120 million pipeline we captured last year. We have strong partnerships that we're focused on growing. We're proud of our new 4-year agreement with DTNA, which is a year longer than the last agreement, and we're ready to begin new axle business with Daimler India. We're also working hard to build and sustain relationships with other important global players like Volvo, Navistar, MAN, DAF and Mahindra to name just a few. Our margins are improving. In the first quarter, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin 250 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, margins grew by 170 basis points from the same period last year. We briefly told you our liquidity was strong and we were evaluating further action to improve the balance sheet. We did that this quarter with a series of transactions. Our cash flow is improving. In the first quarter this year, we had the strongest first quarter free cash flow since fiscal year 2010. This quarter, we had the best second quarter results since that same year. Defense programs, including the Humvee Recap and the JLTV, continue to show good potential for Meritor. Meritor's ProTec High Mobility Suspension successfully completed 100,000 miles of on- and off-road testing in Lockheed Martin's JLTV. This equates to about 62% of the required test miles. The transformational change in our approach to material cost management is working. As you saw, material performance this quarter helped contribute to our favorable results. And our global operations are getting more efficient. In Europe, we achieved a 98% delivery and strong conversion during the first quarter pre-buy. We now believe we are in an up-cycle for Class 8 trucks in North America with the best 4-month period of orders from December to March since 2006. We are ready and responding as demand increases. We're managing the process carefully to ensure we convert incremental sales at normal levels, which would reflect better performance than in previous production cycles. Overall, we're showing consistent improvements in financial performance, balance sheet management, cost structure and operational excellence. We're also winning important new business with large global players. Raising guidance for the full year is further indication that the actions we're taking are sustainable. We are building momentum and looking forward to the second half of the year. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault, Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe a couple of questions here. Why don't we just start off with -- on the Commercial Truck side. You had very, very strong conversion on the revenue, and I think you highlighted some of these, I guess, burden and material benefits that you put in place that are sort of paying off. Can you speak to the sustainability of that kind of a conversion in subsequent periods kind of hitting what's implied by your guidance, and potentially if we can talk about sort of beyond 2014, that would be helpful as well. That's my first question. Ivor J. Evans: Patrick, the answer is yes. But as far as specifics, Kevin, do you want to go ahead and... Kevin Nowlan : Yes, sure. Patrick, it's Kevin. With respect to the sustainability, I mean, this is part of our M2016 initiative. As we look at material, labor and burden performance, we have specific objectives in that regard. In material, we're driving for 2.5% annual net material performance; in labor and burden, in the same zip code; and we're were achieving it. We achieved it last year in '13, we're on pace to achieve it in 2014. So it's 1 of those 9 key strategies we're focused on in terms of driving that type of performance as part of M2016, and we expect to sustain that and deliver that through M2016. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And so no kind of unusual commercial settlements or anything sort of helping the result this quarter? Kevin Nowlan : No. And I think you can see that when you look at -- it wasn't just this quarter. It was last quarter and it's been prior quarters. I mean, we continue to see that improvement in our margin, so it's not a 1 quarter phenomenon, what you're seeing. You can see it quarter-over-quarter continuing. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And I guess, just looking kind of turning forward one page in your slide deck here, Aftermarket & Trailer, can you just give us a sense of what the kind of outlook is for that? I feel like there's sort of less of an understanding, less transparency in terms of the real revenue drivers there. So what should we be looking at to sort of gauge the opportunity there from a top line and maybe in terms of a conversion as well? Ivor J. Evans: Patrick, I'll go ahead take a pass at it, and if Kevin can add a little more color, fine. But Aftermarket is tracking to forecast and the trailer market has picked up nicely. So we feel very encouraged about both our Aftermarket and our Trailer business as well. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything you want to further... Kevin Nowlan : I mean, we're definitely seeing, on a year-over-year basis, the Aftermarket business is up from a revenue perspective with truck production, and that's why we provide the U.S. truck freight ton-mile as kind of an indicator, a directional indicator as to what we expect in the Aftermarket performance from a revenue perspective. And then from a margin perspective, Aftermarket has historically been one of our better contributing margin businesses. So we would expect to generate pretty healthy conversion as we see revenue growth there. Now this quarter, on a year-over-year basis, that was tempered by the fact that we no longer have Suspensys helping those earnings, so that's a year-over-year headwind, and we did have some modest inventory accruals that we booked in the quarter for E&O. So -- but overall you should expect that to be one of our better converting businesses. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then on that, like Suspensys, I should know this but this was something that wasn't consolidated and was there for helping EBITDA but not revenues, is that correct? Kevin Nowlan : Exactly right. So on a year-over-year -- so second quarter of a year ago, we generated about $4 million, $2 million of which was in the Aftermarket & Trailer segment. The other $2 million was in the Truck segment. So Aftermarket's down $2 million year-over-year, but exactly like you said, it was EBITDA with no sales. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then just the reserves that you've taken, is that kind of a one-time thing, or are those kind of accruals that are ongoing as the revenue is picking up? Kevin Nowlan : I wouldn't call it a one-time thing. I mean, every quarter, we're assessing our inventory for excess and obsolescence to see if there are any inventory adjustments we need to make. And from time to time, we make adjustments. So it was a small amount, couple of million dollars in the quarter. And it happens from time to time, particularly in businesses where you carry a lot of inventory to support that business like the Aftermarket business. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Last one for me. Can you just -- any update on discussions with Volvo? Ivor J. Evans: Patrick, as you know, our contract expires this fall in October. We are encouraged with our discussions, but we don't have any announcements to make at this time. I think that if you step back, the good news from both Volvo and our perspective is that we both see long-term value in our relationship. And I think it's fair to say that we see a path forward, but I don't really have any more than that at this point in time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays Capital. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just want to start in the CB [ph] division by asking a little bit more color on the impact of Brazil, Venezuela or other countries in South America. What was the drag there, if any? What does it look like going forward? And then where -- if there was a drag, where were the key offsets and kind of -- and maybe just gives us some color on how you're managing that situation as it kind of went through the quarter? Kevin Nowlan : Brian, it's Kevin. Are you referring to FX related or something broader? Ivor J. Evans: Or are you talking the economy? Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : FX inflation, weak economies, government in Venezuela that's on the -- following the Fidel Castro model, just the whole collection of [indiscernible]. Ivor J. Evans: Okay. So before Kevin answers, the good news is we're not in Venezuela, so we don't have an issue with FX coming out of Venezuela. But Kevin? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, that's exactly right. We don't have any Venezuelan exposure, so from a market perspective or an FX perspective, there is 0 exposure that we have to that market. From a Brazilian perspective, obviously, it's an important business for us. I think it was about $450 million in revenue last year and we have had some FX headwinds there. I mean, for the quarter, the Brazilian real was about 2.35. Keep in mind, a year ago it was about 2. So on a year-over-year basis, that's impacted us quarter-to-quarter, Q2 to Q2, about $22 million in revenue, the Brazil real, and about $5 million or so in EBITDA. But sequentially, it didn't have a big impact on us even though there was some depreciation, maybe about $4 million of revenue in the quarter. The good news is we're offsetting that with performance, so you're not seeing that pop as a real big bad news item that's not being offset by other things like volume, mix, pricing and performance. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then secondly, anything you can update us on the Eaton litigation and kind of timeline for that? We know there's a court date currently scheduled for June 23. Ivor J. Evans: That date is still a good date, and we expect the trial to last 8 days as we've communicated before. But really don't have any more to update than that, Brian. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then final kind of question. As you kind of look at the margin progress here, as well as in your guide, and you're kind of thinking about M2016, to what extent would you ascribe the margin improvement to, a, revenue just showed up better than you expected due to cyclical factors? Or versus, b, we executed better and had revenue been, say, a bit lower or -- where would it have been [ph], I think Ike will kind of recognize this as a question has boss back at Emerson would've asked. That is, are you actually operating better or did you just get some -- something from tailwind? Ivor J. Evans: Brian, we are operating more efficiently across the globe, our material and burden and labor cost reduction initiatives are bottom lining, and it was all part of M2016 that we would -- in difficult markets, that we would improve our EBITDA margins. But Kevin, you want to add a little more to that? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I will. I mean, as you look at 2014, I mean, the primary reason why we're taking up our guidance is obviously driven by revenue but our ability to execute on converting on that revenue. And we're guiding to a range on revenue and we're guiding to approximately margin. But if you just kind of do the math on some of the midpoints, it would imply a high-teens conversion on that revenue, which is showing that the cost performance initiatives that we are executing are sticking and that we're able to convert successfully on the incremental revenue we're seeing. And we would expect that to continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan, UBS. Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : This is Rahul Chadha on behalf of Colin. I just want to understand, it seems like in the first half, the margins have been pretty strong, 7.7% in Q1, 8.1% in Q2. So why does your full year guidance only stop at 7.7%? Is there room to go above or is it just being conservative? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, I think there's a couple of headwinds that we need to keep in mind as we look at the second half of the year. The first starting with kind of markets and the mix impact of that. We obviously have South America where we're taking down our guidance on the second half of the year with that market coming down quite a bit, so that's impacted the way we think about the second half versus what we were thinking before. Second is, our military business, which is another high-margin business for us, is down 50% in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Big mix impact for us there. And finally, in the North American market, with the upturn, we have seen steel indices increase on a year-over-year basis. As you look at bar and hot-rolled, I mean, you're seeing up about 7% or 8% on a year-over-year basis, we saw the indices peak in January. And so that's going to have an impact on us in the back half of the year. And even though we have recovery mechanisms, those recovery mechanisms, as you recall, are on a lag, and so we're not likely to get the recovery on those until early in '15. So those are the things, as you think about why second half is implicitly guided to something lower than first half. Those are the headwinds that we're seeing and to keep in mind. Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : That's very helpful. And then one question on the Military business. Any update on potential wins which were in the pipeline or in the near-term? Ivor J. Evans: There's 2. Humvee timing, we expect 2 contractors to be selected for the EMD, or the Engineering Manufacturing Design phase. That should occur late August or September of this year, and we expect the final contract to be awarded a year from now -- a year from September 2015. And the JLTV is, we expect that selection to be late 2015. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're performing well on the test phase with Lockheed Martin. Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And could you remind us, was any of this baked in the $0.5 billion incremental revenue target in M2016? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, those initiatives, along with a number of other initiatives, are baked into the M2016 target. But keep in mind, we have a pipeline that far exceeds the $500 million target we're driving for. We embed all of the initiatives that we're working toward and then we put a discount factor on that, kind of a macro-level discount. And there's no single award that would -- that if we didn't win, would cause us to miss that target. So while those are important programs to hitting $500 million, we're not dependent on any one program to hit the $500 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky, Sidoti. Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Just a quick question on China. Was this a -- I guess more clarification, was this a restocking that you saw there, or are we're just seeing demands at the point where it's mirroring end-user demand? And also any thoughts about growth in excess of the market, either on-highway or off-highway? Ivor J. Evans: No, you got it right, Robert. It was restocking. It's a replenishment of inventories at this point in time. And obviously, as I mentioned, we're coming off a weak comparison. So we're not declaring victory as far as the Chinese market, but we are seeing some increase orders to replenish inventory. Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And then secondly, SG&A has been under pressure for quite a few years now. You've done a really good job on just driving that lower. And if we do have some -- little bit better cyclical end markets over the next few years, would you expect to see an inflationary growth rate in SG&A, or is it still going to be a source of like an absolute dollar attrition? Ivor J. Evans: No, we expect to be able to, as we increase revenues, to be able to leverage our functional spend. It's something that we pay attention to, we work hard on it. And obviously as we win new businesses we may have a few incremental increases. But overall, we expect to be able to leverage our functional spend going forward. Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Would you expect growth in absolute dollars? Ivor J. Evans: There could be some incremental dollar growth. But as far as rate, we should expect to be able to see that being leveraged. And you saw that, by the way, in the sequential walk from last quarter to this quarter as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Brett had to sign off, I'm representing Brett Hoselton. A quick question for you. As we move into the third quarter, your comparisons become much more difficult. I'm trying to understand how you can -- I know you don't provide guidance on a quarterly basis, but if you can maybe directionally guide us into what we can expect from your end markets? Kevin Nowlan : We're not giving specific guidance, obviously, on each of the last 2 quarters. You can do some of the math, though, and look at what our guidance is implying about the second half of the year, and obviously, it's implying that our margins are going to be down. So you're absolutely right when you look at Q3. Q3 is a difficult comp for us given that we generated 8.8% EBITDA margin in that quarter. But again, keep in mind we do have some headwinds heading into the second half of the year that I spoke of earlier that'll hit us over the course of the next 2 quarters. I talked about how we took down our guidance in South America, FMTV stepping down and the modest increase in steel economics that we're seeing in North America. Operator : [Operator Instructions] At this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Carl D. Anderson: Thank you, Glen.

Ike Evans :  Thank you, Carl, and good morning. Please turn to Slide three. We reported another strong quarter driven by our M2016 initiatives. Despite continuing softness in all of our markets outside North America, we delivered an 8.1% EBITDA margin largely due to our continuous focus on reducing net materials costs and improving labor and burden performance. On year-to-date basis, we're demonstrating real year-over-year improvement. Although not shown on the slide, sales for the first nine months increased 63 million or 2%, EBITDA increased 37 million or 19% for a conversion rate of 59%. And EBITDA margin year-to-date is 8%, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. Cash flow has also been strong year-to-date, and we expect to end the year with the strongest cash flow performance since 2010. Other third quarter highlights include a signed MoU with Volvo, that covers our global axle business, the antitrust settlement with Eaton, the announcement of an equity repurchase program, and for the second consecutive quarter we have increased our full year earnings guidance. We're increasing our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS from continuing operations and free cash flow for the year. Kevin will provide you with more details, but the increase in our full year expectations for earnings reflects the strength of our third quarter performance driven by our M2016 initiatives, some of which I'll highlight for you in a moment. Slide four shows the sequential comparison of our results. Revenue increased 24 million from the second fiscal quarter to 986 million. Higher revenues from our truck and aftermarket businesses in North America partially offset lower sales in South America and the defense business which had a negative mixed impact on our earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was 80 million, up 2 million from the prior quarter. Continued improvements in net material and labor and burden performance were offset by the unfavorable mix impact I just mentioned. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat from the prior year at 8.1%. Adjusted income from continuing operations was 28 million, up from 21 million in the second quarter, due to the lower interest expense and higher adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.28, an increase of $0.06 quarter-over-quarter.  : On Slide five, we provide you with more detail on the non-binding MoU with Volvo. As most of you know, our contracts for Europe and South America are scheduled to expire in October of this year. Based on the MoU executed in July, we expect to sign a new long-term agreement prior to the expiration of our current contract. With the new agreement, we'll provide axles to Volvo for seven years in Europe and South America, and axles and drivelines for four years in North America. Well, that's all the detail we can provide at this time. We're encouraged to have a solid path forward in our partnership with Volvo. This business will contribute to our M2016 revenue target that we'll update in November. Please turn to Slide six. An important part of our M2016 growth strategy is to win new customer business that drives profitable growth. We were recently awarded new axle business with Kamaz Motor in India. Kamaz builds vehicles for applications ranging from mining to construction and heavy duty infrastructure projects. Beginning December of this calendar year Meritor will supply this new customer with fully-dressed tandem axles. We're also pleased to finalize a long-term agreement with Hino. With this agreement, we'll supply our second largest medium-duty truck customer with axles and brakes through March of 2017. Let's now move to Slide seven. Largely driven by our intense focus on M2016 initiatives, we're getting healthier in every area addressed by our plan, and that is driving better financial performance. Operational excellence is an important piece. So, we'd like to give you a glimpse into how we're building our operational strength with engaged teams. Our safety, quality and delivery metrics are better than it had been in recent history. Last month, I made an impromptu trip to our largest axle plant in North America to congratulate them on achieving 500,000 hours, which is equal to about six months without a recordable injury. The plant also received awards in the state of North Carolina for being 50% below the state safety industry standard. We want our people to go home the same way they came to work. And through training, employee involvement, improved levels of machine guarding the communication we're achieving a high success rate. With regard to quality, seven of our plants are in PACCAR's 50 PPM quality awards for 2103, and we received the DTNA Masters of Quality award for the same timeframe. Our PPMs in North America truck are the lowest they had been in six months, but I can tell you we're still looking for ways to get better. As for delivery, we achieved a 98.9% on-time delivery in North America for the month of June. This is our best on-time delivery in six months, which also happens to be our highest production month for rear axles in that same timeframe. I also want to spend a minute on labor and burden, because it's a great example of how we're building on one of our inherent strengths. We have 6400 production employees and 300,000 part numbers delivery that require consistently perfect coordination. We're achieving this through a multidisciplinary cross-functional team effort. Engineers are working diligently to maximize uptime and throughput. One example, this is the work they've done to eliminate a heat treat process; by employing controlled cooling technology to manufacture drive pinions for gear sets, we're eliminating the need to heat treat without impacting quality or durability. This will shorten lead time, reduce inventory, and it's expected to save approximately 400,000 annually.  : The opinions of every team member matter. We've had thousands of employee suggestions that have contributed to our labor and burden savings. With closely aligned and engaged cross-functional teams, our metrics in these areas are better than ever, and that translates to financial improvement. Slide eight is a recap of the facts related to the antitrust settlement with Eaton. We're reaching a settlement that we believe was in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. Another terms of the agreement, Eaton paid 500 million to ZF Meritor resulting a net after-tax proceeds to Meritor of 209 million. In the last decade, only five other defendants have actually paid private antitrust claims of more than 500 million. Proceeds will be used primarily to pre-fund the next three years of mandatory pension contributions in the United States and the United Kingdom. : Once we achieve our target, Meritor's Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase of up to 210 million of equity or equity-linked securities. We anticipate completing the entire 200 million repurchase program by the end of fiscal year 2016. Please turn to Slide nine for a slightly revised market outlook from last quarter. Our forecast for Class 8 trucks in North America has increased by 5000 units, for a new range of 270,000 to 280,000 units. A healthy backlog-to-build ratio and low cancellation rates are two of several positive indicators. While the summer months tend to be slow for orders, we're continuing to see a high level of interest in equipment purchase with June orders being up 41% from June of last year. We believe the North American truck production will remain strong into the beginning of fiscal year 2015. In South America, we're reducing our medium and heavy duty truck production forecast for the second consecutive quarter. We now anticipate production to be in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 units, down 10,000 from last quarter. While our inventory levels are beginning to decrease due to OEM shutdowns, the region continues to experience economic headwinds and restrictions related to FINAME financing. The consumer confidence index reached its lowest point in five years, this June. As a result, you should anticipate that we'll take the necessary actions to manage our cost structure appropriately. When we provide our fiscal year update in November, we'll share with you an overall look at the markets for fiscal 2015. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin for more detail on our financials.  : Once we achieve our target, Meritor's Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase of up to 210 million of equity or equity-linked securities.

Kevin Nowlan :  Thanks, Ike, and good morning everyone. On today's call, I'll review our third quarter financial results and take you through our updated 2014 guidance. On Slide 10, you'll see our third quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $986 million in the quarter, down slightly year-over-year by $7 million or 1%. This decrease is due to lower commercial truck production in South America and lower revenue from our defense business as FMTV's production volume continues to step down. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in North American commercial truck production and higher revenue from our aftermarket and trailer segment. Gross margin increased $14 million primarily due to $12 million warranty contingency that was booked in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding this, gross margin increased by $2 million despite the decrease in revenue, including the year-over-year step-down in FMTV production. This improvement was driven by continued execution of M2016 net material, labor and burden initiative. SG&A was $13 million lower in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. The decrease includes the $20 million recovery of current and prior year legal fees associated with the Eaton antitrust settlement. This is partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and higher legal defense cost associated with asbestos-related claims. Next, earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were $201 million in the quarter compared to $15 million in the prior year. The increase was due to $190 million of affiliate income related to the gain recognized from Eaton antitrust settlement. Excluding this, earnings in our minority-owned affiliates decreased by $4 million year-over-year primarily due to the sale of our Suspensys joint venture, which was sold in July of last year and is no longer contributing to our earnings. Interest expense is $23 million lower in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. The decrease is related to $19 million loss on debt extinguishment that was recognized in the third quarter of last year associated with a repurchase of debt securities due in 2015. The decrease is also due to lower cash interest resulting from the capital market transactions executed last quarter. Moving down the income statement, income tax expense increased $10 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a $9 million tax benefit that was recognized in the third quarter of 2013 associated with the settlement of certain Canadian pension plans. And finally, adjusted income from continuing operations was $28 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to adjusted income of $33 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same period last year. The impacts of Meritor from the Eaton antitrust settlement is excluded from adjusted income. Slide 11 shows third quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck and industrial. Sales in the third quarter of 2014 were $761 million down $23 million or 3% from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $55 million, a decrease of $12 million year-over-year. The decrease in segment EBITDA was primarily due to lower revenue and the unfavorable mix impact associated with lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and the step down in our FMTV business. Next, on Slide 12, we summarize the aftermarket and trailer segment financial results. Sales were $259 million, up $21 million from last year. The increase is primarily due to higher revenue across all parts of the segment. Segment EBITDA was $26 million in the third quarter and was up $1 million compared to last year. The EBITDA benefit of higher revenue was partially offset by the loss of earnings from our previously divested Suspensys joint venture. Now, let's move to Slide 13, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q2 to Q3. Walking from the $78 million of EBITDA generated in our second quarter, we had $2 million of unfavorable impact on EBITDA due to volume, mix and pricing despite higher consolidated revenue. The favorable impact of higher revenue in North America and our aftermarket and trailer segment was not enough to offset the unfavorable mix impact of lower South America and defense sales. Next, we continue to execute on our M2016 objectives of achieving that material labor and burden savings. These initiatives provided an incremental $2 million net benefit this quarter even after giving consideration to modestly higher steel prices in North America. And finally, we have another net increase in EBITDA of $2 million. Overall, this is another solid quarter for us. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $80 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%. As Ike pointed out, we continue to execute on our M2016 cost reduction initiative to drive margin performance, while at the same time managing through the dynamics of our global end markets. Now, let's turn to Slide 14. For the third quarter total free cash was $71 million representing a $43 million improvement over the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by lower pension contribution and lower cash taxes. We are pleased with our free cash flow performance this quarter. This result reflects the best third quarter free cash flow performance in five years. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2014 outlook on slide 15. Our fiscal year 2014 sales guidance remains unchanged at a range of approximately $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. Although the North American class 8 market is strengthening, we are seeing continued headwinds in Brazil. As a result we are keeping our revenue forecast flat compared to the guidance we issued in the prior quarter. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance from approximately 7.7% to a range of 7.7% to 7.9%. The increase in margin guidance reflects solid execution of our M2016 cost reduction initiatives during the first three quarters of the year as well as our conversion on additional sales in the North American and European commercial truck markets. Our year-to-date margin performance indicates that we are on track to achieve a solid full year adjusted EBITDA margin result, the keys is on the path to achieving our M2016 margin target of 10%. With this said, as you think about the fourth quarter from an earnings perspective, it's important to keep several things in mind. We expect overall revenue to decline sequentially from Q3 due to the European summer holidays. We also continue to expect headwinds in two of our higher margin businesses as the South American truck market remains soft and FMTV production continues to wine down. In addition, we receive updated yearend liability evaluations in September. Any adjustments required as a result of these evaluations would be recorded in the fourth quarter and could impact margin performance. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a range of $0.65 to $0.75 for fiscal year 2014, which is an increase of $0.15 compared to our prior guidance. This increase is primarily driven by the expected improvements in adjusted EBITDA and lower tax expense. We're also taking up our total free cash flow guidance from a range of $0 to $25 million to a range of $50 million to $75 million. The increase is a result of the strong free cash flow performance so far this year combined with our expectations for the fourth quarter. We are confident in our ability to deliver this free cash flow guidance which would represent our strongest full year free cash flow performance in four years. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Ike to provide closing remarks. Ike Evans : Thank you, Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 16. I said at the beginning of the call, our financial performance this quarter was strong, and our year-to-date performance clearly demonstrates that we are focused in the right areas. Our alignment around M2016 targets includes all areas of our global organization. Today, we discuss just a few examples of the work we are doing to continually improve our operational performance. I am proud of our teams around the world who are working together closely with our customers to improve the company and to meet our requirement. We're winning new business and the Meritor brand in strong and growing. This quarter we signed an MoU with Volvo in anticipation of extending our actual supply agreements with our largest global customer. And in July, we entered into a new contract with Kamaz in India and extended our partnership with Hino for another three years. You'll remember last quarter we signed a new four-year agreement with Daimler Trucks, North America. Although certain international markets remain soft, we are executing and converting on the F-Cycle and Class 8 trucks in North America. We're confident and we have momentum. As Kevin told you, increasing our guidance reflects good execution and effective cost reduction initiatives combined with strong conversion on incremental sales. Our year-to-date performance demonstrates that we are getting real traction to achieve sustained improvement in our fashion or performance. We remain on track with our M2016 objectives. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And that question comes from Colin Langan. Please go ahead, Colin. Colin Langan - UBS: Great, thanks for taking my question. Any color on how we should think about the profit impact from the change in the Volvo contract. I mean, is that something that we'll see rather immediately once the final contract is settled or is that something that may be a benefit over time because my understanding is that the European contracts have generally \u2026 Ike Evans : Colin, we spent over a year working with Volvo on this MoU. And we both expect to sign the long-term agreement prior to the expiration of this contract. However, due to the confidentiality provisions of the MoU, we can't provide you with any more detail. The bottom line though is we're confident, we have a solid path forward with this important global customer. And our focus is to continue to providing them with superior quality delivery and products that help [to freight] (ph) their trucks in a regional market. And that's as much as we can say at this point in time. Colin Langan - UBS: Any color on prior contract, so the changes occur immediately or if they usually face them? Ike Evans : I can't say any more than what I've already said, Colin. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. Kevin Nowlan : Colin, this is Kevin. As you look historically, I mean we've had -- this has been a 10-year agreement with Volvo in Europe, so we haven't had a whole lot of history in terms of that. But I think the expectation is that we would execute the long-term binding agreement at the end of this -- at the maturity of this contract, which is the beginning of October of 2014. And the new contract would kick in after that. That's the expectation. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Any color on the aftermarket, trailer business is up 9% year-over-year, what was driving that strong growth in that segment? Is that a market or is that market share? Ike Evans : It's primary market, Colin. We had really strong markets. Kevin Nowlan : And that's inclusive of trailer, which our trailer market has been up and even our European aftermarket business which is up as well. So it's really across the entire segment. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. And just one last one; and you talked about it a bit, why the expected slowdown into Q4, that's just the normal seasonal pattern or anything else going on in Q4? Kevin Nowlan : Well, the first thing to keep in mind, yes, there is some seasonality there. Remember Europe right now is shutdown. And so we lose several weeks of production in the fourth quarter. So that has a big revenue impact on us as we go from Q3 to Q4 and obviously we lose conversion on that. Second, we do have a little bit more step down going into Q4 from the defense business and then of course South America remains soft. So I think those are the key drivers that we are focused on as we think about why our implied Q4 guidance would be softer than where we ended Q3. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. We have another question for you. This one comes from the line of Brian Johnson. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Yes, good morning. A couple of questions about these results and where they get you towards M2016; the first is, you had very good incrementals overall in the commercial vehicle segment. And you flagged the two headwinds, defense and South America and then the tailwind in North America. If you look within North America, were you comfortable with the incrementals that you were getting on what I assume was a revenue increase there given the 8% increase? And are you comfortable that as North America continues to grow, you can continue to bring that to the bottom line versus the problem Meritor had in the last up cycle of having premium freight over time and others actually detract from profits. Ike Evans : Brian, the answer is, yes, we're converting successfully. As we've committed before we said we will convert at least 15% rate on incremental revenue and we are executing on that. And we expect to continue to do so. Kevin, I don't know if you want to add any more to that. Kevin Nowlan : I think that's right. And frankly that part of it as we think about. The reason I think Q3 came in a little bit stronger, we had really good material labor and burden performance in the quarter which overcame the steel. But we also had good conversion on the North American sales I think stronger than what we've historically seen when we were in the midst of an upturn. As we stay here today, we are not prepared to declare victory. We have a long way to go through this upturn, but I think we are pretty pleased with the incrementals that we've achieved today. Ike Evans : And Brian, if you remember in my comments in the call, we are delivering basically world class quality and virtually 100% on time delivery. Brian Johnson - Barclays: And we will probably hear more in the fall about this. But as you just look at the M2016 earnings kind of implied margin guide, do you need the North American Class 8 truck market to get back to 320 to 340 and further strengthening in Europe, Brazil, India and China, or is there enough momentum on the cost side of M2016 and perhaps that's what you are getting out of restructuring your European business and contracts that you don't need to get the revenue number there to get that kind of numbers you were talking about. Kevin Nowlan : It's a good question, Brian. I think where we sit today -- we are not necessarily counting on North America to be sitting at a 300,000 Class 8 market. We generally use some of the services; LMC, FTR and others across the globe to assess what we think the markets look like. As you know, when we talked about our 10% margin guidance, we talked about it in the past as needing to hit 4.5 billion of revenue, which fundamentally, what's underlying that is recovery in markets like South America, India, China, Europe, more so the North America. In fact I think North America given where we sit today versus a couple of years from now could be a little bit lower at least on the truck side. I think as we sit here today, that 4.5 billion that we've laid out is probably -- it needs those markets to come back, and who knows where that's really going to be two years from now. But I'd tell you given where we sit today, we believe that we can achieve 10% margin even if we fall short of that 4.5 billion target, and I think will provide a little bit more clarity on that when we get into November timeframe on the earnings call. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Brian. We have another question for you. This was from Patrick Archambault at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Patrick. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a good result. I am going to start by pushing my luck on the Volvo question. I guess is it at least safe to say certainly you would never have agreed to a contract which at least didn't keep the profitability similar or better. I think we can comfortably assume that just given how much of a priority this was? Ike Evans : Well, Patrick, thank you for -- it was a good quarter for us. Really it's not a delivery to be able to say anymore than I've already with regard to Volvo. Other than that we are both our companies are excited about the prospects I moving forward. I mean this is seven years for Europe and South America and four years for North America for axles and drive lines as well. So this is exciting. This is our largest global customer. It's 27% of our sales. So I mean we are excited about this as overall Volvo. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : And I'm going to have to push my luck again. On the four years for North America is that I mean at least just structurally in terms of the way things are framed, is that kind of four years and then the contract is up for re-bid or renewal or is like is there an in-sourcing that happens after four years for the North America piece? Ike Evans : At this point who knows four years from now, but at this point in time Volvo and we've sat down and we view ourselves as a long-term commitment on our part or their part to be their actual driveline supplier for North America. Kevin Nowlan : I'd add to that, Patrick, keep in mind that the North American agreement actually wasn't scheduled to mature until 2015, the spring of 2015. And as the parties were moving forward in the discussions around Europe and South America and Australia, we decided it was in the best interest of both companies to address that contract now even though it could have ordinarily waited a little bit longer. So we are extending four years from next spring, which is basically 2019. And I think that's indicative of the strong relationship we have with Volvo right now. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Got you. Okay. Thanks for the color. On a couple of other ones from me, just in terms of FMTV, can you just remind us of the cadence? Now it does step-down sequentially in your fourth fiscal quarter, are we at kind of close to zero at that point or just can you remind us of sort of when that eventually peters out and then actually if you could also just refresh us on the timing of some of the other potential opportunities to replace it like the HMMWV Recap and such. Kevin Nowlan : Let me start with FMTV and talk about that, and then I'll turn it over to Ike to talk about the future programs. With FMTV we're seeing another sequential step down here in Q4. If you look at Q3, been on a year-over-year basis were down almost 60% in that business. And for the full year we expect to be down about $100 million FMTV and revenue. As we go into next year we expect that we will have roughly level production release the first few quarters of 2015 roughly the same as what our Q4 production is. So I think you are going to see a step down in Q4 and then probably flat for several quarter before the program ends. Remember there is 949 more vehicle sets to be produced in '15. And again that's indicative of basically several quarters of flat and then probably falling off at the end of the year next year. Ike Evans : Patrick, we continue to support both the marine's and the army's developmental programs as far as HMM-WV Recap or the HMMWV Recap program is concerned. On July 28th the government indicated that the Marine Corps is analyzing its acquisition strategies to enable mission achievement within budgetary constraints. We'll closely follow updates on this evaluation, but the bottom line for Meritor is as we've said in the past that our M2016 targets are not really dependent on any single program. We have a very robust pipeline. So if this doesn't materialize we will still be in good shape. But however we wanted to, but we can't give any further update because we don't know other than what I just told you. As far as the JLTV program, it's on track with final selection still expected, middle of next year. The government has issued a draft request for purchase as planned at the end of -- did it at the end of June. We provided our response to our partner, Lockheed Martin. And we've already indicated that the (indiscernible) is on schedule for down selecting the summer of 2015. So that's the status of both of those. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Terrific, and one last one if I may, just the reason for the decline in CapEx \u2026 Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I don't think there is any significant reason. I think as I talked about on prior quarters, we tend to have some lumpy CapEx projects from time-to-time. And some of those projects have either not happened this year or on the timing that we expected. I think the other thing to keep in mind if we manage the CapEx pretty closely. We are not looking to cut CapEx, it hasn't been our strategy. But we need to make sure that the CapEx projects that we have in the hopper meet the return that's required to deliver a good return to our shareholders. So I think you can expect some lumpiness, and I think as you think about us going forward, 2% of sales is a good way to model us as you think about going forward even though we're running a little late on that so far this year. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Okay, it makes sense. Thanks a lot guys for taking my questions, and congrats again on a very good result. Ike Evans : Thank you. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Give me two seconds. And Kevin, we have another question for you. This is from Irina Hodakovsky from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: Good morning everyone. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning. Ike Evans : Good morning. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: I had a question for you on the SG&A line, and Kevin you mentioned a $23 million recovery in legal fees, and increase in incentives and legal fees for asbestos. Overall, it seems if I add that 20 million that came as a substantial step-up in SG&A as a percentage of sales, I'm wondering if you can give us any guidance on how we should view this going forward into 2015. Kevin Nowlan : And I think -- you're absolutely right. So, of you strip out the $20 million from SG&A associated with Eaton, our SG&A was up about $7 million. And there is a couple of drivers of that, one is we did have some increased incentive compensation accruals as we look at how we're tracking relative to our plan, which is we're tracking fairly well. Second, we did have some incremental asbestos related to legal defense cost. That's both defending cases as well as we're going after a couple of insurance companies with trials upcoming in the fall to allow us to obtain insurance coverage for claims that are coming out in six, seven, eight, nine years from now. So that's a couple of the key movers in the SG&A line that were negative. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: And so they found isolated to the 3Q and we really shouldn't expect them to go on into 2015? Kevin Nowlan : I think those were both probably a little higher than what we'd have expected. In incentive compensation I think we're doing a little bit of a true-up given our performance coming in a little bit stronger. The defense cost, I think we have to monitor. It really depends on what cases are going to trial, what cases we need to defend in the near-term. So it's something we keep a close eye on. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: Thank you guys very much, and congratulations on a great quarter. Ike Evans : Thank you. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have another question for you. This is from the line of Kirk Ludtke at CRT Capital Group. Please go ahead, Kirk. Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Good morning everyone. Ike Evans : Good morning. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning. Kirk Ludtke - CRT: I might have missed it, but could you quantify the new business that you've won in the quarter and where you stand with respect to the $500 million target in your M2016? Ike Evans : We're going to dimension that on an annual basis, and we'll do that at the November earnings call. So, the Kamaz win is actually a contributor to the $120 million that we've earned today. It was actually a pretty good contract for us from a revenue perspective. The Hino contract is an extension. So that one, you won't us see counting towards the 500 million, but the Kamaz one does count, we're not going to dimension win-by-win, but we'll dimension it in aggregate when we get to the end of the year, November. Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Okay, thank you. And with respect to Volvo, you have an MoU, and you haven't revised your 2016 target, so is it safe to say that the MoU is consistent with the targets? Ike Evans : The answer there is due to the confidentiality provisions of the MoU we can't provide you any more details on that. Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Okay, it's worth a try. And then, with respect to the industry, in North America, are you seeing any bottlenecks anywhere? It doesn't sound like you see any bottlenecks in your system, but do you see any bottlenecks away from you? Ike Evans : We work hard on this. As we said, our capacity is around 300,000 North American markets. We work daily with our customers and our supply base to ensure that we were able to meet our customer's requirements. We're tracking all our commodities and we just stay on top of this. And the good news is we're converting, and we had 98.9% delivery rate in June. So I think we're delivering to our customers. I can't comment as to whether any other suppliers out there might be having pinch points. Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Okay. I appreciate it, thank you. Ike Evans : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Kirk. We have another question for you. This one is from Robert Kosowsky of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: Yes, just a quick question on the Kamaz business. Does this bring over some of the off-highway technology you have in China over into India, and do you see India being a bigger launch pad for off-highway, and where is that right now? Ike Evans : Not really, Robert. It's off existing platforms and it's a neat opportunity for us. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Okay, thank you, Robert. And we have another question. This one is from Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Chris Reenock - Citigroup: Hi, thank you. This is Chris Reenock for Itay. I just had a question on margin. You talked about H2 in general should be a weak result, just based on South America and defense, but you still delivered in Q3 an 8.1 really strong margin. Just wondering besides the revenue's sequential step-down, what else are drivers of potential weakness in Q4? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I'd say outside of revenue, which is a big one because we do lose a lot of significant amount of revenue when Europe shuts down and we lose the contribution on that, so that's a big piece. But the other pieces are South America continuing to remain soft. It's our military business taking another step-down going from Q3 to Q4 as we've talked about it in the past as the high margin business. And then, we do have some hedge for some potential if we have any year end accrual adjustments. As you know, every year we do liability assessments, actuarial evaluations on some of our longer data liabilities, and sometimes those result in adjustments that can impact margin. So I think those are the three things in addition to revenue that we think about as potential headwinds in the fourth quarter. Chris Reenock - Citigroup: Okay, great. And so again, understandably South America was weak, just wondering if you -- if and when you anticipate a flattening there and how you're looking at the region going forward? Ike Evans : We don't know. We don't have a crystal ball. All the economic indicators are not really good. So what we're going to do, we'll take the appropriate cost structure actions that we needed to do to manage effectively in this region, but no one has a crystal ball as to when this is going to return. Kevin Nowlan : And so I think it will be -- have some uncertainty as we head into '15, and I think we'll give some more updated guidance in November as how we think about '15 is playing out. But I think we do -- it's important to keep in mind we do think longer term we're pretty bullish on the South American market even though we're going through some tough times right now. It's been a good market for us, if you look versus 10 years ago where this market was I mean it's more than doubled. So, it's a good market, lot of good opportunity up there and we make good money. Ike Evans : If you think about just six months ago, our customers and our sales, we were bullish on this market. So the market can be volatile. It can go down and it can come back just as quickly. Chris Reenock - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thank you, and congrats. Ike Evans : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this stage. Therefore, I'll hand back to Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Carl Anderson : Thanks, Ian. We appreciate everybody's participation in today's call. If you do happen to have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me directly. And this concludes Meritor's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conversation, gentlemen. This concludes the presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Evans: Thank you, Carl and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turn to slide 3, our companywide alignment to achieve our M2016 objectives drove improved financial performance year-over-year. Our results reflect strong execution, driven by a focused effort to convert on the upturn in North America and to effectively manage our operating and product cost.  Although revenue was only slightly up over the prior year, EBITDA margin increased from 7.2% last year to 8.3% this year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $1.02 from $0.42 per share last year and free cash flow for the year was $138 million, our best cash flow result in several years. Efforts to improve our balance sheet this year also paid off.  Our eight year pursuit of the antitrust settlement with Eaton as well as treasury actions we executed throughout the year resulted in us achieving our M2016 net debt target two years early. We also extended important long-term supply agreements; one with Volvo our largest global customer and another with Daimler, our largest customer in North America. In June we announced a share repurchase plan of up to $200 million of our equity or equity linked securities that we intend to initiate this year and complete by the end of fiscal 2016.  Let\u2019s turn to slide 4 for an update on our M2016 metrics. Our performance in fiscal 2014 puts us on track to achieve our EBITDA margin target of 10% in fiscal 2016. Despite headwinds, including the wind down of our defence business, a challenging South American environment, and a loss of earnings from the 2013 sale of our Suspensys joint venture, we improved our margin by 110 basis points.  This was largely due to a concentrated effort by our global team to reduce material costs, better manage labor and burden, and pricing actions. With our strong margin performance in 2014 that exceeded expectations and our outlook for fiscal 2015 we are even less dependent on end markets than our original M2016 planning. We now believe we can achieve a 10% EBITDA margin at revenue levels as low as $4.2 billion, clearly demonstrating our ability to successfully mitigate micro economic headwinds. On slide 5 you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve reduced net debt by close to $500 million since 2012 resulting in net debt of $1.439 billion. This settlement with Eaton, proceeds from the sale of our former joint venture, free cash flow generation, and pension de-risking strategies were important elements of strategy that drove this achievement. As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, this change in our debt structure allows us to begin executing our buyback program this year despite a likely increase in pension liabilities due to a new mortality table change. Slide 6 shows the progress we\u2019ve made toward our revenue target of $500 million. We\u2019ve added $60 million in new business relative to what we reported to you last year. With the $120 million we earned in fiscal 2013, we are now $180 million towards our target. However market deterioration primarily in South America has negatively impacted this figure by approximately $35 million. So while we won $180 million in new business, we are only score carding ourselves at $145 million to take in account the market softness that we expect to negatively impact revenue.  Despite the current volume weakness in global markets, we do have a robust pipeline and are confident in our ability to achieve the $500 million revenue target. On slide 7, we highlight two major contract renewals we announced this year. The contract with Daimler represents the continuation of an important partnership.  With this agreement we retained standard position for air drum brakes and drivelines, and hold optional position for front and rear axles. With the new Volvo agreement we\u2019ll provide axles for 7 years in Europe and South America, axles and drivelines for 4 years in North America, and axles in Australia for 4 years. We also extended an agreement to supply Hino, our second largest medium duty truck customer with axles and brakes through March of 2017.  Please turn to slide 8. We are designing and manufacturing a broad portfolio of products that meet our customer needs for efficiency, flexibility, reliability, and high value. This is the Meritor value proposition that is allowing us to maintain and grow business with existing long-term customers and win new contracts with OEs around the world. In September we displayed our global capabilities at the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in Hanover, Germany that includes the products you see on this slide. Our global engineering network is enabling us to design products for unique regional needs like the RPL 35 drivelines for North and South America that feature high torque capacity equipped to handle engine downspeeding and heavy service applications. As you know, downspeeding is a current trend in the industry that employs direct drive transmissions and fast axle gear ratios to maintain vehicle road speed at lower engine RPM which as you know supports the industry demand for fuel economy. Beginning in early 2015, we will also launch a portfolio of products that offer a 228 ratio on our 14X Tandem for 6x4 long haul applications and 231 ratio on the new FUELite Plus Tandem for the 6x2 market. These fast axle ratios can be integrated with our RPL 35 drivelines.  In Europe we have launched the 17X EVO drive axle that was recently designed for 4x2 applications in that region. This axle is built with advanced technologies for greater durability and substantial reductions in fuel consumptions. It will also be offered in South and North America for the 6x2 segment. While this product is compact and light weight, it has expanded capacity for 50 ton payloads and superfast ratios to deliver additional fuel economy. Engineered initially for the light vehicle, commercial vehicle market and segment in India, our 10X axle is built for higher payload capacity, fuel efficiency, and strength to accommodate road conditions for challenging terrains. This fully addressed axle provides our customers with single drive solution for the light duty market. We plan to also launch this product in South America.  As I said, our long-term success is contingent on the products we bring to market. Efficiency gains, adaptive designs, extended life, and customer support are the characteristics that differentiate Meritor products in our global markets.  Please turn to slide 9 for a fiscal 2015 market outlook. As you know, North America is in a strong market upturn right now. Class orders, Class 8 orders for October came in at 46,200 the best month since March of 2006. ACT attributes to the demands in new truck fuel economy and proves that economics and freight sectors, rising freight rates and the fleet profitability. This recent order activity indicates that this cycle has a longer run giving us confidence in our outlook for fiscal 2015. We anticipate Class 8 buyings for the year to be in the range of 290,000 to 300,000 units and Class 7 volumes to be between 210,000 to 220,000 units for our fiscal year. We also expect trailer volumes to remain strong, up slightly from what we saw this past year. There are several factors we watch closely in North America like driver availability, the shift of production to Mexico, and hours of service rules that our line of site tells us that 2015 will be another strong year in this cycle.  Europe and South America are a different story. In Europe we are projecting our medium and heavy duty truck production to fall by approximately 3% year-over-year. The economic indicators in Europe are fluctuating making it difficult to closely gauge this next year. However, some indicators are trending negative and truck registrations had decreased in some countries.  South America is the big story right now in terms of economic outlook. Brazil is technically in the recession, GDP growth is negative, inflation continues to increase, unemployment is showing signs of deterioration, and the currency continues to weaken. Commercial vehicle markets reflect these worsening conditions which is why we expect fiscal 2015 volumes to be lower at 140,000 to 150,000 units. With the outcome of the election in October, we will be closely watching the region as the incumbent President begins her next term.  While bullish on South America, in the longer term we expect markets to remain under pressure for a period of time. With regard to China we expect China will be up slightly this year. And end of the year market segment is improving following the election earlier this year, driving higher medium and heavy truck volumes. On slide 10, I want to spend a couple of minutes on our performance during the upcycle in North America. Last February at our Analyst Day event we told you we were prepared for the high volumes we were anticipating in fiscal 2014. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, our daily axle production is up 25%. Throughout this cycle, we will remain focused on achieving our targeted conversion rates while not allowing premium cost to meaningfully impact our bottom line.  We have done that through effective management of cost and close collaboration of demand requirements with our customers and suppliers. While at the same time our delivery performance was 90% on time and our customer PBM was 68. This is the new Meritor. Not only is our execution strong as demonstrated during this cycle of North America and earlier this year in Europe during the pre-buy but our overall financial performance is proving as well. Our results this year were positively impacted by our performance during this upturn.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin for more financial detail. Kevin? Kevin Nowlan : Thanks Ike, and good morning. On today\u2019s call I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. And then I\u2019ll take you through our 2015 guidance. We achieved solid financial results for the quarter generating $35 million of adjusted incomes from continuing operations and expanding our adjusted EBITDA margin by 50 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. As Ike said, our results reflect excellent execution driven by our commitment to achieve M2016 objectives. Our team successfully converted on the high volumes in North America and managed our operating and product cost well around the globe.  Before we get started in reviewing the financials let me point out that we\u2019ve recast all current and historical results to reflect the Mascot remanufacturing business' discontinued operations. In August we announced that we would exit this business and in September we signed a definitive sale agreement.  On slide 11 you\u2019ll see our fourth quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $933 million in the quarter up $31 million or 3% year-over-year. The increase is primarily driven by higher sales in North America as the Class 8 truck market continued to strengthen. This is partially offset by lower commercial truck production in South America and Europe as well as lower revenue from our defence business.  Gross margin was $31 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. The improvement includes a $15 million benefit related to the curtailment of our U.S. retiree medical plan. Excluding this benefit gross margin still increased $16 million, which reflects 130 basis points improvement. The expansion in gross margin was driven by higher revenue and the continued execution of our M2016 initiatives. We continue to have strong net material, labor and burden performance in the business which is a key component of our margin expansion objectives. Keep in mind that this increase in gross margin was achieved despite the significant year-over-year step down in revenue from defence and South America.  I should also note that the margin improvement includes an $8 million benefit relating to the favorable resolution of the warranty contingency that we originally booked in the third quarter of 2013. We\u2019ve excluded the $8 million benefit from adjusted EBITDA consistent with the charge that we took in 2013. SG&A was $19 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily due to higher as best as related expenses as well as higher variable incentive compensation cost.  Next, the other line item encompasses the remaining items that impact our operating income. The $7 million cost in 2014 relates to the restructuring actions we took in our South American business in response to the difficult market conditions there. This is consistent with what we announced in August. The prior year expense of $71 million is primarily related to a charge that we took associated with buyouts of term vested participants in our U.S. defined benefit pension plan.  Interest expense was $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $27 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the losses on debt extinguishment related to two initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter. First, we executed the repurchase of the remaining $84 million of our 8 and 1/8th notes due in 2015.  Second, we also opportunistically repurchased $38 million of our 4% convertible notes in the open market as we continue to delever the company and improve the balance sheet. You will note that we have included an add back of $10 million in adjusted income from continuing operations associated with the loss on these transactions. This loss was partially offset by lower cash interest expense we\u2019re now experiencing due to the capital market transactions we executed in the second quarter of this year that reduced our gross debt balances.  Moving down the income statement, income tax expense decreased $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. Remember, when we sold our stake in Suspensys last year we incurred a $33 million capital gains tax which is included in this line item. That explains the bulk of the year-over-year improvement but in addition to that during 2014 we experienced lower earnings in jurisdictions such as Brazil where we accrue income tax expense. All of that totals up to adjusted income from continuing operations of $35 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to adjusted income of $13 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year. This represents 169% expansion of adjusted earnings per share on slightly higher revenue.  Slide 12 shows fourth quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck in industrial. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $729 million up $20 million or 3% from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $53 million, a decrease of $1 million year-over-year. Conversion of higher sales in North America and continued strong material and operational performance were more than offset by higher variable incentive compensation accruals and the unfavorable mix impact associated with lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and lower defence revenue.  Next, on slide 13 we summarized the aftermarket and trailer segment financial results. Sales were $240 million, up $13 million from last year. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue in North America. Segment EBITDA was $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, up $7 million compared to last year. This increase is due to a combination of improved pricing in our North America aftermarket business and a charge related to value added tax that we incurred last year which did not repeat.  Now let's move to slide 14 which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q3 to Q4. Walking from the $82 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in our third quarter, we had an $8 million unfavorable impact due to volume mix and pricing. The favorable impact of slightly higher revenue in our North America truck business was more than offset by lower defence sales and lower sales in Europe resulting from the summer holiday shut down.  Next, we continue to execute on our M2016 objectives of achieving net material, labor, and burden savings. These initiatives provided an incremental $4 million net benefit sequentially from the third quarter. Also as I mentioned earlier we recognized a $15 million onetime benefit associated with the curtailment of our U.S. retiring medical plan. At the same time we incurred a $20 million charge associated with the remeasurement of our asbestos liability at year end. I will cover both of these items in more detail on the next slide.  And finally we had $7 million of favorability due to other year end liability evaluations. This includes evaluations for such items as workers compensation, long-term disability, and product liability. When you think about the large pluses and minuses coming from the OPEB curtailment gains and the various year-end evaluation adjustments of our accruals they largely net out. As a result we chose not to adjust any of these items out of our reported adjusted EBITDA.  Overall then this was another solid quarter for us. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $80 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.6% which means we were able to successfully manage downside conversion to only 4% in the quarter. If you adjust for the large pluses and minuses that occurred at year-end, our downside conversion would still have been only 9% which is below the normal expected 15% to 20% we told you to expect with changes in revenue.  Now let's turn to slide 15. I want to spend a couple of minutes explaining the two large P&L items that impacted our Q4 results. First, during the fourth quarter we amended our U.S. retiree medical plan for non-union salaried workers by eliminating certain pre-65 medical coverage and life insurance related benefits. The decision to eliminate these benefits was based on a comparison of our benefit programs and coverage levels to those of other companies. We recognize that $15 million benefit associated with these changes which as I noted on the prior slide is included in our adjusted EBITDA results. Also during the quarter we received our annual evaluations related to 10 year estimate of asbestos liabilities. As part of this evaluation we review each significant assumption impacting the projected liability including trends in claim filings and costs associated with defending claims. Each year end we also update our insurance receivables based on changes in the underlying liability forecast and our assessment of recoverability. These insurance receivables reduced the amount of the net liability that we reflect on the balance sheet and that can mitigate the size of the charge that we recognized when the growth liability increases.  This year's evaluation update resulted in a meaningful increase in our net liability stemming primarily from increasing claim filings, higher projected defence cost, and a write off of a disputed insurance receivable. As a result, we recorded a $20 million charge associated with the year end evaluation of these net asbestos liabilities. We have included this discharge in our reported adjusted EBITDA.  We currently have receivables on the books related to insurance covering 48% of asbestos liabilities. However, it\u2019s important to note that we have insurance policies with other carriers including Zurich, OneBeacon, and Equita (ph) that we believe provide coverage of asbestos related cost. However, because these carriers are disputing whether or not these policies cover our asbestos cost, we are currently in litigation against them. Although we don\u2019t have any insurance receivables recorded for these policies that have the potential to provide substantial coverage for both our indemnity plans and defence cost. Of course there are no guarantees in litigation. We continue to aggressively pursue solutions to mitigate the company\u2019s financial exposure in this area. Taken together the impact of both the curtailment benefit and the asbestos charge is $5 million unfavorable impact on EBITDA during the quarter.  Now let\u2019s turn to slide 16. For the fourth quarter, total free cash flow was $74 million. This positive result was driven by the impact of receiving $209 million in after tax proceeds from the Eaton settlement. Partially offset by the $134 million prefunding of the next three years of mandatory pensions contributions for our U.S. and UK pension plans. Ignoring the impact of these items, free cash flow for the quarter was roughly breakeven. Slide 17 compares our actual results for fiscal year 2014, to 2013 and the full year guidance we provided during our third quarter earnings call. As you can see, we achieved solid financial performance in 2014. Sales were in line with our most recent guidance and slightly higher than last year. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.3% exceeded the top end of our guidance and was 110 basis points higher than in 2013. Continued execution on our M2016 initiative has allowed us to generate this strong performance and enabled us to overcome headwinds resulting from lower commercial truck production in South America, lower revenue from our defence business, and the loss of earnings from the Suspensys joint venture. Diluted adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75. This full year result represents 143% increase over the prior year and is due to improvements in adjusted EBITDA as well as lower income tax and cash interest expense. Our full year cash flow of $138 million reflects strong conversion of earnings to cash flow and represents our best free cash flow performance since 2006. Overall we are pleased with our financial results this year. Our 8.3% adjusted EBITDA margin performance confirms our belief that we are solidly on track towards achieving our M2016 margin target of 10%. Next I\u2019ll review our fiscal year 2015 outlook on slide 18. Based on the demand assumptions Ike highlighted on slide 9, we expect sales in fiscal year 2015 to be approximately $3.8 billion up slightly from 2014. Although we are expecting the North American Class 8 truck market to strengthen by 5% and we see encouraging signs of recovery in India, most of our other key end markets are expected to see production declines next year.  Despite the relatively flat revenue outlook, we expect to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by 50 to 70 basis points to a range of 8.8% to 9%. We are expecting this margin growth despite both a significant decline in South America productions as well as the $50 million decrease in defence revenue as the SMTD program winds down. We expect to drive this margin growth primarily through continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 for fiscal year 2015. We expect improvements in adjusted EBITDA, combined with lower interest expense and a relatively low effective tax rate to drive an increase year-over-year.  We are also providing our planning assumption for the effective tax rate for 2015 to help you walk from EBITDA down to after tax earnings. As you can see, we expect income tax expense to be approximately 20% of pre-tax income. Remember, in many jurisdictions including the U.S. and most of Western Europe, we previously established evaluation allowances against our net deferred tax assets. As we generate positive earnings in these jurisdictions we will recognize minimal to no tax expense as long as these evaluation allowances exist. The effective tax rate of 20% is indicative of the fact that we expect to start generating earnings in these jurisdictions.  And finally we expect free cash flow to be approximately $100 million for 2015. Due to combination of a stronger balance sheet and continued margin expansion, we expect the company to begin to generate meaningful cash flow. By achieving our M2016 net debt target two years early and by utilizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets we have reduced the amount of EBITDA required to support our fixed cost structure. This has positioned us to convert more of our earnings in to free cash flow this year and in future periods.  Now I will turn the call back over to Ike to provide closing remarks. Ivor J. Evans:  Thanks Kevin. Please turn to slide 19. This year we took actions to majorly improve our EBITDA margin and cash flow. The settlement of our antitrust lawsuit with Eaton and the treasury actions we took during the year enabled us to achieve our net debt target two years early. We have worked hard on customer relationships and demonstrated that with major contract extensions. We told you we were going to improve our execution and we did. As I said we intend to return value to shareholders. In 2015 we will begin our share buyback, this will be the first time since 2008 that we return value directly to shareholders in the form of the dividend or share buyback.  Looking ahead our guidance for this fiscal year shows continued measurable improvement in EBITDA margin and our earnings per share. And we are on track to achieve our M2016 metrics. With that we will take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital :  Yeah, good morning, just wanted a quick housekeeping and operational question and then sort of a balance sheet strategy question. On the quick housekeeping, can you maybe elaborate a bit further on the value added tax accrual. I think what a number of people are trying to get their heads around is was it a more or less a onetime headwind a year ago that showed up in the fourth quarter and what we have now is a cleaner run rate or conversely is this value added tax going to hit at some point in the year and it is just a question of what quarter it gets accrued at? Kevin Nowlan : Hi Brian, it is Kevin. Yes, the value added tax accrual that we booked in the fourth quarter of last year was about $5 million and it was really a onetime item for catch up of some prior period issues that we discovered in our aftermarket business. So we don\u2019t expect that to impact our run rate going forward. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital :  Okay, the second thing is if you look at the original M2016 plan, you had higher revenues than you are coming in at, they are into basis points margin performance. It just looks like as you have said, your margin performance is better than it would have been in the past given where the revenues are actually coming in due to macro. You know what are the two or three big drivers of that and lots of puts and takes around the world, some markets see a word about incremental margins on growth in North America, other managing the detrimental, how is that? Ivor J. Evans: I mean, the first point as it relates to margins on the businesses that we are seeing incremental revenue, actually we are converting nicely on those. So, we are pretty confident as we see revenue upticks in certain markets that we are able to convert in line with our normal expectations.  In terms of our margin performance and where we are seeing improvements that is going above and beyond what even we were guiding to in the last couple of quarters, it really relates to the execution across the board of various M2016 initiatives. It is material performance outperforming our expectations. It is labor and burden performance which had a significant out performance this year relative to the expectations. It is pricing and then again it is converting on the incremental revenue we are seeing in markets that are seeing an uptick in revenue.  So, it is really across the board. And as we look into 2015 and our guidance which implies 50 to 70 basis point increase in margin on relatively flat revenue, it is more of the same. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital :  Okay and then two quick balance sheet questions. First, payment sort of strategy as well, Meritor WABCO JV, that JV seems to be well positioned in some interesting developments with automatic emergency braking, if you have shown up with tuning product where one truck can follow another truck. Is there any -- look at that business though kind of it is right around 38 million down 4 million year-over-year. Is that a business that could actually see some technology driven growth over the next several years or is it just going to continue be dominated by truck builds and the brakes needed on trucks? Ivor J. Evans: No, I think technology is a major play Brian in that regard and so the answer to your question is yes. And I mean we are excited about what we are being able to accomplish with our customers with WABCO. So, no absolutely. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital :  Okay and then\u2026 Ivor J. Evans: It\u2019s a technology play and we\u2019ll see more . Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita : And is there backlog, when you talk about the new business, would that include new business that Meritor WABCO is getting because that\u2019s not consolidated revenue and so how should we think about that? Ivor J. Evans: When we look at our pipeline Brian, we look at our pipeline which by the way we feel really, really good about, that level of business with the joint venture as far as WABCO is not in that. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita : Okay so that\u2019s over and above? Kevin Nowlan : The revenues is not consolidated for Meritor or WABCO so it\u2019s not in our revenue guidance. Obviously performance flows through our JV earnings line and I will say some of the Meritor WABCO sales do got through our aftermarket business so to the extent that we are seeing out performance from a top line perspective within that JV. It does have an impact on our aftermarket business as well but it\u2019s not in a meaningful way from a growth perspective relative to the $500 million revenue growth target. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita : And then final balance sheet question. Now that you\u2019ve delevered a whole bunch, you are ahead of your net debt targets. What are the plans vis-\u00e0-vis cash to repurchase shares, potential timing and magnitude and I guess a broader question kind of should we start looking at this business on EPS as opposed to EBITDA? Kevin Nowlan : Brian as it relates to the plans to repurchase obviously we did come in below our net debt target two years early by about $60 million. Now we do have the mortality table adjustments which have gone into effect and we\u2019ll go into effect for us in 2015. So we have to be cognizant of that. But as we look at that and we look at our expected cash flow generation, we are confident that we are going to start the execution of that buyback program this year in 2015 and complete the execution of that program by the end of fiscal 2016. As it relates to thinking about us more on an EPS basis, I think we are thinking about that more internally as well and there is a couple of reasons for that. One of the important reasons is because as we buy back shares, you know, we are trying to deliver real value to shareholder that manifest itself in the EPS line item. Second, I think what you see is we are starting to generate a real benefit on these deferred tax balances that have valuation allowances against them, we\u2019re going to see relatively low effective tax rates for the coming years as you see in our 20% effective tax rate guidance of planning assumption. And that\u2019s not reflected in EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA margins but obviously that flows through the benefit -- the benefit of that flows through EPS. So as we think about our performance we are spending a lot more time thinking about EPS as well. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita : And does your EPS guidance for 2015 include buybacks? Kevin Nowlan : It does not so that\u2019s potential upside depending on the timing and the magnitude. Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita : Okay, thanks and great progress on -- and we should call it M2014 at this point? Ivor J. Evans: Thank you Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky of Sidoti & Company. Please proceed. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Hi, good morning. How are you doing? Ivor J. Evans: Good morning. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: I was wondering if you can give us maybe quantify what the revenue decline was from South America in defence or perhaps the EBITDA decline just to get a better sense of how much mix went against you in commercial? Kevin Nowlan : On a year-over-year basis full year, I mean the full year basis its almost $140 million of decline between the two businesses. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: 40 million in full year, what was that in the fourth quarter? Kevin Nowlan : $140 million for the full year both South America and defence combined. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and as far as the quarter specifically can we just divide that by 4 for kind of a rough approximation maybe a little bit less than that because of the cadence of the draw down on defense? Kevin Nowlan : I would tell you it was in the zip code of $35 million to $40 million down sequentially. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and then \u2013 Kevin Nowlan : For the quarter year-over-year, the one quarter year-over-year. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Yes, in the fourth quarter versus last year? Kevin Nowlan : Fourth quarter versus last year ballpark is $35 million to $40 million. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and then I know there\u2019s a lot noise in SG&A so should we look at $75 million as a more realistic or reasonable number for what fourth quarter SG&A would have been? Kevin Nowlan : I think the way what we have seen is pretty consistently the last few quarters running in around 6.5% to 7% more normalized, is what we are seeing. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and then finally one other the question just on the deferred tax assets that you have, how much profitability are you going to be generating in I guess the jurisdictions that you haven\u2019t been paying taxes in previously, is it going to be pretty meaningful and I am wondering how long those deferred tax assets will take to get exhausted over the next forecast that you see in your profitability standpoints? Just trying to get a better sense of what the value is of that asset from where you are right now given the improvement of operations in those jurisdictions? Kevin Nowlan : You\u2019ll be able to see when you look at our 10-K what those deferred tax assets balances are. In terms of generating real profit in those jurisdictions we expect to start generating profit in the bulk of U.S. and Western Europe in 2015, which is the reason you are seeing an effective rate that\u2019s 20% as opposed to something that looks like a U.S. statutory rate of 35%. So, as you think about our earnings performance going forward that 20% effective rate is reflective of the fact that we are getting 0% tax rate on those earnings. As we look forward we have a substantial pipeline of these deferred tax assets, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. So it will take a long-long time to exhaust. Now what we do have is the potential that if we generate earnings in these jurisdictions for the next two to three years consistently and have a forecast that will continue to generate earnings in those jurisdictions, the potential exist that we would reverse the valuation allowance at some point in the future and put those assets back on the book. Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then I guess is there any way you can guide us as to how much profitability you will be making in those regions or is that detail you don\u2019t want to disclose? Kevin Nowlan : At this point we are not disclosing that but I think you can get a sense based on the fact that it\u2019s a 20% effective rate and that a normal tax rate probably looks like something closer to 30% or 35% Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Alright, thank you very much, good luck. Ivor J. Evans: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnappple of Longbow Research. Please proceed. Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research : Hi, good morning guys and congrats on a nice quarter. Ivor J. Evans: Well, thank you. Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research : Ike, I believe you mentioned last quarter that your capacity is around 300,000 unit North American market, but it looks now based on continued strength in orders that builds could certainly be higher than at level on 2015, I know your guidance I think suggest 290 to 300 so, how should we think about your ability and plans to meet demand if higher than previously expected gross scenario plays out next year? Ivor J. Evans: You are right. We have stated that our capacity is at around that 300,000 unit level Neil. As discussed the production demand and the capacity levels of our customers, and we do this just on almost a daily basis, we really think the industry is at 290,000 to 300,000 market level. So the way we would view this is that the backlog which is by the way is increasing each month along with the strong Class 8 orders for October, we really think it bodes well for us in the second half of our fiscal year. Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research : Okay, so you are not worried about missing out on some upside in demand potentially if the market were to heat up a bit more than expected? Ivor J. Evans: Not really, we really think the market really is around that 300,000 level. Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research : Alright and then can you remind us of how lower steel prices will impact Meritor, I believe you guys have steel pricing adjustment programs in place of most of your major OEM manufacturers but you just remind us what the lag is and what percent of pass through you are allowed on average? Kevin Nowlan : We do have pass through mechanisms with the bulk of our OE customers as it relates to steel prices, whether steel prices go up or down we tend to have movements that go along with movements in steel industries. Those tend to lag the actual movements and the changes in our cost by upwards is six to nine months. Now what I will tell you though is what we see in the last six months or so steel has been relatively flat across the globe particularly if you t North America and Europe. So we haven\u2019t seen material movements in steel or something. Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research : Alright and one last one, I think you mentioned earlier Ike that you guys are still confident you can achieve the 500 million of incremental booked revenue. Could you elaborate on any potential opportunities on the horizon if the target is predicated on you guys, getting a major military contract by JLTB? Thank you. Ivor J. Evans: No, the pipeline is quite robust and we\u2019re very confident that we think we can deliver that number. And as we have said before it\u2019s really not dependent upon any single program to make that happen. So I mean at this point in time I mean we are still very, very bullish about what our abilities to make that 250 million hidden in 2016 and $500 million run rate. Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan - UBS: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Any color on the aftermarket trailer margin in terms of how sustainable that is. It looks like a record margin. You kind of indicated that the tax issue is more of a onetime issue last year, how should we think about that going forward? Kevin Nowlan : Hi Colin, this is Kevin. Keep in mind that the aftermarket in trailer is benefitting now from the fact that we have recast Mascot discontinued operations. So that did help as we recast the earnings for each of the quarters including the fourth quarter this year. As you look at that 14 plus percent margin in Q4 relative to what you might think of as a run rate, it is probably a little bit high because we have some of those yearend liability valuation adjustments I talked about, product liability workers comp. Those things had a little bit more of an impact on the aftermarket and trailer segment. So probably upwards of a point that, that 14% might be high relative to what you might think of as a run rate going forward, at the type of revenue level that they generated in the fourth quarter. But still a pretty high margin relative to historic standards as we jump off. Colin Langan - UBS: And how much you mentioned Mascot, how much of a drag historically has that been in the business? Kevin Nowlan : I can tell you in 2014 for instance there was about $29 million of revenue from the business and we generated a loss of about $5 million of operating losses in the business. So that gives you a sense as to what\u2019s been recast out for the full year of the aftermarket in trailer segment. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay and any thoughts on, you mentioned pension mortality assumptions, is that impacting you this year or is that an issue for next year? Kevin Nowlan : It will be an issue this year in 2015. I think a couple of weeks ago or few weeks ago the final rules were handed down and so the expectation is that the actuaries for the plans across North America, the actuaries will be using those new mortality tables with some discretion as they have they update valuations for companies at year end. Colin Langan - UBS: And any sense of how big of a factor that or measurements going to be? Kevin Nowlan : Well we estimated it previously about six months ago as being about $124 million negative impact or increase in the liability for our pension and our OPEB liabilities. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay and just one last one, on the buyback I mean what is the authorization, is it still 210 million and how should we think about that over the next two years, if you think about that going equally over that period or will it be lumping or how should we think? Kevin Nowlan : At this point we are not giving specific guidance or timing on other than to say that we are going to commence the execution of that buyback plan this year, and we\u2019ll complete it by the end of 2016. But we are not going to give any more details of that. You know, the things we are looking at is where we stand relative to our net debt target adjusted for the mortality tables, where free cash flow is coming in, what our liquidity requirements are of being compliant with compliance with our covenants. But at the end of the day we are going to execute the full 210 within the next two fiscal years. And that 210 has been approved by the board and we have the flexibility under our revolving credit agreement to be able to execute on that as well. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay, thank you very much and congrats on a good quarter. Ivor J. Evans: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Kanowski (ph) of JP Morgan. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. How are you doing, this is David Kanowski on for Ryan. Ivor J. Evans: Good morning David. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning guys. Just a question on your margin guidance, it seems to imply a little bit more of a step up in 2016 and in 2015, can you just talk about what may be drives some of that strength into the out year, is that just some of the headwinds from SMTD still showing up in 2015? Kevin Nowlan : Well keep in mind as we look ahead to 2016 what we said as we expect to be able to achieve 10% EBITDA margin in 2016 as long as revenue is above $4.2 billion. And so part of our expectation is we are going to continue to see execution of material performance, labor and burden performance, pricing actions but we also expecting to still see some market improvement and revenue improvement, a piece of which is market and a piece of which is achieving the $250 million of new business wins that will materialize over the course of the next two years. So we are expecting revenue to be a piece of the equation in converting on that incremental revenue. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and can you just also maybe remind us what your revenue exposure is in China right now and maybe provide a little bit color on the environment and what\u2019s driving some of that uncertainty you mentioned in the slide deck? Ivor J. Evans: Our revenues in the $150 million range and right now we see the market up slightly which was good. But I mean there is a lot of uncertainty as you know around China but it\u2019s not a large market for us in that sense. So the uncertainty still persists but it\u2019s around $150 million David. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and then just one last question, can you just remind us maybe what you expect to pay in pension contributions that is here for 2015 and 2016, I think this would be your pay as you go plans? Kevin Nowlan : It will be roughly about $10 million. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, alright, thanks a lot guys. Ivor J. Evans: Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no additional questions in the queue and I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Please proceed. Carl Anderson : Thank you.

Ike Evans : Thank you, Carl, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 for a look and highlights from the first quarter. We\u2019re pleased to report continued earnings momentum as you can see in our first quarter results. Year-over-year, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points to 9% despite lower revenue. Incremental pricing as well as continued benefits material, labor and burden performance favorably impacted earnings. As strong demand continues in the North American Class 8 truck market, our focus on converting the incremental sales at our targeted contribution rate to management of our operating and product cost is showing in our results. We are also very excited to announce a new long-term contract with PACCAR. I\u2019ll give you more specifics about this new business win on the next slide. As we continue to deliver strong results, the confirms are confidence in achieving the three overriding objectives of our M2016 initiative. First, with the performance we are delivering in the first quarter of 2015, our margin is now within 100% basis points over 2016 objective of 10%. Second, we\u2019ve generated significant cash flows over the last couple of years from operations, the litigation and the sale of the non-core business, that has allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly $500 million in just two years. And finally, we continue to drive new business wins, including the execution of the PACCAR agreement that I just mentioned, but it goes far beyond the PACCAR win. Over the past several quarters, we\u2019ve told you about several other new business wins and long-term contracts with major OEs, including Volvo, Daimler, MAN, Ashley Cleveland, [ph] Hino, and Scania and others. We are growing our relationships with major global truck manufacturers around the world. The book of business we are building is strong, and reinforces the competitive differentiators that make Meritor unique. Our Board of Directors continues to evolve and strengthen, most recently with the addition of Lloyd Trotter, who is elected to Meritor\u2019s Board this month. Lloyd had a successful 36-year career at GE during which time he held roles as Vice Chairman, President and CEO of GE Industrial, and Vice President of GE Manufacturing Operations. He is also a Founding Member of GenNx360 Capital Partners, a private equity firm, based in New York, that focuses on improving business operations to drive shareholder value. Lloyd\u2019s operational background and experience in private equity will be a tremendous asset to our Board, as we manage the company for greater shareholder return. Let\u2019s go to Slide 4 for a more detail on our new seven-year agreement with PACCAR, a global market leader in design and manufacturer of premium trucks. If you remember that about a year ago, we announced new business with DAF in South America, at the time, we viewed this as an important step in broadening our relationship with PACCAR. And now we are announcing a new long-term agreement with PACCAR. Under this agreement, Meritor will now have preferred product positioning for rear axles in North America and Australia. And in those regions, we also have enhanced optional positioning for brakes, drivelines, and front axles. As we ramp up production with PACCAR over the next couple of years, we expect this to resolve an incremental revenue of more than $150 million for our company. The bulk of this income revenue will come after 2015, although we will see some step up this year. In anticipation of this significant opportunity, we\u2019ve been executing a modest capacity strategy over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve also worked to mitigate supply constraints and implemented various operational improvements that have increased throughput in our plans. As a result, we have capacity available to support this incremental PACCAR business while still meeting our contractual commitments with all of our other customers. We expect this additional capacity, which began to come online during 2014, will allow us to effectively service our customer base at around 300,000 Class 8 market, once you factor in anticipated share increases with PACCAR over the next couple of years. This agreement with PACCAR provides opportunities for us to grow with this global truck manufacturer as we expand future product plans. It\u2019s an important new relationship for us with DAF and other premier truck manufacturers. We\u2019ve worked hard to earn this business and look forward to growing it successfully. At Meritor, we are differentiating ourselves from our competitors and expanding our global customer relationships. We are doing this with a global engineering network with a tremendously talent team of commercial vehicle experts. Manufacturing capabilities around the world are efficient, advanced, and unique, a global footprint that allows us to serve our customers efficiently and timely and hands down the best customer service and support in the industry. But we can always be better, and despite the significant improvements that we made in execution, safety, quality, and delivery, we want to keep getting better. However, customers require excellence of us and we require excellence of ourselves. Please turn to Slide 5 for a wide fiscal year 2015 market outlook. Let\u2019s take a look at North America. We believe the strength in order activity reflected most recently in December orders is a result of converging trends, including stronger economic activity, aging fleets, fuel economy, and solid fleet profitability. Indications are that the fleets have accelerated orders for 2015 requirements to reserve their places from future deliveries. Based on these factors and what we see in OE forecasted line rates, we expect the current backlog to drive strong levels of production throughout 2015 and into the beginning of 2016 as well. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for Class 8 volumes in this region by close to 5% to a range of 305,000 to 315,000. However, we are not anticipating to see a comparable pickup in our production. Daimler Truck North America has ramped up manufacturing of its Detroit axle to support its incremental demand in this peak market. While we currently are and expect to remain the majority supplier of Class 8 axles to DTNA, Detroit is producing more of its own axle to support the current cycle and heads up setting the upside opportunity arising from our increased Class 8 market outlook. As I mentioned, our new business with PACCAR in North America has begun. We will see a modest impact in this fiscal year with the bulk of the increase coming in 2016 and 2017. In other markets, Europe remains flat from our last forecast at a midpoint of 390,000 units. Economic indicators continue the fluctuating, making it difficult to forecast the timing of improvement in this region. However, we do expect currency headwinds to persist for the rest of the year, as the euro continues to depreciate versus the dollar. In South America, we have decreased our production outlook approximately 10% due to a difficult economic climate, driven by high inflation and climbing interest rates. That means that year-over-year we expect the market to be down 20%. The Brazilian currency has also weakened considerably, which is having a negative effect on revenue as well. Changes were also made for 2015 that affect the financing mechanism used for more than 70% of the truck and bus purchases in the region. Companies will now be required to make a down payment as much as 50% and the financing period is being shortened by several years. We anticipate that these changes in the financing structure of truck purchases will place further pressure on our business in Brazil. As a result, we continue to manage our cost structure appropriately. We believe that all of these incremental headwinds will drive slightly lower revenue this year. from: Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6, please. As I mentioned, our execution is showing in our results. Year-over-year, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin to 9% driven by pricing, labor and burden improvements, and material performance, all actions that identified a part of M2016 and we achieved this on slightly lower sales. We are confident in our ability to achieve our margin target of 10% for 2016, even though we are anticipating less help from the global market recovery than we did when we launched M2016. Our self-help strategy is working as you can see in year-over-year and sequential comparisons. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Kevin for financial details. Kevin Nowlan : you: As a result, we generated adjusted EBITDA margin of 9% and $35 million of adjusted income from continuing operations in the first quarter. Both of these are good results for us. So let\u2019s walk through the detail by first turning to Slide 7, where you will see our first quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $879 million in the quarter, down $21 million, or 2% year-over-year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower commercial truck production in Europe and South America, as well as lower revenue from our defense business. Sales were also negatively impacted by $30 million in the quarter, due to the weaker euro and Brazilian real. The decrease in sales was partially offset by higher sales in North America, as the Class 8 tuck market continue to strengthen. Gross margin increased $10 million year-over-year due to pricing and material labor and burden performance. Keep in mind that this increase in gross margin was achieved despite the year-over-year step down in revenue. SG&A was $6 million higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily due to a $5 million long-term disability accrual reduction, which occurred last year and did not repeat. Interest expense was $19 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $27 million in the same period last year. The decrease was driven by the capital market transactions we executed that reduced our gross debt balances by $171 million and lowered our cost of debt. In addition, interest expense was favorably impacted by $2 million, due to interest earned on the refund of a judicial deposit in Brazil, which will not repeat going forward. Income tax expense was $7 million in the first quarter of 2015, representing a decrease of $4 million compared to the prior year, despite the fact that pre-tax income was higher this year. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter call, in many jurisdictions, including the U.S. and most of Western Europe, we previously established valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. As we generate positive earnings in these jurisdictions, we will recognize the minimal tax expense as long as these valuation allowances exist. Our effective tax rate of approximately 18% this quarter is a reflection of the fact that we are beginning to generate earnings in certain of these jurisdictions. All of that totals up to adjusted income from continuing operations of $35 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Slide 8 shows first quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck and industrial. Sales were $703 million, down $24 million, or 3% from the same period last year. In Europe, the Euro 6 pre-buy favorably impacted sales a year ago. In addition, we saw lower production in South America in defense and experienced approximately $30 million of FX headwinds in the segment, due to the weakening euro and Brazilian real. These revenue headwinds were partially offset by higher sales in North America, as the Class 8 truck market continue to strengthen. Segment EBITDA was $56 million, an increase of $3 million year-over-year. Continued execution of M2016 initiatives, including pricing and reduced product in operating costs, as well as the conversion on higher sales in North America more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower defense revenue, lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and FX. Next on Slide 9, we\u2019ve summarized the Aftermarket and Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $208 million, up $6 million from last year, mostly coming from our aftermarket and trailer businesses in North America. Segment EBITDA was $25 million, up $4 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by conversion on the slightly higher sales and pricing actions executed last year. Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 10, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk starting from the $80 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2014. First, you will recall that last quarter, we incurred both the $20 million charge associated with the remeasurement of our asbestos liabilities and the $15 million benefit related to the curtailment of our U.S. retiree medical plan at year end. Both of these items were discreet to the fourth quarter and did not repeat. The net impact of volume mix and pricing was flat for the quarter, even though volumes were down significantly on a sequential basis. Our first fiscal quarter has selling days, which affects our aftermarket business. In addition, production levels were down in South America as that market continues to show further signs of softening and the bid in North America as well as industry production was a little lower than in Q4. We were able to offset the lower volume through global pricing. Next, we experienced $23 million foreign currency headwind on sales, which negatively impacted EBITDA by $5 million, primarily associated with the continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the real. Finally, we had an all other net decrease in EBITDA of $1 million. This includes around $3 million of one-time favorable items that provided the benefit to our result this quarter. Overall, this was a very solid quarter for us. Despite declining revenue, our strong execution presented a corresponding decline in adjusted EBITDA. The result was adjusted EBITDA of $79 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 9%, which means, we were able to successfully manage downside conversion to only 2%. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11. For the first quarter, total free cash flow was negative $21 million, compared to negative $16 million in the prior year. In the first quarter, we typically make our variable incentive compensation payments related to prior year performance, and this year\u2019s payments were higher than the prior year\u2019s payments. These payments are included in the line item called other on the slide. Aside from incentive compensation payments, our first quarter is also typically affected by seasonal trends, including fewer selling days and calendar year-end cut off issues which often impact the timing of receivables collections. Despite this, we continue to be on track to generate $100 million in cash flow this year. Next, I\u2019ll review our updated fiscal year 2015 outlook on Slide 12. Based on the demand assumptions I highlighted on Slide 5, we have lowered our fiscal year 2015 sales guidance to approximately $3.7 billion. As noted on that earlier slide, we are seeing FX headwinds in Brazil and Europe, which is impacting our revenue outlook. You can see our new currency assumptions reflected on the slide here. In addition, lower production expectations in South America and China are further reducing our revenue expectations. And while the North America Class 8 market is up a bit, as we mentioned, we don\u2019t expect to see that translate to increased revenue for us, as the increased revenue opportunity is being offset by DTNA supporting that ramp-up with increased internal axle production. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 9% compared to our previous guidance of a range of 8.8% to 9%. We expect to drive this margin result primarily through our continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives. We\u2019re maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance from continuing operations in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 for fiscal year 2015. The impact of lower revenue, slightly higher margin guidance, and the mix of earnings between tax-paying and non-tax-paying jurisdictions is driving very little impact on our bottom line earnings outlook. Our effective income tax rate guidance also remains unchanged at approximately 20% for fiscal year 2015. Although cash taxes might drop a bit with the revised mix of earnings, that drop isn\u2019t going to move the needle meaningfully on our effective tax rate. And finally, as I said earlier, we continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $100 million for 2015, which means, we\u2019re expecting back to back years of cash flow at or above that level. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ike, to provide closing remarks. Ike Evans : Thanks, Kevin. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 13. Before we conclude our comments, I want to reiterate that we are on track to achieve all three of our M2016 metrics. By the end of fiscal 2014, we had already reduced net debt, including retirement benefit liabilities by close to $500 million, achieving our target two years early. Despite the revenue headwinds we referenced today, primarily in Europe and South America, we remain confident in achieving our 10% adjusted EBITDA margin target in 2016. And we remain on track to achieve incremental book revenue of $500 million per year at run rate. In fact, with the PACCAR win we announced today, we\u2019re more than halfway to achieving our $500 million run rate revenue target. We\u2019ll share more detail on our performance against these goals next week at Analyst Day. And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed. Brian Johnson : Good morning, team. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning. Ike Evans : Good morning, Brian. Brian Johnson : Look forward to seeing you next week. I want to just get a little bit more color on PACCAR. Could you maybe tell us if I or a fleet buyer is going to a PACCAR showroom earlier this calendar year, what would I be offered in terms of rear axles and other drivetrains? Where would Meritor have been in that option book, if at all, and then where are you going forward? And then kind of second, leading into that, is that $150 million in annual run rate, life of the contract measure and so forth? Ike Evans : If you were to walk in and talk to a fleet, you would find that the Meritor axel would be listed as the preferred axel. And the 100 - to answer your other question on the revenue, that\u2019s a $150 million annually. Brian Johnson : Okay. But earlier in the year, if I went in last year to a fleet, would I even have the option\u2026? Ike Evans : You would have the - Brian you would have had the option, but our competitor would have been listed as standard. Brian Johnson : Okay. So you are moving from standard from optional to preferred for rear axle\u2026 Kevin Nowlan : Yes, let me - yes, Brian, at that point, I mean, there are specific axles that we\u2019re talking about. And in particular as we talk about the preferred option, we\u2019re really talking about a 46K axle, and there - there\u2019s technically not a real standard position in the data book. The standard positions are around the 40K axles. And so, as you look at the 46K axle, which is a meaningful piece of the business, the rear axle business, we are the preferred option, which means, we are lower priced in the data book this year going forward. Brian Johnson : And what do you think was going on - why do you think you won this business, how competitive was it? What was the feedback from the customer on why they made this change? Ike Evans : The feedback from PACCAR and you need to ask them specifically, but they view us as a long-term partner, they can support them from a product, quality, and delivery standpoint. And matter of fact, at the Analyst Day, you will see Jay Craig is with Bob Christensen, and you will see a testimonial almost from Bob Christensen talking about why they picked us. Brian Johnson : And in terms of capacity, is it - how are you freeing up capacity, is it adding extra shifts, is it improving flow rates through Six Sigma, any bump outs? Ike Evans : It\u2019s all of that. We have had some capital investment. It\u2019s been modest and it\u2019s been within the 2% that we\u2019ve targeted. And there is still some, a little bit of modest, it\u2019s not much to go that will finish this year. We\u2019ve really as far as our operational excellence, we\u2019ve been working on quality throughput and then had some real opportunities there. And we\u2019ve also worked with our supply place to mitigate the constraints there. So if you look at it from a standpoint of our guidance this year of 305 to 315, we will - we\u2019ve stated we were at 300, we probably can support, because we had two 80,000 quarters that we have successfully converted that would take us to 320, but when PACCAR was fully up to speed we would be back to a 300 Class 8 market. Brian Johnson : Okay. And this trend with Detroit Diesel - last question, kind of, how much of an offset is insourcing to the market share gains you are making in PACCAR and is this more of a - is this permanent shift at that customer, or could it happen with other customers, or is it more a question of a customer, kind of, adding peak loading capacity? Ike Evans : Right, we\u2019ve seen Detroit ramp up to support this peak market, and it has had the effect that we\u2019re talking about. But they are a valued and important customer. They are our largest customer in North America. I mean, we just signed a long-term agreement with DTNA last year that runs through 2017. And the bottom line is that, they and we expect to remain the majority supplier of their Class 8 axles going forward. Brian Johnson : Okay, great. Thank you. Looking forward to seeing you next week. Ike Evans : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan : Yes, just - thanks for taking my questions. Can you just clarify in terms of, I think you mentioned that you are preferred on certain axles, so any color in terms of the PACCAR business. Are you preferred in the majority of the trucks that they are selling, or is this just a subset and any color there on the relative size\u2026? Ike Evans : The preferred option is really focused on the 46K, which is, it\u2019s not the majority of the business, but it\u2019s a meaningful piece of the business. Colin Langan : Okay. Thank you for the clarification. Any color on how we should think about the rest of the year? If we look at the annualized pace, you are at around $1.40, but you didn\u2019t take your guidance up. What factors kind of mitigate the earnings growth through the rest of the year that we should be thinking about as we model things out? Kevin Nowlan : I mean one of the things to keep in mind is that, as I mentioned in my remarks on the sequential walk, there was about $3 million of, I\u2019ll call them one-time favorable items just a few $1 million items that we don\u2019t expect to repeat. So if you flowed that through the EPS, if you backed that out effectively on a going forward basis, your annualized run rate wouldn\u2019t be as high as what you\u2019re suggesting there. So I think that\u2019s something to keep in mind. Colin Langan : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And any color on - this is the first quarter with the new Volvo contract, any color now that has sort of passed on how much that maybe helped in the new contract or any framework there? Ike Evans : We can\u2019t really comment on that. We did get pricing with our OEs across all regions as well as our aftermarket business as well. But really not in a position disclosed specific details about that contract I would reiterate again that, we\u2019re really pleased that we\u2019re able to reach the agreement with Volvo that allows us to continue to provide them with their products for the foreseeable future. Colin Langan : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick Archambault : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I guess just - I dialed in a bit late and I might have missed the detail, but just the interplay between kind of the ramp-up for DTNA that you mentioned as well as PACCAR, and I guess the impact on margins that it\u2019s having. Could you just get kind of get into a little bit more detail on that just because I felt we went through it fast, I wasn\u2019t quite sure of what the impact was of all those pieces put together. Kevin Nowlan : Okay, Patrick, I\u2019ll - this is Kevin, I\u2019ll take that. Very simply the way to think about it is that we\u2019ve taken our full-year North American truck market up - guidance up about 5%. We think that 5% increase in market is effectively being offset from a revenue perspective by DTNA ramping up its internal production to support the peak market. So I think we are seeing effectively that upset opportunity being offset by some of the ramp up the DTNA has done. In terms of the PACCAR business, the bulk of the PACCAR ramp-up is going to happen after 2015, it will happen in 2016 and 2017. We are seeing some of that ramp-up this year, but it\u2019s already factored into the guidance. We were on the verge of executing this contract back when we first gave guidance for the full-year, so we were already contemplating that in the guidance. Patrick Archambault : And I\u2019m sorry, like the DTNA ramping up internally that would be negative for you, why exactly? Kevin Nowlan : Because effectively they are ramping up internal axle production, so they have a vertically integrated supplier. We provide the majority of the Class 8 axles and we continue to do so today, but they ramped up such that effectively our penetration on the rear axles with them has gone down as a result. Patrick Archambault : And is that just kind of a timing item, or is that sort of a permanent shift that they\u2019ve kind of resourced some of the stuff you have had? Ike Evans : Patrick, we just signed just last year a four-year agreement and with Daimler that positions us as a majority of - supplier for the majority of their axles, and we expect that to be the case going forward as well. Patrick Archambault : Okay. But - sorry, just a little bit on this more though, it sounds like in exchange for a price, they might have insourced some of it, right? Is that kind of a fair way to think about it? Ike Evans : No. Kevin Nowlan : I don\u2019t know that I would go that far, Patrick, other than to say, we\u2019ve seen them clearly ramp-up their internal axle production capability to support the peak market here. And beyond that that\u2019s probably all I would say at the moment, but we expect to continue to provide the majority of axles as we\u2019re doing today on the Class 8 business. Patrick Archambault : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And just on Brazil, did you - did I hear you say that your - I don\u2019t have the comps of the South American numbers you have on page 5 or Slide 5, but did I - I think you had said that was down 20%, so that\u2019s fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014, is that correct? And then, I guess, maybe just a little bit more on that, I get it that you have the FINAME financing rates that have gone up in the down payment and all of that fun stuff. But I mean, on a calendar basis, production was down 50% in Brazil or the high 40s% at least last year. So one would have thought it was at least an easy comp. So I guess, maybe, just help me understand a little bit better what\u2019s going on there, if you don\u2019t mind. Kevin Nowlan : Well, on a year-over-year basis, 2014 production was down only about 12% in 2014 versus 2013. As we look ahead to this year, we\u2019re expecting it to be down another 20% on top of that. I mean, if you look at Q1 alone, sequentially going from Q4 to Q1 the market is down - production is down over 20%. You look on a year-over-year basis 2014 to 2015 is down little over 30%. The market we\u2019re seeing right now in Brazil, where we are looking at about 130,000 market is approaching the levels that we saw back in 2009. The good news is, we\u2019re still profitable in that market and we expect to play in that business longer-term. But we\u2019re approaching levels that we haven\u2019t seen since the recession five or six years ago. Patrick Archambault : Interesting. I guess, maybe, some of that is the fiscal conversion, and I suppose you also potentially have a different market than what ANFAVEA reports, is that the difference? Because on a calendar basis, they have production down, kind of high 40s%, but so - maybe we can take that offline, but\u2026 Kevin Nowlan : Yes, we can talk about that offline, but ANFAVEA we\u2019re looking at from them that we\u2019re seeing the exact same numbers that they are. Patrick Archambault : Okay. All right. We will reconcile that offline. Thanks a lot, guys. Kevin Nowlan : Okay. Ike Evans : Thank you, Patrick. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed. Brett Hoselton : Good morning, gentlemen. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning. Ike Evans : Good morning, Brett. Brett Hoselton : I guess first, just kind of a broad kind of overarching question here. Over the past 10 or 15 years that I have covered the company, you guys have gone through a number of cycles. As that cycle has ramped up and we\u2019ve seen a fairly material ramp-up in Class 8 orders here recently and obviously you are raising your expectations here. In the past the leverage that a lot of us anticipated you might get or benefit from as a result of the higher sales has been offset by premium freight costs over time and that sort of thing, and therefore, you haven\u2019t necessarily gotten to the 10% target that you had hoped to achieve and so forth. So my question is, how do you think about or how have things changed at Meritor this cycle versus prior cycles that that give you confidence that you will be able to achieve these higher margins as that cycle lifts? Ike Evans : We\u2019ll, I think, we\u2019ve given guidance before that we thought we could convert incremental revenue in the 15% to 20% range. And I think the answer Brett, is we\u2019ve been doing it. We have just come out two 80,000 quarters. And we did successfully convert at the 15% to 20%. Now, some of it has been better throughput as we talked about before and we\u2019ve expanded our supply base. There has been - it\u2019s not a single one action, it\u2019s probably 10 or 15, if you were to sit and list them all. But I think the proof is proof is, is in the pudding of what we\u2019ve been doing, that we\u2019ve successfully been doing it for the last four, five quarters. Brett Hoselton : And then as you think about the additional 100 basis points of margin expansion as you move into 2016, can you talk about or quantify or bucket the primary drivers of that and then just kind of give us a flavor of your confidence level in being able to achieve that? Kevin Nowlan : And I think as we look ahead to 2016, we are emboldened by the fact that we are already jumping out of the gate here in the first quarter of 2015 at 9% on revenue that\u2019s not even at $900 million. So we feel pretty good about the starting point as we look ahead toward 2016. So as we look towards 2016, we are expecting a mix of continued performance like we\u2019ve been demonstrating the last couple of years combined with some revenue help. I mean, at the end of the day, we have a mix of things that we are looking for next year. And as we said publicly, we expect that we need to be at about $4.2 billion of revenue to be able to achieve 10% target. Now jumping off of $3.7 billion, how do you get from $3.7 billion to $4.2 billion? It\u2019s too early to call what the markets are going to look like next year. But we know that with the new business wins that we generated, including the PACCAR win that we announced here today, that\u2019s going to contribute a couple of $100 million incrementally between 2015 and 2016, which means then end market recovery we are still looking for $300 million or so of help. That said, this company is determined on executing toward hitting its 10% margin targets, but that\u2019s kind of the flight path there. Ike Evans : I think to add a little more to that, it\u2019s basically our self-help. In 2016, the elegance of it is in its simplicity and the focus that we\u2019ve done around the initiatives to support the overarching objectives. Brett Hoselton : The 80,000 unit run rate that you experienced here, about 320,000 units, what happens in the event that the market moves up maybe another 10% or so to north of 350,000 units? How does that affect the business model, the margin profile, and so forth? Ike Evans : Right now, we don\u2019t think that is probably the case, Brett, and we\u2019re in a position where we are supporting our contractual agreements with our customers. So I mean, I don\u2019t see the market for the foreseeable future doing that. But right now, we are not going to chase capacity around the world above and beyond what we\u2019ve committed to. Kevin Nowlan : And I think when we look back to the last time we were approaching these types of levels in 2012, we saw or observed that there were constraints across the global supply base. And so seeing the market get to that type of level like you mentioned, 350,000, I don\u2019t think we think it\u2019s really achievable given the broader supply base in this industry. And so, as Ike mentioned, we are not going to chase that capacity by investing - installing new capacity to support that. But we don\u2019t see the market going there. We think the order activity we are seeing, frankly, just strengthens our outlook for 2015 and probably carries us into 2016 as well a little bit. Brett Hoselton : Excellent. Ike, Kevin, thank you very much, gentlemen. Ike Evans : Thank you. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Robert Kosowsky from Sidoti. Please proceed. Robert Kosowsky : Good morning, guys how are you doing? Ike Evans : How are you, Robert. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning, Robert. Robert Kosowsky : Doing, right. Just going back to the Detroit axle, DTNA, I guess, shift in production, is this something that was contemplated when you came up with the most recent agreement? Meaning that if they are ramping up production right now, it might be tacking into some inefficiencies that you might have in your own production environment. So this is something that was contemplated going into that agreement a couple of years ago? Ike Evans : I can\u2019t necessarily answer what DTNA was thinking at the time. I just know what we\u2019ve agreed to in the contract. And it was just signed last year, and the contract is that, we will be the majority supplier of DTNA\u2019s axles going forward. Kevin Nowlan : So, I mean, it\u2019s is structured in a way that it gives DTNA the incentive to keep business with us. But DTNA has had that - had their vertical capability for an extended period of time that we continue to be the majority supplier of axles for an extended period of time. So the way the agreement is structured, our expectation of that relationship is that, it will continue to be operate the way it has, which is we will be the majority supplier. But, again, I think DTNA has used this as an opportunity to invest in some capacity from the axle side to support the peak market here. Ike Evans : The way Kevin explained it, we are just missing a little bit of the upside here, that\u2019s the bottom line. Robert Kosowsky : Okay. And would this - if you had gotten this upside, would you have incurred, I guess, inefficiencies because it would have been - the market would have been going above what you were, I guess, capacitized for? Kevin Nowlan : We don\u2019t think so because, in fact, as we - as Ike talked about earlier, the capacity that we were installing over the last couple of years to support the PACCAR business that we were anticipating winning and ramping up. That capacity really started to come online last year. And so it happened to coincide with this type of the market, which is why we were able to actually support the 80,000 quarter that we saw back in Q4. And so, as the market hit that type of level with the types of penetrations we\u2019ve experienced in the past with DTNA, we absolutely could have supported it. Now, once the PACCAR business comes fully up to speed over the next couple of years, our capacity will be constrained back to the levels that it was before. So I think the fact is, we could support an 80,000 market right now, because the capacity is there to support it until the PACCAR business completely ramps up. Robert Kosowsky : Okay, I understand that. And then secondly, obviously there is weakness in Brazil and China on the construction side. I\u2019m wondering do you see any signs of hope in those markets, and specifically there was some talk earlier this month about a Chinese infrastructure stimulus plan coming out. Do you give any credence to that? Ike Evans : Well, the Brazilian market is - obviously has its own issues, and we don\u2019t see much recovery this year. Hopefully we\u2019ll start to see some recovery next year, and as Kevin implied, we like the Brazilian market. We have strong relationships with our customers. We are profitable at the levels that it is today, so I mean, we\u2019re very much committed to the Brazilian market. The China market is anybody\u2019s guess, and if - obviously if there is additional infrastructure spending, we\u2019ll obviously have the opportunity to take advantage of that. Robert Kosowsky : Okay. Do you think there is a good likelihood that a plan goes through, or do you have any kind of idea as to whether or not the reality of that happening? Ike Evans : I just don\u2019t know, to be honest. Robert Kosowsky : All right. Thank you very much, and good luck. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Alex Potter : Hi, guys. One thing that you had mentioned pretty consistently both in the aftermarket and in the new equipment segment was this impact on pricing. Can you just, I guess, flush out a little bit more what specifically you are being able to increase pricing on and why? Kevin Nowlan : This is Kevin, I\u2019ll take that. From an aftermarket perspective over the last number of years, we\u2019ve consistently launched or executed pricing actions generally in the second fiscal quarter of the year. And, in fact, we\u2019ve executed pricing again in this current quarter in the aftermarket business. So that\u2019s been a pretty consistent trend for, at least, five or six years. On the OE side, it\u2019s been more opportunistic as opportunities arise with different markets or different OEs. And so, as we look at the commercial truck and industrial segment in the quarter, we saw a number of different geographies and a number of different customers in which we had some pricing actions that went into effect. Alex Potter : Okay. And presumably that\u2019s, I guess, related to the fact that right now, say, in North America, we are getting somewhere in the neighborhood of peakish order run rates. So the - I guess, the supply chain is somewhat constrained and you have more leverage to be able to request pricing increases? Kevin Nowlan : No, not - I mean, the countries in which we are under an LTA, if that LTA is still in effect and continuing, the pricing is already contractually locked in. So there aren\u2019t - there generally aren\u2019t mechanisms when you are in the middle of an LTA to change the pricing, unless you are launching new products or providing new features. It\u2019s really things that happen when either an LTA comes up for renewal or when you have, you are operating on a spot basis in certain markets, those are the types of opportunities. Alex Potter : Okay. So it has nothing to do with supply constraints in the supply chain? Ike Evans : No it does not, yes. Kevin Nowlan : That\u2019s correct. Alex Potter : Okay. And then shifting over to margins, obviously nice margins in aftermarket, how sustainable do you think they are going forward? Ike Evans : Very. I mean, we don\u2019t see - as a matter of fact the pricing opportunities we\u2019ve got are not this is necessarily just price per say. They are value-added services that we\u2019ve been in - product availability, 24-hour service. We are doing things that our customers put a value on and they are willing to pay for it. So the margins that we see are very sustainable. Kevin Nowlan : And I think we alluded to that last quarter as well. I think our Q4 margin was a little bit high. We were at a higher revenue level because we have seasonal - seasonality in the business that takes revenue down this quarter, but we also had some one-time favorability that was helping the results last quarter. And we indicated that we thought a normalized run rate at that type of revenue was a little bit north of this, and with revenue coming down a little bit in the quarter, this is right in line with our expectations. So I think, we do believe this to be sustainable as we go forward. Alex Potter : Okay, very good. And then the last question also on aftermarket, but specifically on Europe. I was wondering if you could kind of dive in there, I don\u2019t know if you have sort of visibility on what Europe\u2019s aftermarket specifically is doing by maybe region or sub-region within Europe, but is there any way that you can draw some insights out of those aftermarket trends that help inform your view of the new truck market? Ike Evans : Well, the aftermarket distribution channel in Europe is very much different than it is in this country. It\u2019s basically through the OEMs as opposed to - in the North American market, it goes through OEMs and distribution. I guess, the biggest impact to us in Europe is Russia. We have considerable revenue in Russia, and Russia obviously is uncertain at this point in time. Alex Potter : Okay. And no specific aftermarket trends up or down in Russia that would lead you to believe that things are getting better or worse there? Kevin Nowlan : Well, I think just generally with the issues that we\u2019ve seen in the Russian market it has impacted that piece of the business. It\u2019s not a majority of our business by any means, but it\u2019s still a meaningful piece of that business. So that has been impacted a little bit. And I think, the softness we\u2019ve seen overall in the European market, it\u2019s had a similar impact on the aftermarket business as well, even putting Russia side. Alex Potter : Okay, very good. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Ryan. Thanks for taking our questions. So the first question I have, I was just trying to get to what has really changed since you last issued guidance, and revenues looks softer on that front, but you are able to execute the stronger net higher margins. So wondering is this just a function of pulling in more cost sales in the business, or are you contemplating more pricing actions going forward in the future quarters, which is driving higher margins? What\u2019s really helping you drive that higher margin and the slightly softer revenue outlook for this year? Kevin Nowlan : I would say by and large, it\u2019s the performance of the business. I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s necessarily anything incremental beyond our expectations from a pricing perspective. I think it\u2019s just a lot of the cost initiatives are taking hold and sticking. We obviously, as I mentioned, had a few million dollars of one-time favorable items in the quarter about $3 million that we hadn\u2019t necessarily planned for. So it\u2019s a simple DOS around the top end of the guidance that we had previously given. Unidentified Analyst : Just a follow-up there, is there an X number that you\u2019ve quoted us to be cost save that you expect in this year incrementally over the last year? Kevin Nowlan : We haven\u2019t. I think the best way to dimension that, you can look at the sequential walks that we provide every quarter, and if you add up the components and think about what that means from a material labor and burden perspective, I think you can get in the ZIP code of what we expect to say. It\u2019s part of our M2016 initiative. We are driving for generating reduced material costs of about 2.5% of controllable spend and about 2.6% on the labor and burden side. Those are our targets, and we achieved those last year. So the combination of those things might give you a little bit of color. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And just more on the housekeeping side, you mentioned some one-time items benefiting your margin this quarter. Were they primarily on the aftermarket and trailer segment? I mean, I\u2019m just trying to get at whether the 12% margin there is sustainable, or was that benefiting from some one-off items this quarter, which don\u2019t really carry forward? Kevin Nowlan : No, it was - I would say, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t really related to aftermarket in particular. So there are no real discrete items. There were some accrual reversals that impacted both segments, and there were a couple discrete items more on the truck side, I would say. Unidentified Analyst : So it\u2019s fair to assume that the aftermarket and trailer segment margins are sustainable in the quarters going forward? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Good. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kristine Kubacki from Avondale Partners. Please proceed. Kristine Kubacki : Hey, good morning, guys. Ike Evans : Good morning. Kristine Kubacki : Not to beat a dead horse a little bit, but I\u2019m a little confused, I guess, on the DTNA when you say a majority supplier. It was my understanding and I may have this completely wrong, but that as they spec out their most popular evolution package that you have to have their supplied axles. And I guess, and then I guess, when you say majority supplier to them, are you talking as a third-party supplier? And then, I guess, how do you monitor if, in fact, how you maintain a majority market share if, indeed to spec in the evolution package you have to have at Daimler axle? Ike Evans : Well, I will let Kevin to take it in a little more detail, but keep in mind that the fleets spec the products that they want, now they - DTNA offers the Detroit package, but the fleets can request a Meritor axle on that drivetrain if they choose. So it\u2019s just not that that - that\u2019s one of the potential offerings, but it is just one of the potential offerings. Kevin Nowlan : And don\u2019t forget, I think Detroit axle is standard for Daimler. It has been for a long time, yet we command a majority of the Class 8 rear axle supply for Daimler and continue to do so today. So it\u2019s exactly as I described, the fleets can specify, which axles they would like on their vehicles and more often than not they select a Meritor axle on the Class 8. Kristine Kubacki : Okay. And then just - and that\u2019s helpful and something we haven\u2019t talked about in a little bit. But you are still the preferred supplier for Navistar as well, correct? Kevin Nowlan : We are standard position, yes. Ike Evans : Yes. Kristine Kubacki : Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And then one last question, in terms of the PACCAR ramp up, how can we think about that? Is it going to take two years to ramp-up, and then I guess, how - with your traditional market share being a preferred supplier, where do you think you get to, is it 50%, is it 80% over time? Kevin Nowlan : A couple of points there, I think we\u2019ll see the majority of the income on this new contract in our income statement by the end of next year. So we would expect to see the bulk of the ramp-up happen by the end of 2016. In terms of where that puts us from a penetration perspective, we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day next week. Kristine Kubacki : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I look forward to seeing you guys there. Thank you. Kevin Nowlan : Right, thank you. Ike Evans : Okay, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will be the last question of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Carl Anderson : Thank you. We do appreciate your participation in today\u2019s call. As a reminder, we are hosting our Analyst Day event next week on February 5, that we hope to see you there. This concludes our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, sir. Carl D. Anderson - Treasurer, VP & Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Alison. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call today, we have Ike Evans, Jay Craig and Kevin Nowlan. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

To the extent we'll refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Ike. Ike J. Evans - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Carl, and good morning. I assume most of you have seen our two press releases this morning, so you know that we've continued to expand EBITDA margin in the quarter and we've also made an important management change that we'll talk about today as well. This is an exciting time for Meritor. We're meeting our commitments we made under the umbrella of M2016. We're executing our management succession plan and we're taking steps to strengthen and grow our core business with robust product development and launch cycle. Let's turn to slide three for a look at the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 10.1% on revenue; that's down $90 million year-over-year. This represents a 170 basis point improvement from the same quarter in fiscal 2014. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter also improved $0.17 year-over-year. The decrease in revenue that we saw this quarter was driven primarily by continued weak commercial truck production in Brazil, actually the lowest volumes we've seen there in a decade, and in China, as well as the depreciation of currency primarily in South America and Europe. In July of last year, we announced that we'd repurchase up to $210 million of our equity or equity-linked securities. During the second quarter, we began that program by repurchasing $31 million of securities. We've also said this is the first time since 2008 that we've been in a position to return value directly to Meritor shareholders. We're on track to complete the entire repurchase program by the end of fiscal year 2016. As you look at our full year guidance, we're raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin and earnings per share. The margin improvement we're anticipating for the year is performance driven. This along with our expectation of a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 is driving the expected improvement in earnings per share, of which Kevin will provide more detail. Let's turn to slide four. As I said, I'm very pleased to tell you that we've taken an important step in our management succession plan. Effective immediately, I will be transitioning to a new role as Executive Chairman and Jay Craig, currently President and Chief Operating Officer will become Meritor's next CEO and President. When I was appointed CEO, the board and I made succession planning a top priority. We wanted to ensure that we identified the right leader for Meritor's next phase of growth and development. I have worked with Jay since 2006 as a board member and we've worked closely together in a partnership relationship the last two years in implementing our M2016 strategy. This is the natural evolution of that partnership. Together with an outstanding management team, we've turned challenges into opportunities and today Meritor is stronger than it's ever been. In my new role, I'll work closely with Jay and the rest of the management team to achieve our M2016 goals and set the future direction of the company beyond 2016. And I'll remain actively engaged as we establish our path to drive continued increases in shareholder value. Jay is a talented executive and an excellent leader. As you recall, he has served in a number of key financial and operational roles at the company and was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 2014. Over the past couple of years, Jay has strengthened our customer relationships, driven a more robust product development cycle and focused on improving operational performance of our company. The board and I are confident that his unique combination of commercial and financial expertise makes him ideally suited to lead Meritor at this important time in our history. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Ike. First, let me say that I'm honored to be Meritor's next CEO. We've made significant progress toward achieving our three year plan during Ike's tenure. I am looking forward to continuing that collaboration with him in his new role as Executive Chairman. I appreciate the board's and Ike's vote of confidence and I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity to work closely with him as we take Meritor to the next level. This is a unique company because of the passion and commitment of our 9,000 employees. The depth of that commitment has become even clearer to me as I've led the operations over the past few years. I joined Meritor in 2006 and although it was a company in transition, I knew I had joined an organization with a solid foundation and the potential to drive value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. I was energized to be part of a team with more than a 100-year legacy of innovation and expertise in commercial drivetrain solutions. I'm even more energized today as we successfully execute our M2016 plan and enter a new chapter in our history. Let's now look at slide five. As we continue to deliver strong results, I'm confident that we will achieve the three overriding objectives of M2016. Our execution continues to be solid in a very strong North American truck cycle that has obviously tested the entire supply chain. The team has driven significant improvements in material, labor and burden performance, which are favorably impacting our bottom line financial results. As orders continue to be strong in North America with a backlog-to-build ratio of approximately six months, we continue to successfully convert on incremental sales through excellent management of our operating and product costs. We previously said we would achieve a 10% EBITDA margin, but only at certain levels of revenue. Given our strong execution to-date and robust pipeline of performance and revenue initiatives heading into next year, we now believe we will achieve that margin without any significant change in our end markets. During the last two years, we've also generated significant cash flows from operations, the settlement of the Eaton litigation and the sale of a non-core business that has allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly $500 million. Overall, this performance has provided us with the balance sheet improvement necessary to grow with our customers, and we are. We're winning new business with global manufacturers like PACCAR that we just announced last quarter, among many others. As a result, we're more than 60% of the way toward achieving our $500 million target in new business wins and we remain confident that we'll achieve our full run rate. Each award solidifies our position as a leading supplier to every major truck OE in the world. Our mission is to provide these manufacturers with products that their customers need in each local market. Meritor products are designed and manufactured for maximum efficiency with the highest standards in durability and reliability. To complement our growing product portfolio, we also offer outstanding support in the field. Our team helps customers optimize their businesses from product specification to aftermarket service and support. It's all part of the Meritor value proposition that I believe in very strongly. After spending years with the company in finance followed by several more on the commercial side, I have a tremendous appreciation for our people and their talent, the incredible value of our products, our customers and the importance of the trucking industry overall. Before we move on, let me say that I'm confident we will continue to meet our commitments and by doing so drive enhanced value for our shareholders. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to lead such a great company that has so much potential. Now, let's move to slide six. As we said, we're driving higher levels of excellence throughout our operations and improving new net material performance. With an aligned focus on these activities around the globe, we are seeing outstanding results, some of which are highlighted here. In February, we told you that we've put some of our best executives and resources on labor, burden, and material performance, because these are areas we can control and we are leveraging them to drive expanded EBITDA margins. But, it doesn't end there. We're continuing to identify areas for improvement, not only in labor, burden, and material, but also in delivery, quality and safety. Collectively, the improvements we're making in these areas are enabling us to meet the challenges of higher production levels, first in Europe last year and now in North America, with near perfection. Let's go to slide seven. Looking into the future, we believe that there is significant revenue potential with an expanded product portfolio. This is a critical element of our plan as it relates to future growth. We have prioritized the 20 most important product launches for the company and are driving them to flawless execution. The result of this focus is that our current launch cycle is the most aggressive in our company's history, and most important, each of these products has a home. We've worked with our customers to design axles, brakes, drivelines and suspensions that will enhance the value of their vehicles in alignment with their forward product programs. Launching next month in India is our hub reduction axle targeted at severe service and off-highway applications for emerging markets. This axle is based on Meritor's current hub reduction design that's provided outstanding performance in harsh applications for more than a decade. This product will launch in India with our customers Daimler and Ashok Leyland. In August of this year, we'll offer the super-fast 2.28 ratio on the 14X platform that can be integrated with Meritor's RPL 35 driveline, which was successfully launched this year. This product combination will effectively handle higher torques from downspeeding, allowing the driver to maintain vehicle speed at lower engine RPMs and enhancing vehicle efficiency. And next year, we'll launch the 14X high efficiency tandem axle that will offer more than a 1% efficiency improvement over our current class leading 14X, which translates to roughly a 1% fuel savings for our customers. In our Defense business, Meritor has been a strategic partner in Lockheed Martin's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program since 2007. We've completed more than 400,000 miles of testing to-date on our ProTec suspension that increases vehicle speed and improves handling and ride control. As you know, the JLTV program is planned to be awarded by the government in the summer of this year. However, full run rate production would not be achieved until 2018. We highlight it here because of its significant long-term revenue potential. These are just a few examples of the innovative products we're launching that create the pipeline which will support our growth beyond 2016. Now let's turn to slide eight for our current fiscal year 2015 market outlook. In North America, we continue to believe, as we told you last quarter, that the strong backlogs and low cancellation rates will carry current production levels through the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We're holding our current outlook for Class 8 volumes in this region to a range of 305,000 units to 315,000 units. Our forecast for medium duty production is unchanged as well. Europe remains flat from our previous forecast at a midpoint of 390,000 units. In South America, we've lowered our production outlook to a midpoint of 95,000 units for the fiscal year. Consumer and business confidence continue to fall, driven in part by the political situation in Brazil. Long-term forecasts indicate a slow economic recovery, with GDP decreasing and interest rates increasing in the near-term. Specific to the commercial truck market, revisions to the FINAME program, used to finance more than 70% of truck and bus purchases in the country, has made it significantly more expensive to purchase a commercial vehicle. Even without the negative impact of currency that we're seeing, the Brazilian production headwinds alone are driving our 2015 revenue expectations lower by nearly $100 million from our prior guidance. Finally, we expect China to be down an additional 20% from our prior outlook due to continued economic headwinds. The deterioration in these international markets combined with the unfavorable currency impact from the depreciating real and the euro are driving our revenue expectations lower for the year. Kevin will provide the full update on our 2015 guidance later. As I said earlier in the call, however, we're confident in our ability to achieve our margin target of 10% in fiscal 2016. We are anticipating significantly less help from the global markets than originally planned when we launched M2016, but we have outperformed expectations in the areas we've highlighted. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you and good morning. Let's turn to slide nine. On today's call, I'll review our second quarter financial results and then I'll take you through our revised 2015 guidance. Overall, the key takeaway you'll see from our results is that we continued to improve our financial performance while facing challenging global markets including currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our M2016 strategies are continuing to generate margin performance and bottom-line EPS that is overcoming all of these headwinds. As a result, in the second quarter we generated adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.1% and $42 million of adjusted income from continuing operations. So, let's walk through the details on slide nine, where you'll see our second quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $864 million in the quarter, down $90 million or 9% year-over-year. Sales were negatively impacted by $55 million, largely because of the weaker Brazilian real and euro. Lower production in South America and China, as well as lower revenue from our Defense business, also contributed to the decrease. This was partially offset by the continued strength of the Class 8 truck market in North America. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 13.3%, reflecting a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was driven by continued material labor and burden performance and pricing actions consistent with our M2016 strategy, as well as some non-recurring gains on foreign exchange hedges. I'll provide more detail on this later. SG&A was $9 million lower in the second quarter. The decrease was due to lower variable incentive compensation accruals and lower pension expense. Restructuring costs were $3 million this quarter and were primarily related to severance costs associated with restructuring actions taken in our European truck business. Interest expense was $21 million in the second quarter, compared to $48 million a year ago. The decrease was mostly due to the loss on debt extinguishment that was recognized in the prior year relating to the repurchase of our 10-5/8% notes due in 2018. Interest expense was also lower year-over-year due to the benefits we're now experiencing from the capital market transactions we executed last year. Income tax expense was $6 million in the second quarter, representing a decrease of $2 million compared to the prior year, despite the fact that pre-tax income was higher this year. Our effective tax rate was only 13% this quarter. We're beginning to generate earnings in jurisdictions such as the U.S. and parts of Western Europe where we previously established reserves against our deferred tax assets. All of that totals up to adjusted income from continuing operations of $42 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Slide 10 shows second quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. Sales were $681 million, down $82 million or 11% from the same period last year. We saw lower production in South America, China, and Defense, and experienced approximately $53 million of FX headwinds in this segment. These revenue headwinds were partially offset by higher sales in North America due to the strong Class 8 truck market. Segment EBITDA was $57 million, which was flat compared to the prior year. However, segment EBITDA margin was 8.4% in the quarter, representing a 90 basis point improvement. A combination of continued strong material and operational performance, pricing actions, and gains from foreign exchange hedges, more than offset the unfavorable revenue and mix impacts associated with lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and lower Defense revenue. Next on slide 11, we summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $212 million, down $13 million from last year, due to currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $30 million, up $6 million over last year. Similar to our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, the increase was driven by continued strong execution of material and operational performance and pricing. Now let's move to slide 12, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q1 to Q2. Walking from the $79 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in our first quarter, the net impact of volume, mix and pricing was roughly flat for the quarter. The impact of higher sales in North America Truck in India was offset by lower sales in South America. We continued to execute on our M2016 objectives of achieving material, labor and burden savings. These initiatives along with slightly lower steel prices provided an incremental $5 million benefit sequentially from the first quarter. Next, we experienced a $28 million foreign exchange translation impact on sales. The translation and transaction impacts of foreign currencies negatively affected EBITDA by $4 million. However, as I previously mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized mark-to-market gains associated with several foreign exchange hedges that were put on to protect against certain transaction and translation risks. First, in April 2014, we bought option contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure on expected Indian rupee purchasing activity through the end of 2016. In the quarter, we've monetized these contracts and simultaneously entered into a new series of contracts that now extend through the end of fiscal year 2017. We also generated mark-to-market earnings on option contracts that we purchased last quarter to mitigate volatility in the translation of Brazilian earnings into U.S. dollars during 2015. Although these FX contracts are hedging actual exposures of the company, they do not receive hedge accounting treatment for U.S. GAAP purposes. As a result, the gains we've recognized this quarter represent the mark-to-market benefit associated with underlying economic exposure for both this quarter, some of which you see noted as a negative in the line item above, and future quarters. In the second quarter, these hedges generated a $6 million one-time benefit to our results. So, as you think about our go-forward earnings profile, you should assume that this benefit will not repeat in future quarters. Finally, we had an other net increase in EBITDA of $1 million. This includes a couple million dollars of additional one-time gains that we do not expect to repeat. Overall, this was a strong quarter for us, even considering the revenue headwinds. We generated $87 million of adjusted EBITDA, which resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.1%. And even if you exclude the favorable one-time items in the quarter, we still would have generated adjusted EBITDA margin north of 9%. Now, let's turn to slide 13. For the second quarter, total free cash flow was $27 million, representing an $18 million improvement over the same period last year. The increase was due to higher earnings and lower outflows associated with our off-balance-sheet factoring programs. Our year-to-date free cash flow was slightly positive, which is a little better than where we were this time last year. This performance puts us on track to achieve our $100 million free cash flow guidance for 2015. Now, let's move to slide 14, which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. During the second quarter, we commenced our $210 million buyback program. We repurchased 1.2 million of common shares during the course of the quarter, utilizing $16 million of cash. We also repurchased $15 million of our 4% convertible notes due 2027. In total, we essentially utilized the free cash flow we generated in the quarter to repurchase $31 million of equity and equity-linked securities, which puts us right on track to complete the program by September 2016. From an EPS perspective, we received only half a quarter's worth of benefit associated with the share repurchases. In future quarters, we will get the full benefit of the 1.2 million in common equity repurchases executed during Q2. This will help to offset any dilution impact associated with our 7-7/8% convertible notes due 2026, which were dilutive by about 3 million shares in the quarter. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2015 outlook on slide 15. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted on slide eight and the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we have lowered our fiscal year 2015 sales guidance to a range of $3.5 billion to $3.55 billion. Lower production expectations in Brazil and China are negatively impacting revenue by $120 million. You can see our new currency assumptions reflected on the slide for the second half of 2015. The continued depreciation of foreign currencies is creating $40 million of additional revenue headwinds since we provided guidance in Q1. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we're slightly increasing our margin outlook. We now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 9.0% to 9.2% compared to our previous guidance of approximately 9%. We expect to drive this margin result largely through continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives. Our effective income tax rate is now expected to be approximately 15% for 2015 compared to our previous guidance of approximately 20%. Lower earnings in tax-paying jurisdictions like Brazil and China are being offset by continued improvement in earnings in non-taxpaying jurisdictions like the U.S. and much of Western Europe. Driven primarily by this improvement in the effective income tax rate, we are also raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a range of $1.30 to $1.40 for fiscal year 2015, which is an increase of $0.10 compared to our prior guidance. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $100 million for 2015, which means we're expecting back-to-back years of cash flow at or above the $100 million level. The bottom line is that we're expecting production in South America and overall currency impacts to be worse than we previously thought, but despite that we're expecting bottom-line earnings to improve and cash flow to remain right on track. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide some closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 16. As Ike said in the beginning of the call, this is an exciting time for us. We are taking a disciplined approach to improving the performance of the company. M2016 is really about securing our base business by taking actions that drive excellence throughout our global operations, enhancing customer relationships and executing a robust product development cycle and improving material performance in a sustainable way. M2016, we sharpened our focus under the program and we defined the nine initiatives that we believed would create the transformation we needed at Meritor to improve our financial performance, and we made sure that every resource in the company was dedicated to it. It's now been approximately two years since we launched this program; our focus has not changed. With just over a year-and-a-half left, we are determined to deliver on our commitments. The actions we've taken since launching M2016 continue to drive solid bottom-line performance in spite of currency depreciation and volume declines. These are among the best EBITDA margin, net income and free cash flow results we have ever had. Ike and I, together with the entire management team, are fully committed to achieving the objectives of this plan. So, what does Meritor look like for shareholders in 2016 upon completion of the plan? We will have reduced the volatility associated with our industry through improved cash flow and lower debt levels. We will have a leaner fixed cost structure, improved operating footprint and a differentiated product base. We'll have built a culture of innovative thinking in all areas of the business and ultimately we will have provided a strong return on investment for our shareholders. With that, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Please go ahead. Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thank you so much. This is actually Justin Barell on behalf of Itay. Ike, Jay, congrats. The first question that I have I guess really is for Jay. With regards to the first 100 days for your plan, is there anything that we should expect any changes on or can you give us maybe a walkthrough of what you guys are expecting for the first 100-day plan for you? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks a lot for the question, Justin. The short answer is no. I mean, I think the execution and performance of the company has been nothing short of outstanding and we want to continue to execute the M2016 plan. As you can see from our revised guidance today that execution has been very strong, but we still have roughly 100 basis points of margin improvement that we expect to execute before the end of the plan. And it's certainly my job and with Ike's assistance to make sure that we just continue to stay focused on that. Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thanks so much. And then, can you give us a sense of maybe an update on Defense quoting that you guys are involved with, just to kind of gauge the vertical and see how everything's progressing? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, like I mentioned in my comments, the primary program we're focused on is JLTV. We expect that award towards the latter part of the summer, and so we are waiting for that award. But in the comments I mentioned in the Analyst Day, the one thing I'd like to make clear is our belief in hitting our objectives of M2016 is not dependent upon the award to us of that program or any other single program. Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. And then, I believe on the call, it was mentioned that the slightly lower steel commodity prices, you guys are having a modest tailwind. Can you give us a sense of how to think about that for the \u2013 through the end of fiscal 2015? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. This is Kevin Nowlan. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, the steel tailwind in the quarter for us sequentially was about $2 million. So, when you look at that $5 million sequential improvement in material, labor and burden, $2 million of it came from steel. With where indices are in steel right now, we'd expect a little bit of additional tailwind into Q3, but then we would expect to start giving that back through our passthrough mechanisms to customers in Q4 and into the beginning of 2016. So, it becomes a headwind at the back half of the year and into 2016, but it's a little bit of a tailwind this quarter. Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. And then, so in terms of the normalized cadence throughout the year, should we expect something similar to what 2014 was for the back two quarters? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Cadence in what regard? I'm sorry, Justin. Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just overall financial cadence. Essentially, the quarter-over- quarter improvements and everything like that. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think it's right. I mean, I think if you cut through what our guidance is suggesting, you would expect that the back half of the year is going to be much closer to 9% and in part because generating 10.1% is based on a lot of proactive actions we took to hedge some of the exposures we have and to execute on our operating performance. But those hedges aren't going to repeat in the back half. So, when you eliminate those non-recurring items or those one-timers for the quarter, our run rate's probably right now closer to 9% than it is to 10%. Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Right, okay. And then, just one final question that I want to ask on the South American outlook. Just trying to figure out exactly how much of the delta between your prior outlook versus the current outlook is driven by pessimism versus the financing terms? Is there a right way to think about that, like what's driving what and just exactly -- if you were to bucket the majority of the delta, would that fall more under just the general pessimism of the market or is that really just predicated on the financing programs? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : All right. I think the two are very interlinked. I mean, obviously, Brazil's economic reforms they're executing are pretty far-reaching. As I mentioned in my comments on the call, the impact to us directly through the commercial vehicle program is the FINAME program, but I think our revised outlook is really driven by just the overall macroeconomic conditions. Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thank you, guys, so much and again, congrats, guys. Thank you. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning and congratulations, Jay, and hope, Ivor, you'll \u2013 Ike, you'll stay around for a while. Just a technical question, then a broader question. My technical question is the FX hedge impact, and this goes to your background, Jay, under I guess, what is it, FAS 133 that you have hedge gains realized before the offsetting underlying transactions. Can you give us a sense of just how that affected that? Are these covering up for \u2013 or not covering up -- are these sort of transactional exposures that are going to be either a headwind in later quarters or were actually in the quarter but you're calling those out separately? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : I appreciate your confidence in my memory skills, but obviously my CPA days are many years behind. But I think the company has done an excellent job of both hedging transaction risk, but on a limited basis, hedging some translation risk as well. But I'm going to turn your specific question over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Brian, it's a fair question. I mean as you look at the $6 million of gains that we booked about $4 million of that $6 million relates to 2015 activity, the bulk of that being in the current quarter, and then some of that extending beyond the quarter, which means there is a couple million dollars of the hedge gains that we generated in the quarter that relate to future periods, which is really some of the rupee, euro purchasing activity that we've been hedging. So as we've been executing on our best-cost country sourcing initiative, we've been hedging out the curve two years and three years of purchasing activity to make sure that we can reap the benefits for the longer term on those programs. And so we continue to have hedges on the books to hedge against that activity going forward. So while we're not going to get that $2 million benefit anymore, we're going to continue to have a hedge position that protects against some of those currency moves. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I guess the broader question is you kept your Class 8 outlook unchanged. If you look at ACT, it's up to 335,000 now. Are you being \u2013 two questions, kind of are you being conservative, or do you see weakness in the back half of the year? I guess, two, if there is a run rate of 330,000, maybe it continues into next year, it goes up. Where are you vis-\u00e0-vis capacity? In particular, are you talking about a customer a couple quarters ago who was apparently building some in-house capacity to handle peaky kind of demand, kind of where does that stand if we have a market running in the 330,000s versus the 310,000s? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think just to answer the question in sections, we feel very good about our capacity, I mean we've run quarters of production roughly at 80,000 units for a quarter. And if you look at our forecast, it's really stating that the production levels will remain roughly at where they are today. I mean this last quarter was close to 80,000 units and we're seeing that the \u2013 our forecast for the Q3 and Q4 is that they stay within 75,000 units to 80,000 units. So I think we're confident in where our forecast is. And so far we have not had any capacity issues in meeting our customers' demand, and in fact, have been able to fill some shortfalls elsewhere in the supply chain. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And similarly in Europe, you remain conservative there, some of the customers, again, Daimler, are seeing some upside there. Is this kind of, more kind of you think it's more your fiscal 2016 or you just want to be conservative for now? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : That's exactly it, Brian, is it's really, I think our outlook is very similar to what you've heard recently from some of the European OEs. There is really two impacts of fiscal year to calendar year comparison. We have obviously the negative impact of the pre-buy that occurred late in 2012 \u2013 2013, and then missing the fourth quarter here of 2015. So if you neutralize for those two impacts, we have a very similar outlook to what you've heard from the European OEs recently. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And back to North America, if North America fiscal 2016 runs sort of 335,000 or higher, are you comfortable a) with the capacity and b) that the customers aren't going to be taking stuff you'd like in-house? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, we are not really talking about any outlook yet for 2016, as you know, because of our \u2013 where our fiscal year falls, we end up being one of the first people to talk about that. But we're not ready yet at this point. In terms of our capacity, I think we feel very comfortable and very closely aligned with all our customers, including our growing relationship with PACCAR, that we can meet their needs based on what they're forecasting for production for the foreseeable future. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning and congrats, Ike and Jay, on today's announcement as well. The 10% EBITDA margin in FY2016, you believe you can now achieve without any significant change in end markets. So just to clarify, would that be essentially based on FY2015 sales guidance range and then layering in incremental PACCAR business, or do you still need modest end market growth? I think before you kind of had called out like a $4.2 billion type number. Could you just provide some more granularity on that? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think the way we look at it is if the global mix remains roughly the same and if we include the wins that we have achieved and reported out previously, we believe we can hit the guidance. So, yes, it includes the PACCAR win. And so, that gives us the confidence that we can achieve that margin target. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Great. And then, regarding the expected market share recapture at DT&A for axles next year, have you seen any order activity yet for next year that would support that or is it still too early to tell at this point? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Actually, we feel confident in the statement that we made at the Analyst Day back in February that this was temporary, it's been rectified, and we're comfortable that it's meeting both ours and Daimler's expectations of where our penetrations would be. And more importantly, Daimler has been extremely pleased with our deliveries and that we've been part of their, helping them drive their sales success. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : All right. And then, maybe one last one for Kevin. The $6 million in hedge gains, do you have the breakdown by segment? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The bulk of it is Commercial Truck & Industrial, but there is a little bit more than $1 million in the Aftermarket & Trailer segment as well. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kristine Kubacki of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead. Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC : Good morning. I was just \u2013 we've been watching -- most of the global OEMs, they've kind of reversed their outlook and upgraded their outlook on India. I was just curious on why you didn't increase your forecast there. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We're certainly seeing growth in India as well. I think you're seeing people talk about a 10% market increase, and we're roughly seeing that as well, but the impact on our overall forecast is not significant. So, and a lot of that increase will start to come towards the end of the calendar year, given our fiscal year-end of September 30. But definitely the Indian market is strengthening. I think people can clearly say it's found bottom and it's recovering. And it's recovering well for our customer Ashok Leyland as well. Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC : That's helpful. And then I guess, you talked a little bit about the restructuring activities have been kind of centered around Europe. I was wondering \u2013 I hope there is going to be an eventual upturn in markets of China and Brazil. I guess, how are you prepared for, have you taken any restructuring activities in those markets and then how are you prepared if the market moves quickly on you to the upside? How do you respond to that? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : This is Kevin, I'll take that. I mean with Brazil, I think we got out ahead of it, to be honest. We took some restructuring actions, you'll recall, back in August 2014, so at the tail end of last fiscal year, when we saw this, the headwinds really starting to mount in Brazil. And you can imagine as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor that market and see if there are additional actions that we need to take in light of where the market currently is. So, we'll keep an eye on that and keep looking at that as we go forward. And then, as you can imagine, as we did in Europe, we look at other markets as well just to see if there are other areas where we should be focused to improve our cost structure. So, always something that we're looking at as we go through these difficult international markets. Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC : But you could prepare for an upturn pretty quickly. There has no -- been major structural changes in those markets that you can prepare for a recovery that's -quickly? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : We feel confident we can respond to a recovery. We're in constant communication with our customers in all markets and informing them of our restructuring actions and what our ability is to provide them axles and brakes as the markets recover. Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC : And then I just want to clarify one thing. You talk a lot about the Western European market. You don't have any exposure to Eastern Europe or Russia? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Very limited other than through our primary customer, Volvo. They have some exposure in Eastern Europe. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, and on the Aftermarket side, I think we talked that in prior quarters. It's less than $20 million of revenue that goes into Russia, in the $10 million, $20 million range. Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC : That's helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Hi, good morning. And yeah, congratulations, Jay, as well. Very much looking forward to working with you in your new role. And Ike, we've definitely appreciated the leadership and the transition that we've seen in this company under your direction as well. So, congratulations to you both. Just in terms of my questions, wanted to just follow up on the PACCAR item. I know that was something that was potentially impactful near-term. Have you been seeing the kind of take rate in PACCAR orders on the back of the change of standing in the quoting book? I guess that would be my first question. And then a second one would be just on Europe. I think there had been some discussion that within Europe, even though the outlook for the market is still relatively flat, some of the northern companies, kind of like Volvo and Scania have been doing a little bit better than some of the other guys, and just wanted to get your sense of if that's something you're seeing on the ground there as well. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. Well starting with PACCAR, we're very pleased, I would say overall we're seeing our penetrations increase at the pace that both us and PACCAR expected them to, and we see our relationship broadening every day, particularly with their operating units of Kenworth and Peterbilt. So. just on track, is what I would say. And I believe that's a view held by both sides, that we are very much on track. In terms of Northern Europe, certainly has been the story since the economic downturn, is that has tended to be stronger. But again, our primary customers are Volvo/Renault, and they've had a bit of a mixed market experience because of their Renault exposure, and Iveco, which tends to be more Southern Europe exposed. But, I would say overall on our European business, we are very pleased with its performance. And back to an earlier question, we have taken the restructuring actions that, where we're very pleased with the profitability of that business and are prepared to operate it at these volume levels if necessary for longer and be pleased with the performance. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Terrific. That's all I had for you guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Carl D. Anderson - Treasurer, VP & Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Alison, and thank you, everybody for joining the call today. This does conclude Meritor's second quarter 2015 earnings call.

Jay Craig : Thanks Carl, and good morning everyone. I told you in April that I was confident in our ability to beat our commitments and drive enhanced value for our shareholders. Our results this quarter demonstrate the progress we are making toward our M2016 objective and provide us with increased confidence for the future. Our financial performance also demonstrates the efforts we have put in to managing labor, burden and material performance to drive expanded margins. At the same time we are growing through new contracts with important customers like PACCAR that we will talk about today. Looking at Slide 3, you will see that the quarter reflects continued strong execution, while revenues were down $70 million year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable currency headwinds. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 120 basis points year-over-year at 9.6% for the quarter which puts our year-to-date margin at 9.5%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter also improved $0.12 from fiscal 2014 which demonstrates that our improved to margins are translating to bottom line earnings for our shareholders. In July of last year we announced $210 million share repurchase program, which was the first time we have returned value directly to the shareholders since 2000 and date. In the second quarter of the fiscal year we repurchased $31 million of securities and this quarter we repurchased another $18 million. We remained on track to complete the entire repurchase program by the end of fiscal 2016. We also refinanced and repurchased a portion of convertible notes which will help reduced the dilution impact to the number of shares outstanding going forward. Although volume headwinds outside of North America have continued to present challenges our performance throughout the year has exceeded our expectations and were attend raising our outlook for earnings and cash flow. Let's turn to Slide 4, in January of this year we announced a long-term agreement with PACCAR for rear axles in North America and in Australia. At full run rate we told you we expected revenues to be approximately $150 million as we ramp up to more than 50% penetration for rare drive axles on PACCAR brands. Today we're pleased to tell you that we've added standard positioning for front steer axles to that agreement reflecting execution on another opportunity for growth in our core business. This change formally took place in data books on July 1st, for Kenworth and Peterbuilt trucks, although we started to see the penetration ramp up earlier in the year. We expect revenue from this piece of the business to be approximately $40 million at full run rate. Wins like this are an important part of our M2016 plan to organically grow the business by expanding product plans with our global customers. Now let's turn to Slide 5, in terms of volumes in North America we're slightly increasing our outlook for Class 8 volumes to approximately 325,000 units. Class 8 net orders have resulted in a strong backlog-to-build ratio of just over five months which we believe will carry current production levels into fiscal 2016. Related to the trailer business our forecast remains unchanged for the year. This month we purchased the majority of the assets of the Cyprus facility in North Carolina that produces us trailer axle beams and machines carriers and differentials for us. The work done at this facility is important to our trailer operation. This transaction allows us to further stabilize our supply chain and become more vertically integrated as we explore our opportunities to grow this business. Europe remains flat from our previous forecast at a midpoint of 390,000 units but is continuing to show signs of a potential economic recovery where reflected in slightly higher order intake at our major customers. In China we're reducing our volume outlook to reflect a 35% volume to increase year-over-year. This market continues to be volatile as the mining and construction markets remain extremely weak. South America continues to face a number of challenges as well; we produce our production outlook in this region to a range of 85,000 to 90,000 units for the fiscal year. India on the other hand is showing signs of recovery, growth prospects in the region are improving as the government drives structural, fiscal and bureaucratic reforms. While the Light Commercial segment remains weak there is an increased demand for a higher tonnage vehicles. We've therefore raised our forecast for this region by 10,000 units. And finally in our defense business you know we are partnered with Lockheed Martin of the JLTV program. We expect to file award announcement later this quarter. At this point I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 6. On today's call, I'll review our third quarter financial results and then I'll take you through our revised 2015 guidance. Overall, the key takeaway you'll see from our results is that we continued to drive financial performance. Our M2016 strategies are generating improved with margins and bottom-line EPS. As a result, in the third quarter we generated adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.6% and $41 million of adjusted income from continuing operations. So, let's walk through the details on slide, where you'll see our third quarter income statement compared to the prior year. Sales were $909 million in the quarter, down $70 million or 7% year-over-year. The lower revenue was driven entirely by currency headwinds in Europe and Brazil. Without the stronger U.S dollar revenue would have been higher this year versus last year. As robust production in North America truck and other revenue increases more than offset lower production in South America and China. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 13.6%, reflecting a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was driven by continued material labor and burden performance and pricing actions consistent with our M2016 strategy. SG&A was $12 million higher in the third quarter compared to the prior year. The increase was due to a $20 million recovery of legal fees associated with Eaton antitrust settlement in prior-year, which did not repeat this year. Excluding this SG&A costs were actually lower by $8 million, mostly due to lower spending and variable in front of competition accruals. Restructuring costs were $9 million this quarter and were related to severance costs associated with previously announced restructuring actions taken in our South America truck business. As well as cost associated with the closure of our Newark Ohio facility. Interest expense was $38 million in the third quarter compared to $22 million a year ago. The increase is due to $19 million loss on debt extinguishment that was recognize this quarter as a result of the repurchase of 85 million of our 7-7/8% convertible notes. I\u2019ll provide more detail on the balance sheet actions we executed this quarter later in the presentation. Excluding this loss interest expense decreased by $3 million year-over-year due to the benefits we're now experiencing from the capital markets transactions we executed last year. Income tax expense was $6 million in the third quarter representing an effective tax rate of 27%. The rate was higher than what we had experienced the last couple quarters, primarily due to the impact of the $19 million loss on debt extinguishment for which no tax benefit was recognized. Excluding this loss our effective tax rate would be in approximately 15%. Reflecting the fact that we are generating positive operating earnings in jurisdictions like the U.S. and parts of Western Europe where we have valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. All of that totals to adjusted income from continuing operations of $41 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Slide 7 shows third quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck industrial. Sales were $705 million down $56 million or 7% from the same period last year. FX headwinds were more than $70 million year-over-year which means that stronger sales primarily in our North America truck business more than offset the lower production we experienced in South America and China. Segment EBITDA was $58 million an increase of $3 million compared to the prior year. Segment EBITDA margin was 8.2% in the quarter representing 100 basis point improvements. The combination of continued cost performance and pricing actions more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue. Next on Slide 8, we summarize the aftermarket and trailer segment financial results. Sales were $233 million down $20 million from last year mostly due to currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $31 million up $3 million over last year. Similar to our commercial truck and industrial segment the increase was driven by continued cost performance and pricing actions. The segment EBITDA margin of 13.3% is in line with what we told you the last couple quarters to expect from this business at these levels of revenue. Now let's move to Slide 9, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q2 to Q3. Walking from the $87 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in our second quarter the net impact of volume mix and pricing was $10 million for the quarter. Higher sales in North America and European truck more than offset the impact of lower sales in South America. We continue to execute on our M2016 objective of achieving material labor and burdens savings. The incremental $7 million benefit sequentially from the second quarter includes both $3 million for performance and $4 million benefit associated with lower cost due to steel index movements. The benefit from the index movements is partially offset in the pricing line of above as we passed through the impact of prior period changes to our customers this quarter. Next foreign exchange movements negatively affected EBITDA by $3 million in the third quarter. Moving down the schedule you recall that we generated a one-time $6 million benefit last quarter related to mark-to-market gains associated with several foreign exchange hedges. This benefit was discreet to the second quarter and is a margin headwind to us on a sequential basis. We also experienced an incremental $6 million headwind associated with variable incentive compensation accruals. The sequential change includes the impact of a booth some favorable accrual adjustments last quarter combine with an increase in accrual this quarter. The portion booked in the current quarter reflects the increased accrual related our updated earnings and cash flow outlook for 2015 which I\u2019ll discuss in a few slides. Overall this was a strong margin quarter for us. We generated $87 million of adjusted EBITDA which resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.6%. We continue to execute on our M2016 cost reduction initiatives to drag margin performance while at the same time managing through the dynamics of our global end markets. Now let's turn to Slide 10, for the third quarter total free cash flow was $71 million which was flat compared to the prior year. Our year-to-date free cash flow is 77 million is slightly better than where we were in this time last year. This performance puts us on track to achieve our updated free cash flow guidance which I\u2019ll discuss in a few slides. Let's turn to Slide 11, as I mentioned earlier we executed several capital markets transactions this quarter and among other things were reduced to dilution impact associated with our 7-7/8% percent convertible notes. First we issued $225 million of 6.25% notes that\u2019s mature in 2024. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repurchase 85 million aggregate principle amounts of our 7-7/8% convertible notes. Since the end of the quarter we repurchased an additional $25 million of the notes pursuant to a rule 10B51 plan. To date then we've repurchased $110 million of the notes at an average price of 162% of par. The premium paid over par reflects the market price of these notes which include the embedded auction values of security. Since the convertible has the strike price of $12 per share it's in the money which drives the significant premium. By issuing a new debt to execute these repurchases, we lowered the interest rates while simultaneously reducing the ongoing dilution impact of these notes by 44%. We plan to use the remaining net proceeds in the fourth quarter to purchase annuity to settle our German pension plan obligations. The recent foreign currency and discount rate decreases making annuity purchase in Germany more attractive from a U.S. dollar perspective that would allow us to permanently de-risk this portion of our pension liability. We do expect to recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $40 million to $50 million in the fourth quarter associated with the settlement of these pension obligations. Now let's move to Slide 12 which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchased program. As of the end of the quarter, we had repurchased $49 million of equity and equity-linked securities reflecting 2.3 million common shares and $19 million of 4% convertible notes. Although not shown on the slide since the end of the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million additional common shares under a 10b5-1 plan. So today we've actually now purchased 3.8 million common shares under the program. In total including all activity to-date in July, we've now repurchased nearly $70 million of equity and equity linked securities under the program of which almost three quarters is in the form of common equity, and we remain on track to complete the program by September 2016. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2015 outlook Slide 13. Based on the demand assumptions, Jay highlighted on Slide 5, our fiscal year 2015 sales guidance remained unchanged at a range of $3.5 billion to $3.55 billion. We now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 9.3% for 2015 compared to our previous range of 9.0% to 9.2%. We expect to drive this margin result largely through continued strong execution of M2016 initiatives. Implicit in this full year margin guidance is that we expect lower margins in Q4 than in the first nine months of the year. There are two drivers of this. First, we expect overall revenue to decline sequentially from Q3 due to the normal European summer holiday which always drives a revenue headwind in the fourth quarter. In addition, we received updated yearend liability valuations in September any adjustment required as a result of these valuations would be recorded in the fourth quarter and could impact margin performance. Nonetheless, we still believe the results point to an improved outlook for the year with our margin guidance now at approximately 9.3%. Driven by the improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance as well as from the impact of our equity and equity linked repurchase activity, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.40 to $1.50 for fiscal year 2015 which is an increase of $0.10 compared to our prior guidance. Our effective income tax guidance remains unchanged at approximately 15% for fiscal year 2015. As I have mentioned in prior quarters, we are generating positive earnings in the U.S. and certain European jurisdictions where we previously established valuations allowances against our deferred tax assets. We will continue to evaluate the positive and negative factors to determine whether there is a sufficient evidence to reverse these valuation allowances in future quarters. Finally as Jay mentioned earlier, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to approximately $110 million for 2015 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $100 million which means we're expecting back to back years of cash flow above the $100 million level. This guidance excludes the expected cash payment of approximately $90 million related to the German pension plan settlement. In the end, we're pleased that our continued strong performance is allowing us to again raise earnings and cash flow guidance. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide some closing remarks. Jay Craig : Thanks Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 14. In developing M2016, we identified key issues established and communicated measurable objective aligned the organization and are successfully executing against our plan. As you know our performance metrics include margin improvement, net debt reduction and revenue growth. We are on track to achieve all three and are committed to bring in home the plan next year, but for also hard to work on our strategy for beyond 2016. Our next three year plan will put more emphasis on executing opportunities for growth in our core and adjacent markets while remaining focused on expanding our margins and driving a balanced approach to capital allocation. We look forward to providing you a detailed review of that plan in our December Analyst Day Meeting. And now, we'll open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Brian Johnson : Can you just give us a broad sense of your China exposure? I think it's mostly off-highway, but just want to understand and also what you're seeing in that market vis-\u00e0-vis order rates, backlog et cetera. Jay Craig : Brian this is Jay. That's good question. Our business today is primarily of highway construction mining with some premium bus and coach axles. I think what we're seeing as stability in the bus and coach axle business with extreme weakness in the other segments of the markets implied in our Q4 guidance is than expected further step down in Q4 compared to Q3 in that of highway and construction business and something we typically see this time of the year seasonally but we don\u2019t expect that will see any recoveries soon in those end markets. Brian Johnson : So that's not -- but would you say it's bouncing along the bottom or further downside? Jay Craig : I would say it continues to step down bit-by-bit but quite frankly it's getting to be at such low volume levels, the impact to our guidance and the overall financial impact to Meritor it's becoming relatively insignificant. Brian Johnson : Second question, on the military side. While we wait for hopefully new awards, can you give us an update on FMTV and your expectations in the fiscal 2016? Jay Craig : Right now we are working with the prime contractor ash Oshkosh on this program trying to determine what production levels to expect in 2016. I think at this point we would say we don\u2019t see values changing too much in that period compared to 2015. Brian Johnson : And final question, how do you think about consolidation in the drive line industry? I guess a couple questions. One, do you see opportunities within the commercial and off-highway world? Do you see any potential tuck-ins? And three, what about the idea of kind of combining light vehicle axles and commercial vehicle axles in the same entity? Jay Craig : I can address the second question first obviously we've worked hard for a long time to become a commercial vehicle focused business and I would tell you a big part of the PACCAR wins we've had PACCAR has complemented to us, in fact I think you saw the comment about Christianson made in our Analyst Day, I'm being focused on commercial vehicles. So we're very pleased with that focus or at more importantly our customers are pleased that all of our capital and research and development goes to that area and we don\u2019t see a lot of synergies and overlap between the two as we've evaluated that over time. But as far as expansion within the commercial vehicle business as we had look to our next three year planning cycle that is something we're considering, we are looking at growth opportunities so I mentioned in my comments in the core which would be new geographies or new customers along with newer adjacencies for we think we can provide additional value to our customers and as we look at that growth we will consider certain what I would call bolt-on acquisitions that may help us expedite that growth. Brian Johnson : And just final question, quickly, I know I ask it every time. Any update on Meritor WABCO's participation in truck active safety, and ADAS, and can we look forward to any given that's increasing, given their braking requirements coming in, whether it's through the resale of active safety equipment or just higher spec brakes, is there any contribution we can expect over the next three years from that and, if so, how to dimension it? Jay Craig : We've seen very solid performance in Meritor WABCO participating obviously on the increasing value of the North America along with some increasing penetrations particularly collision avoidance systems and we're very pleased with the performance of that entity. I think it's a fairer expectation of ours it should be of our investors as we could see further penetration of those safety systems in the vehicles. Brian Johnson : But any way the dimension the impact on your equity income or your financials? Jay Craig : We're not forecasting that at this point. But certainly I think you can see some of the impact through our financial segments of the impact of non-consolidated joint ventures and the increasing income we're seeing from that. Kevin Nowlan : And Brain it's Kevin if you look we have filed Meritor WABCO's financial statements for last year because they were a material sub here over the last couple of years so you can actually see what our earnings are coming from that entity. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Please proceed. Neil Frohnapple : Wanted to ask a little more on the front axle business win at PACCAR. Our channel actually picked up that your front axles were already installed on a meaningful percentage of PACCAR's production in the second quarter. So would you expect the ramp-up to greater than 50% share to be even faster than the rear axles, now that you have a standard positioning? Just really trying to get at when you would expect to hit the $40 million revenue run rate? Kevin Nowlan : Neil this is Kevin. Yes you are exactly right. We did start to see the ramp up of this happen early on the year as PACCAR assets to ramp up and advance of the LTA being executed. So as we look ahead to the $40 million of revenue that we\u2019re expecting at run rate, I would tell you we're expecting that already two-thirds of that is hitting in year 2015 and it really started already in our second fiscal quarter. Neil Frohnapple : And then, Kevin, revenue from the front axle business win generate incremental EBITDA margins within your stated 15% to 20% conversion rate range you had previously provided? Kevin Nowlan : We don\u2019t give specific margin guidance on any particular program, but I think it's a fair assumption on any of our new business wins to think about it being in that general zip code. I think that's the fair way to think about it. Neil Frohnapple : And then just one final one. Aftermarket and trailer segment EBITDA margins, very impressive in the quarter and up year-over-year again. That sounds like it was primarily driven due to continued execution of the M2016 initiatives. But you do have a tough comp in the fourth quarter versus last year. Do you guys think you can exceed last year's margin, given the momentum you built for the segment? Kevin Nowlan : I don't think we're prepared to give specific margin guidance on each segment in the quarter, but I think if you look the last four quarters in a row now we've generated 12% to 14% EBITDA margins in that segment and that's not an accident. I think the 14% numbers that you saw on a couple of quarters had someone timers in there and as you think about the 13% or 13.3% we generated in the quarter which really didn't have any real type of one timers that's probably more of which you should expect of the run rate of this business at the current revenue level. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick Archambault : Just following up on that last question firstly, what was -- sorry, you said there was some one-off items that impacted the fourth quarter last year in trailer. Can you just remind us of what those were? Kevin Nowlan : Well I guess I was speaking to like the 14% we generated a quarter ago where we had some of those FX tailwinds the one-time foreign exchange hedges that generated some gains, so I think we've had a couple of guidance drove us with 14% numbers, but I think you should expect something in that 13% zip code is about the right margin for the business right now. Patrick Archambault : And the liability true-up, I guess in September, can you tell us a little bit more about that? Is that something that you've kind of factored in a base amount, and you're being a little cautious because you don't know what the variance is, or how specifically are you -- because I'm not familiar with that particular issue? Kevin Nowlan : I mean if you look at the last couple of quarters, we have seen some liability true-up happen to us at yearend particularly around some of our legacy liabilities. And unfortunately last year we saw a pretty meaningful step up in our legacy liability although we saw some big upsets to that as well. So as we think about our forecast for Q4, we are assuming a few million dollars of potential liability adjustments as part of our planning process, but it remains to be seeing what the actual valuations are going to come in at. Patrick Archambault : And what are -- is that like interest rate or discount rate-driven, or what kind of factors affect that? Kevin Nowlan : I mean for example last year when we had some of our asbestos exposure, it really related to the forecast of our tenured liability based on actual experience that we were incurring in the current year. So as we just looked ahead we're being cautious I think and assuming that there is some risk that we could have a few million dollar of true-up probably nothing material like we saw last year given where we sit today. But the potential exit that there could be a few million dollars and that's what we planned for thus for in our guidance. Patrick Archambault : And last one from me, I guess all my questions are on accounting liability things, but just the German annuity that you are pouring some funding into, can you just remind us what are the tax implications and the earnings implications of funding that plan with that annuity? Kevin Nowlan : So obviously we've issued that and we're using some cash on the balance sheet to basically fund that transaction. I think as you look at the impact of this on a going forward basis beside from the fact that we'll have bit of interest expense for the portion of that it uses debt we'll see an EBITDA improvement heading into next year probably in the $2.5 million to $3 million range. So that would be a partial offset to the interest expense that we're seeing. And then I think as we -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll have a non-cash charge that will take associated with some of the actuarial true-up that we have to flush through the P&L that will be a one-time non-cash charge that we will take. And then finally one thing that we'll be cognizant enough and we're not sure the impact yet as we take away that headwind of the German liability and the cost of that liability going forward, it has the potential to impact the way we look at our valuation allowances in Germany in terms of assessing the positive and negative evidence of whether or not we need to reverse the valuation allowances there and can start using those tax attributes that remains to be seen. Patrick Archambault : But if there's not really a cash tax shield from funding that thing like there would be in the U.S., right? Kevin Nowlan : Correct. Patrick Archambault : And then so -- and then you have said, and you said it again today, well, multiple times, I think, that you're going to likely write up your deferred tax assets. So we should think of modeling something closer to the statutory rate next year onwards, is that kind of a safe modeling assumption, in the absence of more detail? Kevin Nowlan : I don\u2019t think we said that anything is likely. We're still assessing the positive and negative evidence. We've had obviously here a couple of quarters of positive earnings in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions in Western Europe, if those trends continue, if the potential exist that we could some of those assets being reversed or those valuation allowances being reversed, later this year or into some time in 2016 and I think we'll be prepared to give you that guidance at the end of the quarter when we get into the November earnings call. Operator : The next question comes from line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan : Can you just remind us the percent of sales that you have today in China and how they're structured? I believe they're through joint ventures, just so I understand the earnings? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, in China I mean you look a year ago our China earnings were-- our revenue was about 150 million of revenues to down 35% this year was same. We're going to be in $100 million zip code. That\u2019s predominantly conducted through a 60-40 joint venture where we own 60% and our JV partner own 40%. There's two JVs there, but the bigger of the two is with XCMG. Colin Langan : And then regarding the PACCAR win, can you give a sense of how your capacity is today to handle that, because market's pretty strong in North America. What kind of capacity are you running at and are there going to be any challenges with all the new wins coming on line? Jay Craig : I think, we feel confident meeting what we estimate as the demand currently in North America with current penetration we see including the incremental business with PACCAR. I would say we wouldn't commit to that type of business without having some surety that we could deliver on that without incurring additional expediting costs or other costs and just as importantly that we should expect PACCAR wanted to do some due diligence on that before committing to us. So I think all of us feel very comfortable where we are at and I think it's displayed in the actual quarter performance you are not seeing premium costs impact our ability for match the ramp up in volumes in North America. Colin Langan : Can you remind us on the pensions, the impact, the mortality when we measure at yearend? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, this is Kevin when we first started looking at this a year ago and look at the Society of Actuaries tables, as they were published in the exposure draft. We model that through our liabilities and thought the impact would be about $124 million on our liability however as we-- as the final rules about how to apply the tables were published we realized we are able to apply some of our actual experience to modify the base line tables that were provided by the Society Actuaries. So in the end our experience defers from that, that was published by the Society of Actuaries. The end result for U.S., we think is going to be less than a $25 million impact on our liability at the end of the year versus the 124, so we thought about a year ago in this time. So less than 25 million we think at this point. Colin Langan : And lastly, any update on your M2016, $500 million sales target? Where do you stand now with the recent win? Kevin Nowlan : We will update that in November but this win the $40 million PACCAR business win is incremental to what you have seeing before. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kristine Kubacki with Avondale Partners. Please proceed. Kristine Kubacki : I know you guys look at fiscal year a little bit different, but want to talk a little about the North American market, and obviously we're at very high levels. Where do you see that going, in terms of are we at peak? There's a lot of debate in the market. And would it be a bad thing to kind of come down from these really, really high levels? It sounds like you're not incurring any premium cost, kudos to you, but would it be a little bit more comfortable for you if the market cooled off just a little bit in North America next year? Jay Craig : Well, as I mentioned in my comments is a typically foresee this high volume level continuing through the calendar year, that we have discuss previously through this calendar year. Certainly we have to start to see orders pick up a bit for to continued this, these very strong levels through next fiscal year but will be providing our details outlook next quarter in conjunction with our guidance for fiscal '16. As far as whether it's a good thing, it cools off to that as you commented and I did-- we are able to perform very, very well at these volumes. I think we have because of the make-up of our hourly work force with a meaningful percentage being contract labors. We are able to flex sound quiet effectively, so I think this is pretty broad range where this market can be very profitable for us. So if it comes down a bit certainly we will miss those volumes. I wouldn't mislead you but I think we'd still have very profitable business in North America. Kristine Kubacki : And then kind of the same question in Europe, but kind of the reverse of, as it -- it seems like it's a little bit more slower ramping there, but are there any things as we watch out in that market, as it seems like things continue to get better over there, are you anywhere near how you think about operationally ramping up there? Are there any challenges as that market continues to accelerate? Jay Craig : I think we feel good about Brazil we did have a pre-buyer little of year ago now that we actually hit it very well on it and we lost it about one quarter but again its very few if any premium cost can be had its deal with that our response of that spike volumes. Right now I think what you are saying in that market is just for slowly building confidence and increased orders, so it looks like it could be a slow ramp up which obviously we could respond to very effectively. And also we're just very pleased with the profitability as far as European business overall. Operator : That concludes today's Q&A session I'd now like to turn the call back over to Carl for any closing remarks. Jay Craig : This is Jay Craig. I just want to thank everyone for joining the call and for your continued interest in Meritor and more importantly I want to thank to Meritor employees just for their efforts this quarter and delivering outstanding results for our investors. Our results in the third quarter are really testimony but our focus on execution and revenue growth is working, we're committed to delivering increased shareholder value by driving margin improvement and reducing debt and positioning our core businesses for profitable growth. I look forward to either seeing you before the next quarter or speaking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, have a great day.",

Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Let's turn to slide three. With the second full year of M2016 now complete, we are on track to achieve the financial targets for our three-year plan. When we launched M2016, we were a different company than we are today. Margin is up, debt is down, and we have established important new relationships with customers around the world like PACCAR in North America, Scania in Europe, Daimler in India, and DAF in South America, among others. We've also dramatically improved our execution. We've converted on up-cycles in Europe and North America through excellent management of our operating and product costs. In fact, several times during the month of September, we've produced the most axles per day in the history of the company with no degradation to safety, quality, delivery or cost. These changes in our business are enabling us to significantly offset the unfavorable effects of market challenges, particularly in Brazil and China, and in our Defense business, which historically have been strong earnings contributors to our bottom line. Looking at the 2015 financial highlights, we had a strong close. We beat our EBITDA margin guidance by 20 basis points and exceeded the top end of our EPS range. Year-over-year adjusted diluted EPS was up 52%, demonstrating a solid bottom line return to Meritor's shareholders. Also during the year, we earned new business that puts us on track to meet our revenue target for our M2016 program. And we've already exceeded our net debt reduction goal. Keep in mind, this was accomplished even after the repurchase of $55 million of common equity, representing a buyback of 4% percent of our total outstanding shares. In addition, we've refinanced more than $100 million of convertible debt that will also mitigate share dilution going forward. As you can see from the walk on slide four, our margin has increased 230 basis points since fiscal year 2013, putting us only 50 basis points away from achieving our M2016 EBITDA margin goal. This reflects our dedicated focus on material cost reductions and labor and burden performance combined with pricing, which more appropriately reflects our value proposition. I want to give credit to our global workforce for this result. They remain keenly focused on our objectives and day-to-day execution despite the volatile market factors that were in play and has paid off. Let me also take a moment to recognize more than 300 Meritor employees who have served or are currently serving in the United States Military. With today being Veterans Day, we want to tell them how much we appreciate their service. Now, as we look at fiscal 2016, we're confident we'll achieve a 10% EBITDA margin target. We believe our new business wins and ongoing management of operating costs will offset the full-year effect of unfavorable foreign exchange and the softening in the North American Class 8 truck market. Looking at slide five, we've taken steps to reduce net debt by approximately $500 million over the last several years. This was accomplished through proceeds from the Eaton settlement, the sale of our Brazilian joint venture, and free cash flow generation. As we look ahead, we expect to continue driving improvement in our credit profile as we strive toward our target of having BB credit metrics. This is part of our strategy to deliver long-term value to our shareholders that represents a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. On slide six, we highlight new business awarded in fiscal 2015. With PACCAR, we are now supplying rear axles in North America, Australia, and Brazil. We've achieved close to a 50% share of rears in North America, almost a full year before our initial expectations that we communicated to you back in January. You'll remember, we also have standard positioning for front steer axles. At full run rate, we expect revenue from fronts and rears to be approximately $190 million. New this quarter we have four additional wins to add to our revenue stream. In Defense, as announced in August, we'll supply wheel ends for approximately 17,000 JLTVs to be managed by Oshkosh over an eight-year timeframe. We're also supplying Navistar with all-wheel drive components including T-cases for approximately 2,300 medium tactical vehicles for the Afghanistan National Security Force. Deliveries begin in January of 2016 and conclude in 2019. Beginning in 2016, we'll supply rear drive tag and front steer axles and brakes to MCI in connection with the purchase of almost 8,800 commuter coaches by New Jersey's public transportation corporation. This is a six-year delivery schedule. And in Asia Pacific, we have a new axle and brake program with a major OE. While we don't plan to announce more details at this time, this customer award supports our new broad range of fully-dressed axle products in the region that offer customers greater efficiency, localization, and cost savings. This award is a good example of how technology developed in our engineering centers of excellence in North America, Europe, and India is being applied to meet the needs of other regions. Our well-developed infrastructure will be a key enabler of future business growth. We expect that the total value of these newly announced wins from the fourth quarter are going to approximate $45 million at a full annual run rate. Let's look at slide seven. The last time we updated our progress against our revenue target was this past February. At that time, we were $300 million towards our $500 million goal. Today, we are at $385 million towards that goal, taking into account the new business wins we've been awarded since that time. On the right side of the chart, you'll see that we expect $275 million to be in our P&L in 2016, exceeding the target we set for ourselves. And remember, these numbers are market-adjusted. This puts us close to 80% of the way towards achieving our $500 million revenue target. We are committed to engineering and manufacturing products that are the first choice of drivers, fleets, and vocational equipment operators, and troops around the world. Now, let's take a look at our market outlook on slide eight. We knew the peak volumes in North America would eventually decline, and we're now starting to see some signs of softening for 2016. Coming off a 328,000 unit market in 2015, we're projecting Class 8 production of 275,000 to 290,000 units in our fiscal year, which equates to approximately 265,000 to 270,000 units for the calendar year. Still a solid market, but down year-over-year. We believe medium-duty volumes will be slightly down, while trailers will remain flat. Economic indicators are showing positive signs in Western Europe for slight growth in 2016. We're continuing to see registrations increasing and freight fundamentals improve. We believe our markets in China will continue to be challenged in 2016. The off-highway sector is still weak, while bus and coach appears to be stable. India looks to be improving and we're increasing our outlook in that region by just over 9%. We're confident India offers growth opportunities for us as conditions there continue to improve. As for Brazil, we're not yet seeing signs of recovery from the current recession. We're expecting another 16% step-down year-over-year to approximately 75,000 units, driven by a variety of economic factors and ongoing low consumer confidence. In a minute, Kevin will talk about our guidance for 2016. The most important point is that even though we expect revenue to be slightly down this fiscal year, continued performance and increasing market share gains are offsetting the instability in the markets. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results, and then I'll take you through our 2016 guidance. Overall, as Jay said, the key take-away from our results is that we continue to generate improved margins and increasing bottom line EPS and we expect that trend to continue as we march toward achievement of our M2016 objectives. Let's turn to slide 9, where you'll see our fourth quarter income statement from continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $853 million in the quarter, down nearly 9% from last year. The lower revenue was primarily driven by weaker currencies in Europe and Brazil relative to the U.S. dollar. Weaker end markets in Brazil and China also contributed to the revenue decline, although that weakness was largely offset by the strong Class 8 truck market in North America. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 12.7% in the current quarter, compared to 15% a year ago. You may recall that last year we had a $15 million one-time benefit related to changes we made to our retiree medical plans and an $8 million benefit relating to a favorable resolution of a warranty contingency. If we exclude the impact of these benefits on last year's margin, our current year gross margin actually expanded by 20 basis points. This improvement was driven by material, labor and burden performance, and pricing actions. SG&A was approximately 6.6% of sales in the most recent quarter, an improvement of $24 million from a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a $20 million charge associated with the year-end valuation of asbestos liabilities. Also, we had lower incentive compensation accruals in the current quarter. Next, you'll see charges we took for pension settlement losses and asset impairments. Consistent with our strategy to derisk the balance sheet, we executed agreements with insurance companies to purchase annuities that completely settled $107 million in book value of pension plan obligations. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a $59 million pre-tax loss in the quarter. The loss was substantially non-cash and relates primarily to the acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses already reflected in book equity. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the U.S. Army awarded a new contract to Oshkosh Corporation for the production of the JLTV. While we are pleased to supply wheel-ends to Oshkosh for this program, our revenue will be significantly less than if they had been awarded to another OE that was going to utilize our ProTec independent suspension. Based on sales expectations for this and other currently awarded programs, we believe the fair value of our defense business is less than its carrying value. Therefore, we've recorded $17 million of asset impairments, of which $15 million related to goodwill. Moving down the income statement, you'll see that we booked a tax benefit in the quarter of $18 million. This includes $16 million of valuation allowance reversals relating to our deferred tax assets. As we have been indicating for several quarters, we are generating profits in various jurisdictions across the globe, where we have booked valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. We now have enough positive evidence, including sustained earnings in Germany, Italy, Mexico and Sweden, that enabled us to reverse valuation allowances in these countries. When you adjust for the large non-recurring items that I noted, you'll see that our adjusted income from continuing operations was $37 million, up $2 million from last year. That translates to $0.39 per diluted share, up $0.04 from 2014. Overall, this was another strong quarter for us. As we've demonstrated during this and every other quarter in fiscal year 2015, we are successfully executing M2016 initiatives, which is allowing us to drive consistently improving results over time. Slide 10 details fourth quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $650 million, down 11% from the same period last year. Weaker currencies relative to the U.S. dollar drove most of this decline. Production in our North America truck business was stronger year-over-year. However, this was more than offset by lower production levels in Brazil and China. Segment EBITDA was $45 million, a decrease of $8 million compared to the prior year. Segment EBITDA margin was 6.9% in the quarter, down slightly from last year. These decreases were primarily driven by lower revenue. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $231 million, down 4% from last year. This decline was caused entirely by currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $37 million, up 9% over last year and segment EBITDA margin was 16%, an increase of 180 basis points over fiscal year 2014. This improvement was driven by strong performance of our M2016 initiative. Let's move to slide 11, which compares our actual results for the full year 2015 to 2014. As you can see, we expanded EBITDA margins by 120 basis points even as revenue declined by 7%. Again, our focus on M2016 initiative is the driving force behind our improved financial performance. This was achieved on revenue levels that were down more than $250 million due almost entirely to weaker foreign currencies. Despite this, we increased our adjusted EBITDA by $20 million over last year. As you can see, our diligence around managing cost resulted in SG&A expense decreasing $35 million this year, excluding last year's one-time legal fee recovery from Eaton. Specifically, this is the combination of lower legacy cost, lower incentive compensation accruals, and overall discipline around cost management. You can also see the performance we're generating above and beyond SG&A. While volume was down modestly year-over-year, our efforts directed at pricing, material cost reductions and labor and burden performance contributed more than $26 million to our margin improvement in 2015. We expect these self-help initiative, which represent the foundation of M2016, to continue in the upcoming year. It's also worth noting that the improvement in EBITDA is falling straight to our bottom line as you can see in our reported EPS. While we expanded our EBITDA margin by 14% over last year, diluted adjusted earnings per share expanded by 52% year-over-year to $1.55 in 2015. This was driven by improvement in margins, as well as lower interest expense and lower tax expense. And finally, we had another strong year in free cash flow. The earnings improvement we're generating is comprised of real cash earnings. In 2015, we generated $18 million of free cash flow. This includes $94 million in voluntary contributions we made to fund annuity purchases that fully settled our German and Canadian pension obligations. Excluding this, we generated $112 million in free cash flow. Now let's move to slide 12, which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $25 million of common equity, totaling 1.9 million shares. Although not shown on the slide, after the quarter ended, we repurchased an additional 1.8 million common shares in October, pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan. That means, to-date, we've repurchased 6 million common shares under the program. In total, including the common equity repurchases in October, we've now executed nearly $94 million of equity and equity-linked buybacks under our $210 million program, of which approximately 80% has been in the form of common equity. We remain on track to complete the entire program by September 2016. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 13. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted on slide 8, we expect sales to be approximately $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, down slightly compared to 2015. As shown in our sales walk, we expect our new business wins to just about offset revenue declines from the full-year effect of a stronger U.S. dollar and the softening of the Class 8 truck market. With that revenue outlook, we are confident we'll achieve our margin target of 10%. The 50-basis-point margin improvement will be driven by the continued consistency and execution that we've demonstrated throughout fiscal 2015. We also expect to improve adjusted earnings per share to a range of $1.60 to $1.70 in 2016, driven by higher earnings and lower shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. With regard to our reported adjusted diluted earnings per share, we currently are not reflecting the real cash impact from all of our net operating loss carryforwards. Due to the valuation allowance reversals in various European jurisdictions and Mexico, we expect to generate a $0.10 to $0.15 per share benefit in 2016 not reflected in our reported adjusted EPS. And with the potential for valuation allowance reversals in other countries in the future, the amount of the benefit not reflected in our EPS could increase quite significantly over time. We want to ensure that you have visibility into the real cash impact of these tax attributes. We'll provide more clarity into how we intend to do this at our Analyst Day in December. Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $115 million. The takeaway here again is that our earnings generation is translating to real cash flow. Based on this outlook for FY 2016, we believe we are positioned to achieve all three of the M2016 financial targets that we introduced in 2013. And as we deliver on our financial commitments this year, it means that from an income statement, balance sheet and cash flow perspective, we'll have positioned this company to really capitalize on meaningful growth opportunities as we look beyond 2016. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 14. The main takeaways from today's call are that we delivered another year of improved financial performance. And as a result, we are confident we will achieve our transformational M2016 financial objectives. In doing so, we believe the company will be better positioned for revenue and earnings growth in the future. We remain committed to our current three-year plan even as we look forward to introducing you to the details of our next one. We now have momentum going into the last year of our M2016 plan, and everyone is excited for the next step in our future. As we look ahead, that plan will shift our emphasis to growth as we continue to focus on business strategies that deliver value to our shareholders. We look forward to taking you through this plan at our Analyst Day in New York on December 10. Now let's take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. And your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Two questions. We were surprised pleasantly by the strong margin in Aftermarket. It looks like your highest quarterly margin ever and close to 200 basis points above last year, which is also a strong close for you. Can you help us understand the drivers of that, the seasonality around that, if any? Were there any sort of one-time cost saves in it? And maybe just kind of, is Aftermarket \u2013 or on the other hand, is Aftermarket seeing some of the fruits of M2016 perhaps later than CB, where your margins have held up despite the volume headwinds? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Brian. This is Kevin Nowlan. I'll take that question. But you're right, we had a really strong quarter for the Aftermarket & Trailer segment at 16%, and a portion of it was driven by some things that are unique to the fourth quarter. We normally have some year-end accrual adjustments and that might have contributed a couple million dollars for things like ICP. But the bulk of the performance or the results were driven by performance. Material, labor and burden performance and pricing actions is really what drove the 16%. And so, as I think about margins for that segment going forward, as we look ahead to 2016, I think you should expect it to be more in the 14% to 15% range as we look forward at these types of revenue levels. Now, having said that, you had asked a question about seasonality. Keep in mind, Q1 is typically the low point for the business given fewer selling days in the quarter. So we would expect it to be a little lower in the first quarter. But for a full year 2016 basis, we're expecting 14% to 15% margin, which is a little higher than what we've guided to in the past. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a follow up to that. Material, is that supply reengineering or is it just these are made of steel and steel prices have fallen? You don't necessarily have to pass that through like you do with OEMs and fleet customers. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's less to do with the first piece that you mentioned, reengineering, and more to do with material performance initiative, which is improving our cost structure overall, as well as there is a little bit of a tailwind we get from steel index improvement on a year-over-year basis. But I'd say it's a healthy mix of both, as well as labor and burden performance initiatives and pricing actions. It's a combination of all those things. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question, back in commercial vehicle, two maybe kind of offsetting issues or kind of questions just around market position within North America and Class 8. On the one hand, one of your \u2013 so first subquestion is, one of your competitors ran into supplier issues with Class 8 and blamed that for their loss of market share. Did you benefit from that competitor's loss of market share in North America? And then, second question, one of your major customers, Daimler, is producing more axles in-house. How should we think about them using that capacity in light of the Class 8 build decline that you're forecasting? And are they going to try to keep that full perhaps by incenting some of their fleet customers to choose the in-house axle and how would that affect Meritor? So two issues, kind of gain of share on the competitive supplier issue and then kind of in-house competitor at Daimler. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Hey, Brian. This is Jay. Good morning. Yeah. On your first question, certainly, as I mentioned in my comments, we had an excellent year of execution. I think, most importantly, our customers would say we executed virtually flawlessly. So, we did see some opportunities to fill in some gaps in the market from various suppliers, but I think it still is a longer-term trend of us winning business. And so, I guess, to answer an unasked question, do we see a step back, because certain suppliers will be coming back online, not of any meaningful amount. We think these revenue gains have been \u2013 market share gains have been of a more permanent nature. And I really give credit to our team, especially from the supply chain and manufacturing side, for just doing an excellent job. On the second question on Daimler, this resurrection issue that was earlier in the year, we've seen our penetration stabilize, as we spoken to earlier, and we expect that environment to continue with stable penetrations going forward and have that understanding with our customer. We are still the majority supplier of Class 8 drive axles to Freightliner and other Daimler products, and we expect to continue that position for the long term. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the good results. A couple from me. I guess, maybe just more detail on the self-help. I think one of the things that pleasantly surprised us is how you've been able to maintain the margin guidance for M2016 of 10% under significantly more difficult volume scenarios than you had initially envisioned. And so, just as we think about bridging the final piece to that 10%, where is the lowest hanging fruit? I think you had outlined the plan which had some restructuring, labor and burden benefits as well as I think redesign and maybe even price downs for some of your own suppliers. How should we think about the stuff that's \u2013 the biggest levers that are left to pull? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Good morning, Patrick, this is Jay. Good question. As we look at it, I would say it's just more the same. I mean, as we look at the pillars of the margin improvement, you can look at purchasing cost reductions, labor and burden cost performance improvements, pricing improvements. As we look at this last year at the M2016 program, I would say, those are the three main pillars again. And as you would expect, we have 12 to 24-month pipelines on the cost reduction efforts and the pricing initiatives that we review and make certain we have all the steps to ensure that we have execution on those. And that's why you're hearing us going out with confidence today. We'll achieve those targets even in what most people would call a very challenging market environment globally for our industry. We feel we're doing an excellent job of controlling the initiatives that we can. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So, okay, that's important. So, it does seem like there's quite a bit of visibility on some of these factors. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Internally, a lot of visibility. Again, I think, as you would expect, given the past performance we've shown over the last few years, we have very detailed pipeline reviews and reports and make sure the teams are aligned to achieve the objectives. And the other item I should mention is, I think we're starting to get the favorable benefit of the new wins in the market that are attributable to the significant new product launches we're bringing to the market, our excellent delivery, and quality performance. We're starting to see meaningful share gains that you see in our guidance are offsetting a fair bit, if not almost all of the headwinds year-over-year. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then, are those accretive from a margin perspective relative to old programs at a variable cost level? Or is that just kind of operating leverage? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think \u2013 Patrick, it's Kevin. The way to think about it is we expect to contribute at our normal type of 15% to 20% contribution on any typical new dollar of revenue and those new business wins, I think on average, are no different. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And one last one for me. Forgive me if you guys have gone over this, but your planned measurement data is still in September, is that correct? And if so, can you just give us a visibility on pension expense since you guys are usually ahead of the curve on that? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : In terms of \u2013 you're right, where at September year-end, and that's when we do our valuation adjustments. I don't think we're prepared to give new pension income guidance for next year at this point. But I think from our funded status, you should expect that our pension under-funded position is going to be just over $100 million as opposed to what has been in prior years, it's been upwards of $0.5 billion, just given some of our de-risking strategy that we've executed. And then, we'll provide you a little bit more color on your specific question in December at the Analyst Day. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Can I just ask that you guys take down your discount rate? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I cannot comment on that at the moment, but you should expect that we follow the same methodology we always do, which is looking at AA corporates and what they did on a year-over-year basis. It's not a significant move, I would tell you, on a year-over-year basis in our discount rates. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Well, I'll let you guys give us the specifics a little later. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give any color on the Commercial Truck margins? They're down a bit, looked like almost like a 24% decremental in the quarter. And your comments about Aftermarket, does that \u2013 any color on how we should think about the Commercial margins into next year? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I mean, the real driver of the Commercial Truck margins has been revenue. And so, if you think about that on a decremental basis, I think on a year-over-year basis, it's actually more like 10%. And again, our typical contribution is more in the 15% to 20% range. And so, as we've seen revenue come down for the reasons we talked about, FX being the primary driver, we've been able to mitigate some of that impact through our performance initiatives. So, it's just been a bigger revenue decline in the Truck segment, which has had a bigger impact on the margin, but performance is still mitigating that. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And I mean, in terms of, you've indicated Aftermarket will be up \u2013 I got them and I have a hard time to do the math. Does that imply that there should \u2013 do we still need to see Commercial Truck margins to be up or can it be flat next year and you can hit your overall 10% target? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think I would just say that, overall, we're driving toward 10% from a full company basis and I know there's a lot of focus on the Aftermarket & Trailer in the performance that it delivered. And I would tell you that if you look at the full year performance of that business at 14%, we're expecting to see even a little bit of improvement into 2016 on that. But you should expect for the whole company to be up 50 basis points, we need some contribution coming from really both segments. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And can you give color on the tax guidance? It's holding at 15%, but you did have some reversals of the valuation allowance, thus, you expect more to come? Wouldn't that imply that your effective GAAP tax rate would start going up? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It would and that effective tax rate actually already contemplates the fact that there are some non-cash tax expenses in that number. So, if I look ahead to 2016, and we expect those jurisdictions where we just reversed the valuation allowances to generate income tax expense in the upcoming year north of $10 million, that's part of our effective tax rate guidance of 15%. If you were to strip out the fact that that $10 million or so is actually non-cash, an equivalent tax rate on more of that cash basis would be more like 10%. So, we are seeing that headwind in the 15% guidance number that we're providing you. And the cash basis is actually something lower. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But I mean, if you have further allowances next year which are \u2013 could that \u2013 there's risk to the rate going up next year if you have further ones again. Is that right? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Absolutely. So, if that happens, we would have a \u2013 let's say, for instance, we had a jurisdiction like the U.S. where we have a lot of deferred tax assets and large valuation allowances. If we reverse those valuation allowances, we would generate a substantial one-time book income tax benefit. And then we would start booking tax expense through the EPS line on a going-forward basis on future earnings. But we would continue to recognize the cash benefit associated with monetizing those deferred tax assets, we think into the early part of next decade. So, we think there's a real substantial benefit for us to continue to realize whether those valuation allowances are reversed or not. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Thanks, Colin. Operator : Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. This is Irina on for Brett Hoselton. I had a couple of questions. Today's 2016 EBITDA margin guidance, 10%, how does that relate to your longer-term anticipated margin targets which you were going to introduce in December? Should we view this kind of as a directional sign of what we can expect going forward, or is this just 2016 guidance, the same as before, 10%, and you are not ready to provide longer-term targets yet? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Irina. This is Jay. Good question. Again, we're extremely proud and confident that we will achieve that 10% margin guidance. As I've said earlier, we feel confident we have the programs in place to achieve that. As far as for the outlook beyond that, that's what we'll be addressing in a month from now in December, so about four weeks from now, and be talking through that in some detail. I think, as we've said earlier, we think there's still opportunities but we're not ready to, specifically, to mention how much those are, but we think there's still opportunities to increase margin in the years to come. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. That's helpful. And then your North American Class 8 outlook appears a little conservative relative to the latest update from the industry. How do you view your initial guidance? Would you say you're on the conservative side, right in line with what you're seeing or hard to imagine, but perhaps maybe you've been optimistic? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we feel we're shooting it pretty straight at some broader range than we typically give just because of the recent volatility in the market. So we've given a little broader range. Obviously, the most important thing is it supports our revenue guidance. So we feel that range is appropriate for what we've guided for the total revenue for 2016. As we look at that and look at the market factors, there are obviously, a lot of positive market factors. The fleets are still extremely profitable. The utilization rates are very high. Some of the negatives are the fleet age is coming down to more historic norms, and the used truck prices have also declined. I think the main thing we look at, like everybody is, the order data. And if we continue, if there's a trend that continues that occurred in October, where the orders for October were below the five-year average, it would put us towards the lower end of that range or put pressure on that. And if the orders over the next few months come in at or above that five-year average, it would put us towards the upper end of the range or above it. So that's what we're watching closely over the next few months. But I think we feel we're shooting it pretty straight, as we said today. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much for that detail. Very helpful. One last follow-on question on that. In terms of your capacity utilization, I know prior to the restructuring efforts a few years back, we discussed that at 275,000 units for the industry, 270,000 units, you would still be able to utilize your capacity quite effectively. Now that you are looking for a calendar year outlook that is a little bit below that 260,000 units, 270,000 units, how do you feel, with, of course, the latest actions taken internally, how do you feel in terms of your capacity utilization at these lower production rates? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we feel good about it. I think if you look at one of the charts Kevin covered on slide 13, you can see we have new business wins of almost $175 million coming in that we feel go a long way towards offsetting the expected market decline here in North America. So we think that utilization could still run quite high through 2016 as we bring on that new business. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Congratulations on an excellent quarter. Very well-executed year, guys. Congratulations. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Irina. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. And congrats on a great quarter. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Just to clarify, the EPS guidance does not include any equity repurchases, correct? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It includes those that we've executed today. So it includes the $20 million that we executed in the month of October, but nothing looking forward beyond that. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So that would be all upside of the current $1.60 to $1.70 guidance? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's correct. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then the medium-duty outlook for North America of a 6% to 10% decline seems to be a little bit more bearish than other component suppliers or industry forecasters are projecting for next year. Are you guys seeing weakness currently, or are you just taking a more conservative view just based on what's transpiring in the cost market? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we're maybe more at the conservative side of the spectrum, but remember also that has a much smaller impact on us. Our exposure to the medium-duty is primarily through Navistar where freight \u2013 because freightliner tends to be virtually 100% insourced on that product. So we tend to be less sensitive to that market movement, far less sensitive than Class 8. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you very much, indeed. Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli. Please go ahead. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just a few questions. Maybe to follow-up to Pat's question on margins for 2016; slide 13, the sales walk is helpful for fiscal 2016. Could we maybe run through an EBITDA walk as well in terms of the margin impact from some of the revenue drivers for 2016? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I mean, clearly you can see what our expectations are as it relates to revenue with revenue slightly down and you would expect that and we would expect that, overall, revenue is not going to be a positive contributor for EBITDA performance in the year, which just tells you that where we're expecting to see the EBITDA improve on a year-over-year basis and where margins improve is really coming from our performance initiatives : material performance, labor and burden performance, continued discipline around cost management including our legacy costs, all of those things are the types of things that we expect to continue to drive. And remember, the last two years, we've driven 230 basis points of improvement with revenue down. And so what we're suggesting this year is, hey, we are expecting to see another challenging market just like we've seen in the last couple of years. But once again, we're expecting to drive the same types of performance to improve our margins 50 basis points in the year. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful. And then as we think about the new business that you've been winning \u2013 and maybe it's a little bit early to talk about fiscal 2017. But any way of how to think about the incremental new business contribution from what you've won to-date, roughly speaking, for 2017? Trying to think about your kind of growth profile outside of the markets. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : What I would say is, I mean, where we stand right now, obviously, we've indicated that we're going to have achieved $275 million of the $385 million of new business wins in the 2016 P&L, which just tells you that the other $110 million or so is coming after 2016. Not prepared to provide any more specific detail than that as we look to what years those hit, 2017, 2018, et cetera. But we would expect to provide more color on that at Analyst Day in December in terms of what our revenue outlook is as we look beyond 2016. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful. And then just a quick last point of clarification. I think earlier on the pension, you mentioned about $100 million in liability. Is that global and do you maybe have the rough split between the U.S. pension and the global pension plans? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's global. That's global. And it's predominantly \u2013 the underfunded position is predominantly in the U.S. We're actually overfunded a little bit in the United Kingdom on a U.S. GAAP basis. But on a blended basis, we're a little bit over $100 million underfunded globally. And you'll see those specific numbers when we file our 10-K which is slated to go out I think about a week from today. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. That's all I have. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much for your questions, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes your Q&A time for now. I'd now like to turn the call to Mr. Jay Craig for the closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for joining the call today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact Carl. We look forward to seeing you in December and especially looking forward to rolling out our next strategic plan. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining in today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Carl, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us today. It was great seeing you at our Analyst Day back in December. Let's turn to slide 3 and talk about the highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016. We had another strong financial quarter overall. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.4% reflects a 40 basis point improvement year-over-year, which further demonstrates the sustainability of the performance we have shown over the past 12 quarters. Also, at the end of the last calendar year, we are very pleased to announce an additional piece of business in our growing relationship with PACCAR. Starting on January 1 of this year, Meritor is now in standard position for rear axles on all linehaul Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks with our 14X product, as well as drivelines. Just 18 months ago, we were at approximately 12% penetration with this customer. As of December, we were over 50%. It has been a significant and successful ramp-up that we expect to continue to drive increased penetrations throughout this year. As we told you at Analyst Day, we have now achieved $435 million toward our M2016 goal of $500 million in new business. This puts us close to 90% of the way toward achieving our revenue target. We are proud of this accomplishment because it validates the success of our strategy to increase customer focus and execute a more aggressive product development and introduction cadence. From a balance sheet perspective, in the first quarter, we repurchased $42 million of common stock, bringing us to a total of $116 million. Since the start of the program, we have repurchased 8.1 million common shares and we remain committed to finishing the entire $210 million program this year. We also remain confident in our ability to achieve our three main financial targets under our M2016 program. Now, let's talk about the global markets, starting with a closer look at North America on slide 4. In December, we told you we expected Class 8 volumes to be in the range of 275,000 units to 290,000 units for fiscal 2016. Based on current market conditions and discussions with our customers, we've reduced our outlook to approximately 265,000 units. As you can see from this chart, this fiscal year production translates to a calendar year of 250,000 units. In our first fiscal quarter, production was approximately 72,000 units or 14,000 units higher than the current outlook for the fourth calendar quarter. This is an important data point to be aware of when comparing our projections for 2016, as compared to others in the industry. With the changes in order levels over the past couple of months, and concerns regarding inventory levels in the North American Class 8 trucking market, we have seen significant volatility in the equity values and companies in our sector. Our belief is that based upon the fundamental improvements we've made to the company over the past few years, we will continue to generate meaningful earnings and cash flow, even at volume levels lower than where we are today. As a result, we wanted to provide you with a data point that may help you model how volume changes in North America impact us. For every 5,000 unit change in Class 8 production, the revenue impact to us is approximately $20 million. We also expect to continue to manage our incremental and decremental earnings conversion on revenue at our normal historical levels of 15% to 20%. You can use this as a guide as you think about the impact of different Class 8 market assumptions on our earnings and cash flow. In addition to significantly increasing the profitability of Meritor through the execution of our M2016 strategy, we have also substantially reduced the breakeven points of the company. This has been accomplished through a reduction in debt and pension liabilities over the last three years. All of these changes make us confident in our ability to achieve both our short and long-term objectives, even in this current market environment. Let's go to slide 5. With the exception of North America, our outlook for the remaining global markets is unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect Western Europe to remain stable with moderate growth of 3% to 5% this year. As we've said, the average age of the truck fleet is about 7.5 years, which should help drive new truck production. Freight tonnage movement in the region also continues to gradually improve as well. India is showing signs of strengthening. Strong GDP growth is driving growth in truck production, and we expect that to continue this year. We are developing and introducing many new products specifically designed for this region so that we have a portfolio that continues to meet the unique needs of our growing customer base. South America continues in a deep recession, with no significant change expected in the near-term. We anticipate volumes to decline year-over-year by 10% to 20%, resulting in total production of 70,000 to 80,000 medium and heavy units in fiscal 2016. China also remains a difficult market, but we anticipate stabilization in bus and coach, and off-highway markets in fiscal 2016. On slide 6, we wanted to reiterate our commitment to increased results-oriented product development. The financial improvements that we've made at the company have enabled us to generate strong, sustainable levels of cash flow. This allows us to maintain our commitment to investing in a robust product portfolio that is market-directed toward specific customer applications. This is a high priority for us as we strive to meet the needs of our customers around the world and capitalize on the future recovery in the markets. In the past, we'd launched approximately three products annually. Over the past two years and going forward, we plan to launch six to seven every year. Here, you see the major product launches we have planned for 2016. This development and launch plan includes products for heavy and medium duty, as well as vocational and trailer products. Our product development focus is on advanced gear manufacturing and efficiency, which is reflected in many of these products and will continue to generate even more advancements down the road. This is the new Meritor, where you can expect this rate of development to continue. We will work with our customers to introduce products that meet their needs. As I said, we view this as a critical success factor to our future growth strategy. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the quarter and our outlook for the fiscal year. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our first quarter financial results, and then I'll take you through our updated 2016 guidance. Overall, we had another quarter of strong performance. While we face challenging global markets, we continue to execute and deliver on our M2016 strategies. The result is that we're driving margin performance, which is overcoming these macroeconomic headwinds, leading to a sustained trend of positive bottom-line earnings and strong EBITDA margins. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 7, where you'll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $809 million in the quarter, down 8% from last year. The lower revenue was primarily driven by weaker currencies in Europe and Brazil relative to the U.S. dollar, and lower commercial truck production in Brazil. That drove gross margin to $104 million or 12.9% of sales. SG&A was $9 million lower in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. This quarter, we received $17 million of settlement proceeds related to certain asbestos insurance claims that were previously in dispute. Of this $17 million, we were able to recognize $5 million as income in the current period. This insurance settlement is another step forward in our strategy to mitigate the cost of our legacy liabilities, like asbestos. Excluding these insurance proceeds, SG&A was still lower by $4 million relative to last year, as we continue to maintain discipline in managing our cost structure. Interest expense was $22 million in the quarter compared to $19 million a year ago. You may recall that in the first quarter of last year, we had a $2 million one-time favorable impact from interest income in Brazil relating to a refund of a judicial deposit. Income tax expense was $7 million in the first quarter of 2016, which translates to an effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This relatively low effective tax rate is a reflection of the fact that we are starting to generate earnings in jurisdictions like the U.S. where we continue to maintain valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Because of this, we are currently booking no tax expense against such earnings. In addition, it's important to note that $2 million of the reported $7 million in book tax expense is non-cash, and relates to the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions like Sweden, Italy, and Mexico, where we have reversed our valuation allowances. As we discussed at our Analyst Day in December, our adjusted diluted EPS now excludes such non-cash tax expense associated with the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with NOLs. This $2 million of non-cash tax expense is included as an add-back in the adjustment line that walks to our adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter. Bottom-line, then, we generated $28 million of income from continuing operations attributable to Meritor, and adjusted income from continuing operations of $31 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Let's move to slide 8, which compares our sales and EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 2015. You can really see the impact foreign currency had on our financial results year-over-year, a $51 million impact on revenue and a $12 million impact on EBITDA. But with the good news we generated in SG&A, and with continued reductions in material, labor and burden costs, we largely offset the EBITDA impact of foreign exchange. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.4%, up 40 basis points over last year. Slide 9 details first quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $633 million, down $70 million or 10% from the same period last year. The revenue decline was driven by the currency translation and lower production in Brazil that I discussed previously. Segment EBITDA was $52 million, down $4 million from last year. With EBITDA dollars down only modestly, that drove an increase in EBITDA margin for the segment to 8.2%, up 20 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by lower material, labor and burden costs, which more than offset the margin impact of lower revenue. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $203 million, down 2% from last year. This decline was driven by currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $20 million, down $5 million compared to last year. The decrease was driven by currency impacts and one-time launch costs discrete to the quarter, associated with a new warehouse management system. As we told you in the past, the first quarter is normally our weakest in this segment, as there are fewer selling days and certain seasonal trends that impact this business. As we head through the balance of the year, we do expect to see our margins in Aftermarket & Trailer segment return to the levels you've seen in recent quarters. So, we remain bullish in our ability to sustain those types of margins in the business as we look forward. Now, let's turn to slide 10. For the first quarter, total free cash flow was negative $27 million compared to negative $21 million in the prior year. As you know, our first quarter is typically the weakest from a free cash flow perspective due to fewer selling days as a result of the holiday season, which drives lower revenue; working capital trends as we build inventories in anticipation of the aftermarket spring selling season; and the payment of annual incentive compensation for our employees. With those things considered, this first quarter played out pretty much in line with our expectations, with two exceptions. First, our inventory levels are slightly elevated this quarter as we work to manage the supply chain with North American volumes coming in lower than we were anticipating. We do expect to drive these inventory levels down over the balance of the year as we adjust our purchasing activity and inventory banks to reflect the more normalized Class 8 truck volumes that we are now expecting. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we also received $17 million in asbestos insurance proceeds in the quarter. While $5 million was recognized as income, the remaining $12 million is a positive cash flow item that didn't flow through the P&L. You can see that highlighted separately on the cash flow statement. With this first quarter in hand, we remain confident that we are on track to generate more than $100 million in free cash flow for the full year. In fact, that means we anticipate we'll generate more than $130 million in free cash flow over the last nine months of the fiscal year, which is implied in our full year free cash flow guidance. Now, let's turn to slide 11, which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased $42 million of common equity totaling 3.9 million common shares. With more than $130 million of free cash flow generation to come over the balance of 2016, we remain on track to complete the remainder of the buyback program $94 million before the end of the fiscal year. You should expect us to be opportunistic in executing the remaining buybacks under this program, particularly in light of where current market prices are for our equity and equity-linked securities. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 12. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted earlier, we have lowered our fiscal year 2016 sales guidance to the bottom end of the range that we previously provided. We're now expecting approximately $3.4 billion of revenue. The driver of this downward revision is our expectation of lower production levels in the North America Class 8 market. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we remain on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 10%. We will continue to drive margin performance in the face of challenging end markets, just like we've consistently done over the last three years. And we'll do this through continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives, particularly material, labor and burden performance. That said, 10% margin on $50 million of lower revenue relative to the midpoint of our prior guidance suggests that earnings will be lower by about $5 million. That's why we are reducing our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share for fiscal 2016, down $0.05 from our previous guidance. Similarly, we expect free cash flow to be down slightly as well, but still at a strong level of $110 million for the full fiscal year. Through M2016, we fundamentally changed our earnings profile and cash-generating ability such that, even in this revenue environment, we are still on pace to achieve more than $150 million in adjusted net income from continuing operations and more than $100 million in free cash flow. We successfully managed the North American truck upturn profitably and with strong cash flow generation, and we are doing the same as our largest market returns to more normalized levels. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide some closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 13. First and foremost, I'll reiterate that we are on track to meet all three financial targets we established for M2016. As we've continued to demonstrate strong results driven by the improvements we've made across the company, we've remained confident in our ability to achieve our margin, net debt, and new business win metrics this year, and to successfully launch our M2019 growth focus plan. With the capabilities we have demonstrated since launching M2016, we have strong momentum in the commercial vehicle marketplace. We've executed on a clear set of strategic priorities that were designed and developed to increase shareholder value. We've proven our ability to execute despite the unfavorable market dynamics that have been ongoing since we launched the M2016 program. Instead of using the markets as an excuse for not achieving our objectives, we use them as a challenge to demonstrate our operating excellence, and we will continue to do so. We have growing customer relationships and a strong brand, both of which are helping us win meaningful business within important global manufacturers. We continue to add to our robust product line that is further strengthening our global market leadership positions, and we have the leadership talent to take us where we want to go. Now, let's take your questions. Operator : And your first question on the line comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Please proceed, sir. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Just want to kind of drill in on a couple of items. You've been assuming $175 million of new business wins in fiscal 2016 coming out of the Analyst Day. Is that still intact? Does the incremental weakness in Class 8 affect that? What could move this number up or down? And I guess \u2013 I don't know if you count as new business or just ongoing business \u2013 where did market share in Class 8 kind of shake out in the quarter, and what do you expect for the rest of the year? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Brian. This is Jay. Thanks for the question. Yes, in (22:25) comments I made today about the $435 million of being on track new businesses, our confidence in achieving that $175 million, we do market-adjust that number for all the wins globally. So, in North America, as I mentioned, we are seeing the aggressive ramp-up of PACCAR. But please remember, we also had a pretty significant win with Scania in Europe on the braking side. We've had a good hub reduction win with Daimler in India and several other wins throughout the world, in addition to seeing our emerging market axle in China starting to get a great reception with the bus and coach manufacturers. So, there's gives and takes on the market's impact on that, but overall, we remain very confident in the number. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Second question is just around share repurchase. I mean, you must have thought the stock was cheap at $11 when you bought it back. It's now lower. But just given concerns over the cycle, how are you thinking about your kind of balance sheet downside liquidity versus share repurchases in light of \u2013 and just all how that whole \u2013 remind us how that whole European customer receivables factoring kind of fits in your thinking on that. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Brian. This is Kevin. I'll take that. Yeah, I mean, from a downside liquidity planning, we update that model pretty regularly, as we talked about at Analyst Day, in terms of how we establish how much liquidity we need to manage through the cycles, especially a down cycle that could last upward of three years. And we normally think we drive toward having liquidity in the zip code of about 20% of annualized revenue. As we look at where we sit today, and with our expectation that we are on pace to generate $130 million of free cash flow over the last nine months of the year, we feel confident about our ability to execute the balance of the program which is $94 million between now and the end of the fiscal year. We will look at the market, we'll look at the opportunities that are out there across both equity and equity-linked securities and \u2013 but we are confident we can \u2013 we have the liquidity to manage to be able to support that program. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And in terms of factoring, any change there? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, no change in factoring. We will continue to utilize those programs as operating \u2013 as part of our operating cash flow in that business. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And is that due \u2013 at least historically, I remember, is due to some \u2013 one very large customer being a rather late-by-world-standards payer? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, I think this is traditionally part of our working capital arrangement with our European customer base and so... Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : ... it's just part of the agreements that we have in place with those customers. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And final question, did you contemplate the insurance recovery when you did your free cash flow guide? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The original free cash flow guide? Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes.... Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : There were elements of certain things we were assuming in recoveries in terms of insurance, but I won't get into the specifics how much it was in terms of our expectations. But in terms of the first quarter, I don't think we were anticipating that we were going to see that flow through our results this quarter. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Please proceed. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : So just a quick follow-up on the share repo. Kevin, I think in prior quarters, you provided what you guys have repurchased since quarter end. Did you guys repurchase anything since quarter end? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Since quarter end, we have been in blackout. So we haven't been in the market in terms of open market repurchases. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Got it. And then just a question on the revenue guidance. So, in order to achieve the revenue guidance of $3.4 billion for the full year certainly implies a meaningful step-up in revenue from first quarter levels. Clearly, there is less working days or there were less working days and some OEM production shutdowns during the December quarter. We understand Aftermarket & Trailer, it's typically the low watermark for the year in Q1. But just in light of North American production coming down, I mean, is there anything else that we should be thinking of to boost revenue such as revenue from new business wins materializing more throughout the remainder of the year to get us comfortable with the $3.4 billion in revenue? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Neil. This is Jay. I think you've listed off a few of them, actually. Our business, if you recall, at normalized stable market levels is highly seasonal with the first quarter and fourth quarter being our lowest revenue quarters, and the second quarter and third quarter being the strongest. There are several reasons for that. As you mentioned, the holiday shutdowns in North America and Europe in the first quarter and fourth quarter around production, and also the aftermarket business and brake replacement season is highly seasonal. And as you mentioned, we are seeing the ramp-up of our new business wins, as I mentioned on the call. My comments were above 50% penetration with PACCAR. We expect that to continue to increase throughout the year. And if you look at our estimate of the North American Class 8 market, you certainly can see we're not counting on that to be stronger in the back half of the year, certainly, than what we saw in Q1. So, I think those are the main reasons. And we do feel confident in that guidance. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks, Jay. And then, just one final one. Kevin, you alluded to the fact that you expect Aftermarket & Trailer segment margins to pick up for the remainder of the year. I mean, I think last quarter, you talked to 14% to 15% for the full year. Just to clarify, is that outlook still intact? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think it's fair to say. As we look at the last nine months of the year, we would expect to see the margins in that segment return to more normalized levels, or what we've been experiencing in the back half of last year. And it's really driven by a couple things. One is revenue picking up, because Q1 is always the low watermark for that business; and second, it's the continued execution of material labor and burden performance initiatives as those continue to come on over the course of the year. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the aftermarket margin question. In the commentary, it notes that there is a new warehouse cost. The decrementals seem extremely high on the sales decline. Can you maybe quantify the warehouse costs, so we can kind of get a better sense of the underlying decremental ones? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I mean \u2013 and I'd say a couple things. I mean, the headwinds we saw in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, obviously, we had a little bit of a revenue impact, but there's overall FX impacts that we saw, translation and transaction related. As it relates to the warehouse issue, if you look at our North American aftermarket business, the labor and burden year-over-year was about $2 million worth, primarily driven by the discrete issue in the quarter related to the implementation of the new warehouse system. We had an old legacy system, no longer supported, and the new system that we put in place helps us improve throughput and fill rate. So, we're happy with the new system. We had some inefficiencies as we went through the execution of launching that back in November, but that was discrete to the first quarter. So, we should be back on track as we go into the back half of the year. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : How should we think about the sales trajectory for aftermarket with some of the weakness in the new vehicle market? I mean, does that actually help the demand in that business as we go through the year? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, traditionally, aftermarket has been somewhat countercyclical. And so, again, as I stated earlier, it is also highly seasonal with a fairly dependable brake replacement season here in Q2, Q3. So, I think we should expect to see some pretty healthy revenue growth sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And in terms of the insurance recovery within the quarter, you said you recognized $5 million of the $12 million, I believe or $17 million, sorry. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's right. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : How do we think about it? Are you going to recognize more of it in this year? Or is that just a one quarter benefit? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It depends. I mean, as we receive the $17 million of proceeds, we determine how much is earned and it's linked to our estimate of what the probable liability is on our asbestos exposures in the Maremont entity going forward. So, if our outlook for those liabilities were to increase over time, the potential exists that we would recognize more of that \u2013 the remaining $12 million into income. If those liabilities decreased over time from our current expectations, the potential exists that we would return some of those monies back to the insurance company, which is why it's sitting on the balance sheet at the moment as opposed to being booked as income. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Why the logic of keeping it as a \u2013 not treating it as a special item? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, I mean, because it's really offsetting our ongoing asbestos costs each quarter. I mean, every quarter we have millions of dollars' worth of costs that are embedded within our cost structure, and this is simply a recovery related to those costs that we have. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I have a question for you on the revenue revisions. There is \u2013 on slide 4, there is a sensitivity that you provided for us to understand how the changes in the North American Class 8 production outlook would impact your revenue and your EBITDA margin. Looking at that at midpoint, provisions from prior outlook appear to be somewhere around a $70 million impact to the prior midpoint of revenue assumptions, but your revisions were about $50 million from prior midpoint. So, wondering what's driving the offset to that North American production decline outlook? And then your EBITDA margin was maintained at 10%. Are you finding incremental opportunities to \u2013 for cost savings, or is that something else? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Irina, It's Kevin. I'll take that. You have to keep in mind, when we're talking about the guidance that we provided before, we're talking in ranges and approximations. And our prior revenue guidance was a $100 million range between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion. So, we were operating somewhere along that range. And as we looked at the changes that we expected to occur based on the North American truck market coming down, we felt that with that, plus any other of the small puts and takes we see, the appropriate guidance would be around $3.4 billion; again, an approximation. We could be a little bit above that level. We could be a little bit below that level. But we think the balanced look at this at this point is $3.4 billion. As you think about the margin, keep in mind this is at the bottom end of the prior guidance. In the prior guidance, we thought we would still be on track to achieve 10% with some of the programs we had out there, even if we trended down to $3.4 billion. And we continue to believe that's the case based on what we're looking at. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And just as a follow-up to that, what are \u2013 what FX assumptions is your guidance currently reflecting? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's pretty much comparable to what we provided last time. I mean, it's about $1.10 to the euro, and I think about BRL3.90 or so to U.S. dollar. Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : And the final question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Yeah. Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Yeah, just a couple. I wanted to follow up \u2013 I think it was Colin Langan that was asking about the $5 million. So it is included in the EBITDA \u2013 adjusted EBITDA that you report, but it's fairly substantial, right? It feels like it would be like worth kind of 50 basis points, 60 basis points. So, is that \u2013 I mean, in that quarter, was there a kind of big disbursement that sort of offset it and the net was a wash, or is there some lumpiness to this thing? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, I mean, you're right. The $5 million was discrete to the quarter, a one-time item. But we have lots of pluses and minuses that hit our results, just like we had the Aftermarket & Trailer discrete item in the quarter going a little bit the other way. I think, as you've seen over time, we've been trying not to adjust out any items plus or minus as a company, and really manage through those and drive to bottom-line performance in terms of margin and bottom-line earnings. And that's what we're doing right now. So we manage all those puts and takes, and we drove to this level of margin. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I'm sorry to get into this, I know you said it, but the warehouse piece was just how much on a net basis? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, again, we had negative year-over-year labor and burden in that \u2013 in the aftermarket North American business of $2 million, and it was primarily related to this particular issue. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, okay. And just \u2013 I mean, look, you've gone over a number of these factors but \u2013 right, if I think of the net of those two things, I mean, you were up 40 basis points \u2013 including them, excluding them, you were probably up a little bit less to get to up 50 basis points, which is implied in your guidance. It would require a back-half step-up in performance. If I just kind of try and summarize the things you've talked about, I mean you did talk about a seasonality issue, although, that year-on-year shouldn't matter too much. But you have \u2013 I guess the aftermarket growth that you referred to, you have the net new business launches. Is there any sort of other items that I'm not including here as we think of the drivers of that improvement? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's continued in performance and executing on continued performance initiatives throughout the year. I mean, remember, our Q1 is normally our softest quarter and look back to last year even, we were 9.0% Q1, but we ended the full year at 9.5%. That's a type of performance we're expecting this year. Again, coming out of the gate, with a weaker first quarter, because it's our low revenue watermark, 9.4%, but expecting the same type of performance in the back half to drive the same type of improvement year in the full year that we saw relative to Q1 last year. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. No, I get that. I was just trying to keep it in terms of basis points of margin improvement, right, which seems to be back-end loaded as well? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's correct. And a big piece driven by revenue and continued execution of the performance initiatives. That's really the story of what drives the back half for the last nine months. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, okay. The other question I had just is on the \u2013 and thank you for the detail on the production assumptions for Class 8. I mean, I just \u2013 this is more just an industry question. It feels like \u2013 I think that's down 15% your calendar year, let's call it, calendar year Q1. You know that is less than \u2013 done less than orders and so I just wanted to see \u2013 I mean that, to us, would be kind of a positive number, just better than what we had modeled, quite frankly. So, is \u2013 how much of that is based on kind of a real tangible order book that's flowing through right now? And how much of that could be variable, if you will? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Patrick, I think, obviously, we've completed one fiscal quarter. So, we have three to go, and we're sitting almost the full month into the second quarter and our production outlook is pretty accurate for the remainder of this quarter. So you can think for six months of the year we have a pretty high degree of certainty and then we are continuing to evaluate the orders, but the backlog to build ratio remains fairly strong. We just had our Fleet Advisory Council and national meeting at most of major fleets. A week or so ago, those fleets are continuing to say business is strong and so the fundamentals still look very stable. So, although it is a pretty big step-down from last year, we think it's a fairly reasonable assumption based on what we're seeing. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Appreciate the color, guys. Thanks a lot. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for everyone joining the call today. And if you have any further questions, just give Carl a call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions. I'd like to redirect the call back to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Carl D. Anderson - Vice President and Treasurer : Thank you, Tanisha (39:22). As Jay alluded to, if there is any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by saying that I continue to be proud of our team's performance this quarter and over the past three years since we launched M2016. We use the word transformational to describe the change that has occurred at Meritor. We've created a new way of working that is now characterized by a dedicated focus on our most critical priorities and disciplined execution toward achievements of our long-term objectives. Simply put, M2016 defined for us the areas we knew we needed to dramatically approve upon if we were to become a company positioned for growth and greater shareholder return. Those areas included safety, quality, and delivery, product development, improved customer relationships and better cost management. Driven by the discipline we've demonstrated during the execution of M2016, we've proven our ability to successfully manage the cyclicality inherent in our industry without impeding the investments required to fund our future growth objectives. Through excellent management of materials, labor and burden, in addition to growing our business with important customers and developing new products, we are on track to meet the financial objectives we set three years ago. And we accomplished this even as some of our largest markets have declined more significantly than anticipated. Before I go on, I want to take a moment to touch on our recent announcement. As most of you know, Ike Evans has stepped down from his position as Executive Chairman, but will continue to serve as a Director on our board. Bill Newlin has been elected to serve as non-Executive Chairman. Ike's decision to step down reflects the planned leadership transition that commenced last year with the separation of the Chairman and CEO roles. Ike played an integral role in our transformation and steered us through the launch and execution of our M2016 plan, which has greatly improved Meritor's operations and financial position. We are grateful that we will continue to work with Ike as a member of our board and benefit from his insight and experience. Now, let's turn to slide three and talk about the highlights from our second fiscal quarter of 2016. In the phase of rapidly changing end markets, we're continuing to execute well both in markets where we are experiencing increasing and decreasing production volumes. The softening market in North America, combined with the severe recession that continues in South America, is obviously putting pressure on our results this year, and is only being partially offset by strengthening markets in Europe and India. The new business wins and penetration increases that we've driven in M2016, particularly in North America, have further mitigated the effects of some of our weaker markets. Even in this environment, we reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.9%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41 and revenue that is down 5% or $43 million from the same period last year. As I said earlier, strong value-added customer relationships continue to differentiate us in the market. In March, we were pleased to announce a contract extension with Navistar that I'll talk about on the next slide. In the second quarter, we also repurchased $55 million of our 4.625% convertible notes that were outstanding. Since the start of our $210 million equity and equity-linked repurchase program, we bought back 8.1 million common shares and are on track to complete the entire program by September this year, another commitment achieved in the phase of volatile markets. Let's move to slide four for a closer look at the Navistar agreement. As we announced, under the terms of this contract, we retained standard position for brakes and rear axles, as well as standard position for front axles in severe service, medium-duty and bus applications. Not only are we excited about the opportunity to extend our relationship and retain standard position for another five years, we also look forward to collaborating with Navistar on its Open Integration initiative. Open Integration will utilize future technologies and designs to provide improvements in the total cost of ownership for end users while also offering supplier expertise and the availability of a broader service network like we have at Meritor. If you turn to slide five, you'll see that we are also offering our customers integrated products and bundlings that will provide many benefits including lower costs, weight savings, ease of assembly and serviceability. Let me give you a few examples. In March, we introduced the MFS+ Front Steer Axle for 12,000 pound and 13,000 pound applications in North America. This is the next evolution in Meritor's front steer axle offering, with new advanced beam material and integrated torque plates and tie-rod arms that offers up to 85 pounds of weight savings and allows for easier installation. We'll take this as a step further over the next few years when we launch a fully integrated front axle system that optimizes form, fit and function. This system will include Meritor EX+ disc brakes and additional wheel-end options. In China, we're launching Meritor's DUALite Series of integrated systems for the bus and coach market. With more than 50% of our business in the region now being on highway, we're offering fully dressed axle options that are manufactured locally. Customers will benefit from lower life cycle costs and increased reliability. And for the Humvee recap program that could start in 2019, we will offer an integrated rolling chassis. It will be complete with front and rear high-mobility independent suspensions and fully dressed with wheel-ends and disc brakes, a transfer case and frame rails reinforced to handle the higher load requirements for the upgrade. We're going to do all the assembly in our plants and deliver the integrated chassis to our customers just like you see here. Again, the primary benefit is that like the others, it has been engineered as a system. Specific benefits include better ride and handling, improved driveline angles, reduced weight, and easier packaging into a Humvee capsule. We are also currently pursuing opportunities for this solution outside the U.S. market. We'll share more about this new integrated solutions in the future. Now, let's go to slide six, for a look at our end markets. Overall, we've reduced our outlook for North and South America. We're lowering our expectations for Class 8 volumes in North America by 8% to approximately 245,000 units, down from the 265,000 units we projected in February. We believe that excess Class 8 inventory and declining used truck prices are causing the fleets to adjust their orders for new trucks. This is leading OEs to reduce production levels. One data point we watch is the inventory to retail sales ratio, which is currently at 3.3 months, significantly higher than more healthy level of 1.5 months to 2.5 months. Based on various data points including truck ton miles, we believe we may be in the midst of an inventory correction in Class 8. And once excess inventory is used, we expect to see the market stabilize at a relatively normal production level. Also, we have been seeing lower than anticipated order activity in our North American aftermarket business. As we started the year, we expected the overall market in North America to be up modestly in 2016. However, during the first six months of the fiscal year, we have actually seen the market soften. We have been able to mitigate the effect on revenue through increased share in certain product lines like air systems (10:53), which is why our overall revenue for that business is roughly flat year-over-year. But the market softening that we're seeing this year is a headwind relative to our prior expectations. The medium-duty market continues to be robust, and as a result, we have increased our forecast for Class 5-7 to the top end of the range we gave you on our first quarter call at 220,000 units. This also makes us more excited about the introduction of the 13X axle that we've previously discussed which is specifically targeted at this market. Moving over to Europe, the market remains stable and is trending positive as we look at medium and heavy truck registrations and the road freight index, two market indicators in the region. We expect the European market to be up 4% to 6% year-over-year, consistent with our previous forecast. In South America, I'm sure you know the political and economic situation remains extremely challenged. GDP continues to decline. The political environment is uncertain, and we do not have any indication at this time that a recovery is likely in the near future. We are revising our outlook for the year to the low-end of our previous range at 70,000 units. On slide seven, we have provided an update of our M2016 scorecard. The main takeaway from this chart is that we are on track to achieve all three financial objectives this year. As we told you, we felt margin improvement was the most important target. When we launched this program three years ago, we had just posted an adjusted EBITDA margin of slightly under 6% for the first half of 2013. Our target was to increase our margin by around 400 basis points. And as you can see, we've been extremely successful in moving along that trajectory. We ended last year at 9.5%. This quarter, we're at 9.9% and we remain confident we're going to hit the 10% for the full fiscal year. The second financial target was to reduce net debt by more than $400 million. We achieved that target at the end of fiscal 2015, and we're confident we'll stay at or below that level through fiscal 2016. At the same time, we are returning value to our shareholders and are on track to complete the $210 million stock repurchase program. Our third target was to achieve $500 million of incremental book revenue. As of March 31 of this year, we are at $450 million. Building relationships with our customers and introducing new products to the market have provided us the opportunity to grow our share, particularly in our largest market, North America. We now have long-term contracts with the four largest OEs in North America and our partnerships with each of them have never been stronger. With the foundation established by our M2016 plan, we are now well-positioned to grow in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for more detail on the quarter and our outlook for the 2016 fiscal year. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. As you heard from Jay, we had another quarter of strong performance as we continue to execute our M2016 strategy. The consistency in our results over many quarters has established a solid foundation to build upon, as we begin our M2019 growth strategy. Let's walk through the details of our second quarter financial results by turning to slide eight. Sales were $821 million in the quarter, down 5% compared to last year. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower commercial truck production in North and South America and weaker foreign currencies, especially in Brazil, relative to the U.S. dollar. Although revenue was down, we expanded our gross margin by 140 basis points, reflecting our continuing ability to drive lower material, labor and burden costs. In fact, our 14.7% gross margin is one of the highest we've achieved since the launch of M2016. SG&A was $3 million higher in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to a favorable adjustment to our incentive compensation accruals last year. Income tax expense was $7 million in the second quarter of 2016, which translates to an effective tax rate of approximately 18%, up slightly from last year. The increased tax rate was driven by the fact that we now recognized tax expense in countries like Italy and Sweden, following the reversal of our valuation allowances in those countries at the end of last year. As we discussed last fall, we are now adding back non-cash tax expense in countries with net operating losses when reporting adjusted income and adjusted EPS. This accounted for $3 million in the quarter of the total adjustments you see on the slide. The bottom line is that we generated $33 million of income from continuing operations attributable to Meritor and after adjustments for non-cash tax expense from restructuring costs, we generated adjusted income from continuing operations of $38 million or $0.41 per share, down just $0.01 from last year. Let's move to slide nine, which compares our sales and EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 to 2015. Foreign exchange continued to be a headwind in the quarter on both revenue and EBITDA. Revenue was down $24 million due to foreign exchange translation driven by the strong U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and other currencies. As highlighted on the chart, we also had $6 million of lower EBITDA year-over-year caused by the one-time gain from foreign exchange hedges that we reported in 2015. Beyond foreign exchange, we saw revenue reduction relative to last year of $19 million due to lower production in the North America Class 8 truck market and in South America partially offset by increasing penetration in North America from our new business wins announced over the last couple of years. Despite this overall lower production, we continue to drive strong material, labor and burden performance. This, combined with lower steel indices, overcame lower production and drove $5 million in positive EBITDA from volume mix, performance and other. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.9%, down only 20 basis points from last year. And if you were to exclude the one-time FX gains from a year ago, then we really saw better cost management completely offset the impact of lower revenue on our reported EBITDA. Slide 10 details second quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck and Industrial segment, sales were $631 million, down $50 million or 7% from the same period last year. Lower Class 8 truck production in North America, combined with lower production and a weaker currency in South America, drove the revenue decline in the segment. Again though, this was partially mitigated by our increased market share on axles in the Class 8 truck market. Segment EBITDA was $56 million, down only $1 million from last year, which drove an increase in EBITDA margin to 8.9%, up 50 basis points from last year. This increased margin was primarily driven by strong cost management that continues to favorably impact our earnings. In the Aftermarket and Trailer segment, sales were $218 million, up 3% from last year, driven by stronger sales in our North American trailer business. Segment EBITDA was $28 million, down $2 million compared to last year. The decrease was driven primarily by unfavorable mix in our aftermarket business, which brought our margin down 140 basis points to 12.8%. Now, let's turn to slide 11. For the second quarter, total free cash flow was $19 million compared to $27 million in the prior year. The biggest driver of the decline year-over-year was the increase in capital expenditures, as we remain committed to investing in new product development to support our M2016 and M2019 revenue growth initiatives. You can see this by looking at the bottom of the slide where our cash flow from operations, which excludes CapEx, was actually up by $6 million from the second quarter of last year. Now, let's turn to slide 12 which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. As expected, investors exercised their put option on $55 million of 4.625% convertible notes. As a result, we repurchased these notes at par during the quarter. Consistent with what we previously communicated, this equity-linked repurchase is part of our $210 million buyback program, which means that our cumulative repurchases now stand at $171 million. With approximately $100 million of free cash flow generation expected during the second half of this fiscal year, we remain confident that we will complete the buyback program by September as planned. Given where market prices are for our common equity, our current expectation is that substantially all of the remaining $39 million will be used to repurchase common equity. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 13. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted earlier, we've lowered our 2016 sales guidance to approximately $3.275 billion. Our current expectations of lower production levels in the North America Class 8 market and flat aftermarket sales are the primary drivers of this downward revision. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we remain on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 10%. We continue to drive margin performance just like we have consistently done throughout M2016. Although we're maintaining our 10% margin outlook with revenue lower by $125 million, we now expect to generate lower bottom line earnings. That's why we're reducing our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $1.55 to $1.65 for fiscal year 2016, down $0.10 from our previous outlook. We continue to expect another strong year for free cash flow generation, although slightly lower than previous guidance as a result of the lower bottom line earnings. In addition, as we head into the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate that we will not be able to reduce inventory to previously targeted levels, because production had declined more rapidly than we anticipated when the year began. As a result, we're expecting modestly elevated inventory levels until the early part of next fiscal year. Nonetheless, we still expect to generate $90 million of free cash flow for the full fiscal year. Our execution of M2016 has fundamentally strengthened our earnings profile and cash-generating ability, and that has put us firmly on the path of achieving our third consecutive year reporting more than $100 million of adjusted net income. We successfully managed the North American truck upturn profitably and with strong cash flow generation, and we're doing the same as our largest market now returns to more normalized production levels. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 14. The message I want to leave you with today is that our continued focus on those parts of the business that we can control has allowed us to stay on track to achieve our M2016 financial objectives. Over the past three years, we have developed the core competencies needed to help mitigate the effects of the cyclicality inherent in our business. In other words, downturns are not as dramatic (23:29) to our bottom line as they once were. Cost management, customer relationships and new product development have led to an improved financial profile. This is demonstrated by the fact that despite taking our sales outlook down by $125 million for fiscal 2016, we are still tracking to the 10% adjusted EBITDA margin, and we continue to win in the marketplace. With these competencies in place, we are well-positioned to execute on our M2019 growth focus plan which could be further fueled if our global markets strengthen over the next few years. Now, let's take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is now open. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Any color on what drove the negative aftermarket trailer mix? Is that just reflecting the trailer growing and aftermarket start being flat (24:45) or can you give any color on how aftermarket within that is performing? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Colin, this is Kevin. I'll take that. Fundamentally, it's a change in the mix of our aftermarket North America portfolio that we've seen year-over-year where we really saw the increase in brake and wheel-end components which tends to be lower margin business for us, offset by a decrease in product mix of our higher margin business which tends to be our drivetrain components. So fundamentally, we saw that mix shift on a year-over-year basis. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So it's within aftermarket. And how is the aftermarket trending? Your guidance for the year now is flat. How has it been? Within the results, is the aftermarket flat for the year-to-date or is that just a continuation (25:26) or does that imply getting better or worse for the rest of the year within Aftermarket and Trailer? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sorry. We were having a tough time hearing you, but I think, Colin, your question was is aftermarket down for the full year. Did I hear you correctly? Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Just what is the outlook for aftermarket, just broadly? I mean, because within \u2013 I'm trying to understand embedded in the Aftermarket and Trailer, how is the aftermarket actually doing standalone? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So far this year, aftermarket is slightly down in North America. But overall, we were expecting actually the markets to be up in aftermarket. But we haven't seen that as we were anticipating. On a full year basis, we're expecting the aftermarket to be relatively flat year-over-year, but what that means is that we're going to see our typical seasonal increase in revenue in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, particularly as we go into this third fiscal quarter. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And can you give a \u2013 just remind us where you stand with market share in terms of the PACCAR win last year? Are you \u2013 when do you \u2013 have you been increasing shares sequentially? And when do you start to anniversary the gains that you got with that customer? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we jumped off as (26:39) we talked about head count on \u2013 this is Jay. We jumped off as (26:42) we talked about at the Analyst Day about 50% penetration. And so, I think that we're starting to \u2013 we certainly expect year-over-year increases, because that penetration level certainly wasn't at that same level at these quarters last year. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. A couple of things. First, can you just help us think about when we think about the mix and performance? On our calculations, it's probably worth at least $9 million or $10 million in the quarter, within that volume, which is obviously a headwind I'm talking about Commercial. How do you \u2013 could you divide that between you're doing better gross margins and the products either through and then to the extent you're doing that is to what extent it's kind of moving to more differentiated products with our margins or is it materials? And then in terms of the major kind of cost takeouts or cost improvement outside of SG&A, the cost permits are going to COGS, how that played out? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Brian, this is Kevin. You're right. Your math is roughly in the right range as you think about that $5 million line item we call volume mix performance and other, and there is volume and mix is a negative in that number. So you're in the right area. In terms of what that $10 million or something in that range looks like, what's driving the positive numbers there, a piece of it is lower steel indices. That's worth about $4 million year-over-year. The difference between the good news we get from lower steel prices from our suppliers and passing that back through to our customers on a lagged basis. And the balance of that is really material, labor and burden performance, driving cost performance not really, in this case, to the SG&A line, it's really been through the material, labor and performance lines, which goes through the gross margin. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And second question. What's your expectations for the revenue tailwind from new business? You started out assuming $175 million, but obviously, the end market in North American Class 8 has moved downward. And so, where are you on that, or was it maybe not tied to the Class 8 market? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It was tied to the Class 8 market. When we originally announced that, it was based effectively on about a $260 million market when we're announcing new business wins. So effectively, in our guidance, we are seeing the effects of what we had hoped to achieve in terms of the new business year-over-year. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, good. And just final question, given the softness of the Class 8 market, how is that playing through in terms of the couple of factors? First, OEMs' desire to use the in-sourced solutions when available, and second, just in terms of the pricing environment in the marketplace. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Hey, Brian. This is Jay. Yeah, I think in answer to your first question, obviously, the one customer that has that alternative would be Daimler and we're seeing our penetrations remain stable there, consistent with the agreement that we have with them over the long-term. And then, secondly, on pricing, as you're well aware, we have long-term contracts with all our customers where the pricing remains relatively fixed other than the pass-through mechanisms for materials, which we do see. As market slowdowns occur, obviously that commodity price can decline and we can be passing a lot of those benefits to customers. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But no major attempt either from the OEMs or the fleets to push the pressures on their businesses upstream to you? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think everybody in the industry appreciates that this is a highly cyclical industry, and they expect us to perform on the up-cycles when they can generate significant revenue and profitability, but that also requires that we have some fixed level of expectations of what pricing will be on the down-cycles, so we can manage our business to it. So we are not seeing them. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, my main question is just on the margin trajectory. You're sticking with the 10%. You're running kind of in the 9.6%, 9.7% range in the first half, and it does imply \u2013 it's a little bit of an acceleration in the second half, I think, like year-on-year, like, up 80 basis points. I think we've talked about some of the factors that would help like the non-recurrence of that $6 million comp issue. But what are some of the other factors that we need to think about to get to that acceleration? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Patrick, it's Kevin. I think your math is roughly right. I mean we're expecting to effectively average something around 10.4% for the back half of the year. Now, keep in mind, we're coming off a 9.9% quarter. But nonetheless, we're expecting the full back half of the year to be around 10.4%. To put that in perspective, what that means is we have to outperform 10% in the back half by about $6 million of EBITDA if you just do the math, so $3 million or so a quarter. And there's really two fundamental drivers of that. One is that revenue in the back half of the year is slightly stronger than the front half of the year. And so, we'd expect to contribute on that. And then second, we continue to reap the benefits from our performance initiatives, the material, labor and burden performance initiatives as they achieve full run rate for the full year. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. I mean for me, it's a little easier to think of it year-on-year rather than sequentially, but it sounds like aside from the comp issue, the burden initiatives will continue to produce pretty significant improvements year-on-year as well. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Absolutely. As they have even in the second quarter, and you can see that just in response to Brian's question, volume mix performance and other were showing a plus $5 million, but that has a negative headwind from the mix we talked about in the aftermarket. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Plus just volume being down $19 million, yet, we're still throwing off a plus $5 million in that line item. So our performance has been pretty significant year-over-year. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Yeah. I mean it sounded like you're pointing to something. And maybe my math is wrong, but it sounded like $8 million or $9 million of year-on-year just, I guess, performance is what I would've gotten based on that conversation. Is that right? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I mean there's a number of things going on in there. You have again the steel indices, which is a tailwind, about $4 million year-over-year. We have quite a bit of material, labor and burden performance. And there's even some negative from FX on transaction. We have some transaction purchases which is part of our material cost overall that's been negatively impacted. But the net of all of that plus the volume and mix is the plus $5 million. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I know. Maybe I'll follow up with you online, because when I was just kind of disaggregating that plus $5 million, it sounded like performance was a pretty big number like plus $8 million or $9 million within that equation, but maybe we can follow up after. Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. It's probably even a little bit north of that but that's right. It's a pretty big number. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple. Your line is now open. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Kevin, you mentioned lower steel cost, I think, was the $4 million tailwind in the quarter. Should we expect these benefits to begin to moderate or even become a headwind later this year? Can you just remind us what a typical lag is, the changes in steel indices? Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think the answer is yes to that. I mean we got some benefit in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis and some more benefit in the second quarter. But as we look at the full year, we're not expecting to see much incremental benefit from it, because in some cases, steel prices have flatted or even in North America here in the last quarter, they've ticked up a little bit. So as we look at the full year on a year-over-year basis, we think we'll see a tailwind in total, but most of that tailwind is already in the P&L that we reported for the first half. The risk we have as we look out is if steel prices were to increase, because the cost coming through from our suppliers happens more quickly than the pass-through back to our customers. And so, our outlook right now is based on an expectation that steel prices roughly moderate at where they are, which is slightly up this past quarter in North America, although slightly down still in Europe overall. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Got it. Thanks. And maybe a question for Jay. I mean just not looking for 2017 guidance by any means, but just given North America truck continues to deteriorate, again, with orders being weaker than expected out last night, just curious if you think this is more just temporary like mid-cycle slowdown, as the industry tries to work through this excess inventory, and you think we can kind of return to growth in 2017 for the North American Class 8 market. I mean just any more color you can provide on just conversations you're having with fleets and your customers. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : I think at this point we do still believe it is an inventory correction from the aggressive buy last year. I mean if you look at a lot of the underlying factors that stabilized and are starting to improve, I think the manufacturing index has been positive the last two months. We're seeing the outlook for ton miles to be slowly increasing over time. What we look at is over the long term, trucking moves almost exactly on a flat line (36:44) with GDP growth. So if the overall economy holds up, this inventory should clear the system and we should go back to more normalized levels. Now, will we get back to the peak demand we saw a year ago? Probably not. But can we get back to normal replacement demand orders and production? We believe so. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Got it. So I mean assuming that inventory correction works its way through and we get positive GDP growth, you're saying there's no reason why we shouldn't see some North American Class 8 growth next year? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's what we believe at this point, that's correct. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks, Jay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Can you just update us on any progress made during the quarter relative to your pursuit of the revenue opportunity you talked about at your last Investor Day, the components area or North America off-highway don't expect that they (37:43) contributed during the quarter, but discussions you're having with customers, et cetera. Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Great question. On the components piece, we are working with several potential customers responding to quotes that we had developed the business stream for. And so, we're very optimistic on that. As far as the off-highway, it's a little different approach. We are developing the products necessary to address that market. We're having discussions with potential customers and getting a very clear understanding of what they would expect from us in terms of product attributes and offerings, and we're aggressively investing in those applications. And so, we're still very optimistic about that. We think we have a lot of competitive strengths to bring to both of those marketplaces, not the least of which is just a reliability of delivery, the cost of our products and also the quality that we have. So we still feel very, very optimistic about those markets. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Then \u2013 and just last question, it seems like Western Europe registrations have been coming in better. I'm curious if you're also seeing it with regard to your big customer over there, Volvo and is this offset already sort of included in your lower guide today? Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll start with the end of (39:11) your question first. It is included in our guide, but I think it's more than Volvo. We are seeing that with Volvo, but I think what is really heartening to us is that our customer (39:25) and Renault were starting to see strengthening in that Southern European market as well which we haven't seen for several years. So I think it's across our customer portfolio base there in Europe. We're seeing a pretty broad-based recovery. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Carl Anderson for any closing remarks. Carl D. Anderson - Vice President and Treasurer : Thank you, Eric. We do appreciate your participation in today's call. If you have follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me directly. And this does conclude Meritor's second quarter 2016 earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in our slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay. Jeffrey Craig : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us today. As you probably saw in our press release this morning, we had a great third quarter of financial performance. On slide 3, you can see the highlights. We reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.4%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.57, and free cash flow of $86 million. The excellent operational performance that we've maintained for many quarters continues to drive real earnings growth and cash flow. We continue to win in the marketplace and are very close to achieving our three-year goal of securing $500 million of new business wins. I'll highlight a few of our latest awards in just a moment. We also completed our $210 million equity and equity-linked repurchase program in July, building on the many achievements associated with our M2016 strategy. We are now beginning to shift our focus to initiatives that will ensure the success under our M2019 plan. As part of this plan, we expect to have continued strong cash flow performance. With that in mind, we're pleased to announce today new debt and equity repurchase authorizations. Let's move to slide 4. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $39 million or 4.7 million common shares. Based on the trading levels of our stock price, we opportunistically finished the program a quarter early. Overall, we repurchased 12.8 million common shares onto this program which equated to approximately 13% of our total shares outstanding. In addition, we bought back a total of $74 million in convertible debt which lowered interest expense, improved our debt maturity profile and mitigated long-term equity dilution risk. We continue to believe that our stock has been excellent investment given our consistent earnings and cash flow performance, demonstrated during the M2016 program. At the same time, we are committed to reducing our debt levels as part of our M2019 strategy. With that in mind, our board of directors has delegated authority for us to execute up to $150 million of debt and $150 million in equity repurchases over the next three years. These authorizations provide us the flexibility to begin taking the capital structure actions but aligned with our M2019 goals. You should expect to see us start to execute such repurchases over the coming quarters. As you know, securing new business continues to be a primary focus as we finish out M2016 and turn our attention to M2019. On slide 5, we highlight some of our recent wins. In the third quarter, we earned $25 million of additional new business wins. Part of this in incremental business is based on an award we received to supply axles and brakes for a specialized vehicle that the Volvo Group will supply to the Canadian military. We expect that production to begin in fiscal year 2017. The remainder consists of incremental sales in various Aftermarket & Trailer product lines, including an award for remanufactured trailer axles and expanding our air systems business in the aftermarket. In our specialty business, we will be supplying our tandem heavy haul axle to an OE customer for an oil and gas vehicle. With our cumulative M2016 new business awards of $475 million, we are very close and motivated to deliver on our M2016 goal of $500 million. Slide 5 provides our view of the end markets for the remainder of the fiscal 2016 with some additional insight as we approach 2017. Overall, our global forecast is relatively unchanged. As we said last quarter, in North America, excess Class 8 inventory and declining used truck prices due to softer freight demand are causing fleets to adjust their orders for new trucks. This has led to reduced build rates and OE production levels. At this time, we are guiding to 245,000 to 250,000 units, basically unchanged from our previous forecast. Last night's release of July orders are in line with this estimate. We continue to believe we're in the midst of an inventory correction in the Class 8 market. One excess inventory is depleted, we expect to see the markets stabilized to relatively normal production levels to sustain replacement demand. While we are not providing guidance for fiscal year 2017 today, we do want to give you some insights of what we are anticipating in the next fiscal year for two of our major markets. For North America, we're expecting the current headwinds to continue to create some level of downward pressure on orders and subsequent builds, particularly, in the first half of the fiscal year until excess inventory clears. And in Europe, while Brexit is certainly an unknown, we are not currently seeing any production impact as we approach 2017. We will provide more detail on 2017 later this year following our fourth quarter earnings announcement. On slide 7, we have provided an update on our M2016 score card. And once again, the main take away from this chart is that we are on track to achieve all three financial objectives this year. We have continued to improve our margin throughout M2016 timeframe, and we ended last year with a 9.5% margin. Year-to-date for fiscal 2016, we are at 10.2%, and we're remained confident in our ability to achieve the 10% EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal year that we committed to three years ago. The second financial target was to reduce net debt by more than $400 million to less than $1.5 billion. We achieved that target at the end of fiscal 2015 and we're confident we'll stay at or below that level till the end of our fiscal year. Keep in mind, our net debt definition includes our pension and OPAT. Our unfunded pension position has remained very stable throughout the year even as interest rates has declined significantly. In fact, if we were to mark-to-market our pension liability as of the end of this quarter, we estimate that this would increase our net debt by only $30 million. We have benefited from derisking strategies and strong asset performance even through the most recent quarter just ended. Our third target was to achieve $500 million of incremental booked revenue. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental $25 million of new business, we are now at $475 million, 10% of EBITDA margin, $400 million in debt reduction and $0.5 billion in new business wins. Those were our M2016 objectives. And we are positioned to deliver on all three. Our ability to achieve these challenging objectives is driven by the expertise, passion, and commitment of the entire Meritor team. As a company, we are completely aligned around our priorities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the quarter and our outlook for the 2016 fiscal year. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning. As you heard from Jay, we had a very strong financial performance in our third fiscal quarter. Let's walk through the details of our results by turning to slide 8. Sales are $841 million down 7% compared to last year. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower Class 8 truck production in North America which was down nearly 30% year-over-year. But our new business wins have significantly mitigated the impact of this sizeable market decline in North America. Gross margin was 15.1% this quarter which is an increase of 150 basis points over last year. Lower material labor and burden cost continue to drive gross margin performance. SG&A was $6 million lower compared to the third quarter last year. The decrease was driven by a $6 million cost recovery from a supplier associated with the product liability damages matter. This settlement partially offset related cost we've incurred over the last few years. We also recognized $3 million related to an asbestos insurance recovery from an insolvent insurer which partially mitigated our asbestos related cost in the quarter. While both of these cash recoveries are discrete to this quarter, they are part of our continuing focus in mitigating all costs impact in the business. Income tax expense was $8 million in the third quarter of 2016 which translates to an effective tax rate of approximately 16%, in line with our expectations. For the full year, we're expecting an effective tax rate of between 15% and 20%. The bottom line is that we generated $42 million of income from continuing operations attributable to Meritor. And after adjustments for non-cash tax expense and restructuring cost, which we've detailed in the appendix, we generated adjusted income from continuing operations of $52 million and $0.57 per diluted share, an increase of $0.15 or 36% over last year. Let's move to slide 9 which compares our sales and EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 2015. As you can see on the right side of the slide, the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange has finally moderated and with only a slight headwind on both revenue and EBITDA of this quarter. As we look forward to our fourth quarter, we don't expect FX to have a material impact on our results. Next, as I mentioned previously, we had two discrete recoveries in the quarter. These yielded $9 million of good news earnings. Further down the [indiscernible], you can see the volume and mix drove revenue lower between by $61 million compared to last year. Despite this, we were able to increase EBITDA by $3 million related to volume, mix, performance and other. This was driven by a combination of lower steel indices and strong material labor and burden performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenue. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.4%, up 180 basis points from last year. Even if you were to exclude the impact of the supplier and insurance recoveries, we still would have generated an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%. Either way, a strong quarter performance. Slide 10 details third quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our two reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $640 million, down $65 million or 9% from the same period last year. Our new business wins significantly mitigated the 30% decline in North America Class 8 truck production. We also benefited from slightly higher revenue in India as that market continues to increase on a year-over-year basis. Segment EBITDA was $61 million, up $3 million from last year, which drove an increase in EBITDA margin to 9.5%, 130 basis points higher than last year. This increased margin was primarily driven by strong cost management and lower steel indices, both of which continue to favorably impact our earnings. However, we have seen certain steel indices increased the last couple of quarters, so as we look to Q4, this will be a modest headwind to earnings. In the Aftermarket & Trailer segment, our North America Aftermarket business continues to be a little softer than we were originally anticipating. However, with the new business wins that Jay mentioned earlier, overall revenue in the segment was down only 2% from last year. Segment EBITDA was $38 million, up $7 million compared to last year. This increase was driven primarily by the $6 million supplier recovery we mentioned earlier as well as favorable material costs. Overall, EBITDA margin was 16.7% in the quarter, up 340 basis points over last year. If you were to exclude the supplier recovery, our margins would've been just over 14%, consistent with what we previously said you should expect for this business. Now, let's turn to slide 11. We generated $86 million of free cash flow this quarter, which was up $15 million from last year. We are converting our strong earnings and solid working capital performance into meaningful cash flow generation and are well on track to achieve our full year free cash flow guidance of $90 million. And importantly, we're producing this level of cash flow even as we're increasing our year-over-year capital spending to support our growth initiatives and operational performance objectives. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 12. With a couple of months left to go in our fiscal year, we now expect our full year revenue to come in at approximately $3.225 billion, down slightly from our previous guidance. Aside from the modest step down in our Brazil production outlook, our market expectations are relatively unchanged. However, as we look at the last couple of quarters in the fiscal year, we are seeing some modest mix shift in customer production that are causing a slight decline in our revenue outlook. From a margin perspective, we continue to remain on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 10%. Implicit in the full year margin guidance is that we expect lower margins in Q4 than we've seen year-to-date. This is almost entirely due to the anticipated step down of revenue from Q3 to Q4 which is caused by two things. First, our European revenue will decline due to the normal impact of European summer holidays. Second, we expect that North America class A truck production will step down sequentially as we see the continuing effect of the inventory correction that is underway. As a result of these two factors, we're expecting fourth quarter revenue of around $750 million. We're also maintaining our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of approximately $1.60 for fiscal year 2016, the midpoint of our prior guidance. Even though lower revenue will drive slightly lower bottom line earnings, we expect the EPS impact of that to be completely offset by the impact of lower outstanding shares resulting from the completion of our repurchase program. And finally, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $90 million. We generated $78 million through nine months and have clear line of sight of finishing the year strong. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig : Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 13. As we wrap up fiscal year 2016 in less than two months, we are proud of what we've accomplished during the last three years. Most importantly, we have shown that when we make a commitment, we deliver. And as we go forward, we will maintain that focus. Looking ahead to 2017, we're not expecting to see a rebound in end markets. In fact, we anticipate that the global markets would likely remain under pressure particularly as inventories continue to correct in the North American Class 8 truck market. In spite of this, we will continue to drive performance in 2017. We will maintain our focus on margin, EPS and cash flow, and we will begin executing on our capital allocation priorities. 2017 will also be an important year as we have remained committed to an aggressive product life cycle that is part of our M2019 program. These important new products represents a critical element of the revenue objective we established to grow sales more than 20% above market. Also, as part of M2019, we plan to increase EPS, achieve our leverage target for net debt, and return 25% of free cash flow to shareholders. We're confident in a strong finish this year and look forward to beginning our new three-year plan that will shift the pendulum towards growth. We demonstrated with M2016 that we know how to develop and deliver on our strategy to drive shareholder value. We plan to do it again with M2019. We'll provide more details as we begin next year. Before we take your questions, I'm pleased to share with you that our board of directors recently elected Jan Bertsch as a new Director. Jan has been Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer of Owens-Illinois since November of 2015. Prior to that, she held executive financial positions with Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, BorgWarner and the Chrysler Group. We are pleased to add Jan's experience and expertise to our board as we enter the next chapter of our success through the execution of our M2019 strategy. Now, let's take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brian Johnson : Yeah. I've a couple of questions. First, vis-\u00e0-vis Europe, your major customer has been doing well in terms of share and it's beginning to call out some capacity constraints. Are you seeing that at all and where are you capacitized versus where you think those markets and your customer share could go? Jeffrey Craig : Thanks, Brian. This is Jay. Thanks for the question. You're right. We're happy to be part of [indiscernible] group success in Europe. We have not experienced any capacity constraints on our end. I think as you know, we've made some significant investments in all our manufacturing facilities around the world, and in particular, in our Lindesberg, Sweden plant that is the primary supporting facility for [indiscernible] Europe. And we're also pleased, I should mention as well, that IVECO is doing quite well, which is also a significant customer of ours in Europe. So, we're benefiting from both of those customers having very strong performance right now. Brian Johnson : And second question also EU, the EU is tightening up CO2 standards supplying them to trucks. What are you working - what's in your portfolio and what are you working on to help your customers meet those challenges particularly around disconnecting axles and also, again, back to the key customer because overall they're trying to drive fuel efficiency technology? How will that partnership evolve as these - as they have to meet tighter fuel economy goals? Jeffrey Craig : That's great question, Brian. I think overall, as I look it at 30,000 feet, what it's done is driven our relationship closer on the technical side because if the needs to meet those requirements on both sides to the Atlantic. We've made investments in new lab equipments to help our customers measure the benefits of fuel economy increases. In addition to all the new product development we're pushing forward, you mentioned that Detachable Tandem certainly have those types of products in our future product program of plans. We talk about here on this side of the Atlantic to 14X EVO which will increase fuel economy. And also, we have a similar product on the European side called 17X EVO, which is driven as having market improvement in fuel economy. But it all fits in to what I spoke about at the Analyst Day of us doubling the pace of our product introduction over the next few years. We think we are not only meeting but exceeding our customers' expectations in that regard. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Jeffrey Craig : Good morning. Ryan Brinkman : On slide 9, you mentioned that volume, mix performance and other was a positive year-over-year contributor to EBITDA. And now this despite revenue declining $61 million year-over-year ex FX indicating volume was a big headwind. If you assume like a 20% detrimental, maybe $12 million. So, what are the other elements of these combined category that are still positive, and what additional color can you provide on what is possibly benefiting mix performance or other? Kevin Nowlan : Okay. Hey, Ryan. It's Kevin Nowlan. There are really two things. First is material, labor and burden performance. And second is really the benefit of steel indices. And so, if you look at the $61 million, I think you've done the math right. You would expect ordinarily upwards of a $12 million headwind. We've seen a three positives. So, we're up $15 million of performance items. And it's really those two things more than anything else that are more than offsetting the lower volume. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That's great. Would you expect more tailwind from steel indices going forward given - or less given some of the uptick, how do you think about that? I'm sure there's some sort of lag between spot and P&L. Kevin Nowlan : There is. And so as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, I think we're going to see a little bit of a sequential headwind coming from steel indices. Over the last couple of quarters, we've seen some of the indices particularly in the North American market creeping up. And so we would expect a few million dollars of headwind, and that's reflected in our guidance for Q4. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a last question on the regional outlook. It looks like on page 6, so you're maintaining volume across most regions, except the U.S., a slight uptick - but except for in South America, right, where you're looking for a steel [indiscernible]. Can you remind us - I know there's been some dispositions and re-organization over the years. Can you remind us of the - and then of course, it's sort of organically declined. Can you remind us of your current revenue exposure to South America and then just the principal countries and types of vehicles that we should be mindful of that you're levered to? Jeffrey Craig : As far as our revenue exposure... Kevin Nowlan : Last year, we were at revenue of about $200 million in Brazil. Jeffrey Craig : $200 million. Kevin Nowlan : And you can see what's happened in the market there. So, our revenue this year will be down about 30% in Brazil, probably in the 130s. Jeffrey Craig : And our exposure is primarily on the heavy side and less on the medium duty side in Brazil as you look at those markets. We particularly have exposure on the extra heavy side, which is doing slightly better in a very weak market right now with the wins with DAF most recently. Their product is focused on that extra heavy side and we have a little more exposure on that side. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Neil Frohnapple : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. Jeffrey Craig : Thanks, Neil. Neil Frohnapple : Hey, are you able to provide an update on the amount of incremental revenue expected to be realized in FY 2017 from the new business wins already achieved? I know you won't provide initial FY 2017 revenue guidance that's on November. What I'm just trying to get at whether you think you have enough revenue in the pipeline from new business wins to offset the further cost you alluded in your global line market? Jeffrey Craig : Neil, this is Jay. Just let me give you a couple of data points. Approximately $300 million of that new revenue win we expect to be in fiscal year 2016. And then we expect the remainder to flow through over the next couple of years. So, relatively near-term improvement. Obviously, we're repositioning, focusing on M2019 objectives and starting to refocus to develop a similar pipeline as well for that period. Neil Frohnapple : Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just talk about the increase in your North American medium-duty forecast. I mean, is that just fine-tuning the outlook based on year-to-date performance or is the outlook for underlying demand getting better? And then just is your comments about continued pressure on FY 2017 also applicable to this market? And then, I guess, just finally, can you just talk about how the launch of the 13X Axle for the medium-duty market tracking versus your expectation? Thank you. Jeffrey Craig : Sure. Thanks. Yeah. The medium-duty market, you even saw on some of the information coming out last night, has been more stable than the Class 8 market. Right now, down a bit but still even on last night's information, but it has been more stable. Our exposure to that market is relatively small compared to our Class 8 exposure. We have a couple of large customers who are associated with Navistar and Hino. We are in the process of launching the 13X Axle with Navistar and it's going very well. And we would expect to plan that launched with Hino here in the future as we go forward. And we continue that discussions with other OEs about that product because of our belief that it's a superior product in terms of performance in fuel economy and durability. Neil Frohnapple : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is now open. Colin Langan : Thanks for taking my question. Any color - can you just remind us how you're hedged for commodities? I mean, is it something impacting margins [indiscernible] on a rolling basis or do you have actual direct exposure to [indiscernible]? Jeffrey Craig : With the bulk of our OE customers we have pass-through mechanism that allows us to pass through increases or decreases as steel indices move. And those are intended to match up with our purchasing activity from our suppliers. Now, there is a lag between the cost coming through favorably or unfavorably from our supplier and the pass-through mechanism to our customer and that lag tends to be in the range of about six months. So, as we've gotten some benefit from steel over the course of the early part of this year with indices coming down we've been now giving that back to our customers through the pass-through mechanisms. And then as we look to the fourth quarter and we start to see the index tick up, we'll start to see some headwind from that, but then we would get the benefit of that from our customers back sometime during 2017, effectively on a six-month lag. Colin Langan : And when you say bulk, you mean - I mean, any percent around that in terms of percent you're directly exposed to versus the percent on pass-through? Jeffrey Craig : With our OE customers in the North America, European, Brazilian markets, really all of our OE business has done some sort of pass-through arrangement. The only businesses that aren't formally really on a pass-through mechanism would be our Africa market business with is really just more subject to the pricing pressures in that market. Colin Langan : Got it. Any color - so you completed the - correct me if I'm wrong, you completed the $210 million repurchase. You now have $100 million repurchase authorized per stock. I mean, how should we be thinking about that going forward as you try to balance repurchases versus improving the balance sheet of the business? Kevin Nowlan : [indiscernible]. I think you characterized it the right way. If you think about $150 million debt authorization and the $100 million of common equity authorization, they are authorization. They're not specific programs. They're authorization that allow us to execute on our M2019 capital allocation priorities. And you remember what those are from Analyst Day, maintaining strong liquidity, achieving BB credit metrics, returning 25% of cash flow to shareholders and supporting our strategic growth initiatives. So, what these authorizations do is they give us the flexibility to be opportunistic in executing against those capital allocation priorities which includes a mix of both taking out some additional debts to reduce our leverage because that's important to achieve BB credit metrics, as well as meeting our commitment to returning value to shareholders. You should expect us to start commencing on execution under those programs within the next few quarters. Colin Langan : Okay. Well, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning, gentlemen. Jeffrey Craig : Good morning. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning, Brett. Brett Hoselton : I was hoping you can maybe delve into a little bit more the state of your end markets, in particular, North America and Brazil. I guess what I'm really looking for is kind of a from a 30,000 foot perspective, as you look at them and the puts and takes in the industry and drivers and so forth, where do you think we're at in terms of the cycle? And again, in particular, I'm interested in your thoughts on North America and Brazil. Jeffrey Craig : Sure. Well, I'll start first with Brazil, Brett. I was down there just a few weeks back and I think what we're seeing as it appears to market has stabilized at this very low level that the inventory levels seem correct from what the demand is right now. So, if we see an uptick in demand, it should move relatively quickly into production. We're not seeing that at this point, but at least, the inventory levels seem to be balanced in the right direction. And if we move to North America, I think it's really an opposite issue. We still have excess inventory in the system. You could - depending on which figure you look at, it could be upwards to a month's worth of production, it's still an inventory that needs to clear the system. As the fleets are being very cautious, freight rates have become a bit unstable if you look at the release - the recent public earnings releases from Swift or on Knight. They're still seeing pressure on freight rates. And I think this is really going to take two things for us to see that market to begin to pick up back more to a replacement demand level. And that is that the fleets see stronger freight rates and we start to see that inventory get to a more normalized level. And so, what I'm looking towards is really to the ATA meeting in the first week of October that tends to be a good bellwether with a lot of the larger fleets placing their orders around that time period. And we should get a pretty clear view of where inventory stand at that point. Brett Hoselton : So, in Brazil, it sounds like it's stabilized. Do you have any stance as to a possibility of an inflection point at any point in time? Is there any signs that you see in Brazil that caused you to think, I think that after the Olympics are over, for example, things are going to start to improve or something along those lines? Jeffrey Craig : I'm not confident enough to stick my neck out on predicting the Brazilian economy yet. But, as I said, I think the good news is it appears the inventory levels have gotten to the right level of where we should see any upticks very quickly move in to production demand. So, that's the first step they needed to get to and they've gotten there. Brett Hoselton : And it sounds like we're still working to do the inventory here in North America, and it's probably out into your 2017 timeframe before there's even a possibility that we could see maybe your production inflection. Is that... Jeffrey Craig : I think as I've mentioned in my comments, we think the first two quarters, there remains some inventory to be cleared out of the system. Brett Hoselton : Okay. Great. Thank you very much, Jay. Jeffrey Craig : Yeah. Thank you, Brett. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Birge for closing remarks. Eric Birge : Thank you, everybody. And this will conclude our call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Smith, Vice President, Finance, Operations. Please go ahead. Mark Smith : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the fourth quarter of 2016. Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland.  Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future.  Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.  More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the SEC, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures.  Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and today's presentation, are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors and Media.  Now I'll turn it over to Tom. N. Linebarger: Thank you, Mark, for that inspiring introduction. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Our references to EBIT and EBIT percent exclude restructuring and impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. EBIT was $526 million or 11.7% compared to $531 million or 11.1% a year ago. EBIT increased as a percentage of sales as the benefits of our cost-reduction actions and the absence of a loss contingency charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 more than offset the impact of weaker volume. For the full year, Cummins sales were $17.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Our EBIT margin was 11.4%, down from 12.5% in 2015. Our decremental EBIT margin for the year was 24%, consistent with our plan even after absorbing $138 million additional accrual for the loss contingency. This solid performance reflects strong execution of our restructuring plan, material cost-reduction programs and quality improvements that helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes in very weak markets. Engine business sales declined by 10% in 2016 due to weaker production of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and softer demand for construction equipment in North America. EBIT was 8.8% compared to 9.9% in 2015 due to the impact of weaker revenues and the increased accrual for the loss contingency in 2016. Sales for our Distribution segment declined by 1% as weaker sales to off-highway markets and the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar offset growth from acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, bringing the total number of acquisitions to 13 since we announced our plan in September 2013. Full year EBIT was 6.3% compared to 7% in 2015 due to weaker organic sales and the negative impact of currency. Full year revenues for the Components segment decreased by 6% as weaker truck demand in North America more than offset strong growth in China. EBIT was 13.3% compared to 14.5% in 2015, mainly due to the impact of lower sales. EBIT in the fourth quarter was 11.9% as we incurred additional costs associated with the launch of our new Single Module aftertreatment system in North America. We do expect to continue to incur additional costs through the first half of 2017 as we resolve startup issues in our production supply chain for this important new product. Power Systems sales declined by 14% in 2016, with weak demand in most major geographies and end markets. EBIT was 7.5% compared to 8.9% in 2015 as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses achieved through restructuring and other cost-reduction activities. We continue to make good progress with our plans to exit our U.K. generator set manufacturing plant in Kent, with high-horsepower generator set assembly now transferred to our Daventry engine plant. By the end of 2017, we will complete the transfer of the remaining wide variety of small generators currently produced in Kent to existing locations in China and India. These actions will position the business for further cost reduction in 2018. Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2016 starting with North America, and then I will comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America declined 12% in 2016, primarily due to lower engine and components sales to North American heavy- and medium-duty truck market. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks declined to 201,000 units, a decrease of 31% from 2015 levels. Our market share clearly improved in the second half of 2016 and exceeded 31% for the full year but was down from 33% in 2015. 2016 marked the 10th straight year that customers have selected Cummins as the leading engine supplier to the heavy-duty truck market. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 108,000 units in 2016, a decline of 13% from 2015. We remain the clear leading engine manufacturer in the medium-duty truck market with full year market share of 75%, down slightly from 78% a year ago. 2016 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in North America, and we shipped 131,000 engines to Chrysler, slightly ahead of 2015 volumes and sold 19,000 units to Nissan in our first full year of production. Engine sales to construction customers in North America declined 15% in 2016 as the market faced an overhang of equipment inventory and it drove OEMs to cut production. Engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America declined by 14% year-over-year, reflecting weaker demand in all end markets. Revenues for Power Generation decreased by 4%, driven by lower sales to rental companies as they cut back their capital expenditures. Our international revenues declined 2% in 2016. Our full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6%, as some end markets rebounded from weak levels in 2015. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 28% for the full year as the OEMs increased production, partially driven by new regulations aimed at combating vehicle overloading. Our market share in 2016 was 15%, down from 16% in 2015 as our partner, Dongfeng, lost share in the face of very competitive pricing in the industry. Sales of our ISG heavy-duty engine grew in line with the market. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 14% while the overall market declined 1% as Foton continue to increase the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engine, displacing local competitor engine. Our full year share in the light-duty truck market exceeded 7% in 2016, up 90 basis points. Earnings at our Foton-Cummins joint ventures declined in 2016 while volumes increased. During the fourth quarter, we initiated actions to improve the performance and reliability of our ISG engine in some duty cycles. We incurred costs in the joint venture to make product changes and support customers. We expect the product improvements to be complete by the third quarter of this year and expect to incur additional costs associated with these actions until the actions are complete, albeit at a lower level than experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Despite these issues, we remain very confident that the ISG is a game changing-engine for the Chinese truck market, and customer demand for this engine remains strong. Demand for construction equipment in China improved, with sales of excavators rising 19% in 2016. This marks the first annual increase in demand for excavators since 2011, but demand remains well below historical levels. Our construction engine volumes increased by 40% as excavator demand increased and we picked up share in wheel loaders. Revenues for our Power Generation -- Power Systems business, excuse me, in China declined by 17% due to continued weakness in power generation, marine and mining markets. Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a 7% increase over 2015. Industry truck production increased 8% to 346,000 units, and our market share remained at 41% for 2016, with nearly 80% of Tata Motors trucks powered by our joint venture engines. Revenues for Power Generation increased by 2%. In Brazil, our revenues decreased 19%, driven mainly by an 18% reduction in truck production in a very challenging economy. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to be flat to down 5% from 2016. We expect market conditions to continue to be challenging in 2017, especially in the first quarter. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 178,000 units in 2017, an 11% decrease year-over-year. We expect our market share to be between 29% and 32%. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 108,000 units, flat compared to 2016. We project our market share to be in the range of 73% to 75%. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be flat compared to a strong 2016. In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be up 3% in 2017. We currently project flat demand in light-, medium- and heavy-duty truck markets. We expect our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be at least 15%, flat with 2016. In light duty, we expect our share to grow to 8%, up from 7%. We currently project 5% growth in off-highway markets in China. In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to decline 5%, mainly due to weaker truck demand driven by the transition to Bharat Stage IV emission standards starting in April. Bharat Stage IV is the first major countrywide emissions change in the Indian truck market involving the introduction of aftertreatment systems. And as a result, it's hard to predict the impact on truck demand post implementation. Truck dealers do appear to be well-stocked with new trucks, and we anticipate that any end user prebuy activity will likely be met with current truck inventories and without a significant increase in production in the first quarter. We do expect demand to drop off after the implementation of the new regulations, and we have factored in a decline in industry production of between 10% and 20% for the full year into our forecast. We currently expect growth of 5% in off-highway markets in India. Demand in off-highway markets was growing at a faster rate in the first half of 2016, but the pace of economic growth has slowed following the introduction of the government's demonetization policy. We're optimistic that the government's focus on improving infrastructure will support growth in both our on- and off-highway businesses in the coming years. In Brazil, we expect truck production to be flat in 2017. Demand is at very low levels. And while we are optimistic that the next move in production will be up, there's no clear catalyst for sustained improvement in the near term. We expect our global high-horsepower engine shipments to be flat in 2017. We expect a modest improvement in new engine orders from mining consumers while demand in marine markets remains very weak. Orders for new engines for oil and gas applications in North America also remain very low, although demand for rebuilds of existing engines has increased. In summary, we expect full year sales to be flat to down 5% due mainly to a weaker truck production in North America. We expect EBIT to be in a range of 11% to 11.5% of sales, with performance expected to be weakest in the first quarter. Through our cost-reduction initiatives and focus on operational improvements, we have effectively managed through a multiyear decline in some of our largest markets and delivered EBIT margins well above prior troughs. We have continued to invest in new products in our Distribution network that position us to drive profitable growth when end markets do improve. Demand in most of our key markets remains below replacement levels. Having said that, for the first time in a number of years, there are some early signs that point towards improvement in 2018. In addition to our strong focus on operational improvements, we have also continued to return cash to shareholders. We returned 75% of operational cash flow to shareholders in 2016, and we'll return at least 50% in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we continue to make progress in advancing our strategy as we outlined in the last Analyst Day. And although I have nothing to announce today, we are optimistic that we will continue to make progress in executing our plans. Now let me turn it over to Pat. Patrick Ward : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the full year 2016 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. All comparisons in the full year and the fourth quarter of 2015 for the company and for each of the operating segments will exclude the charges for impairment and restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2015. Full year revenues for the company were $17.5 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to the prior year. And as Tom just described, declines in commercial truck production in North America and the lowest level of demand for high-horsepower industrial engines and power generation equipment in more than a decade led to the overall revenue decrease. Negative currency movements against the U.S. dollar reduced our sales by approximately 2%. North American revenues declined 12% in 2016 and represented 58% of our total revenues, down from 61% in 2015. International revenues declined by 2% compared to the previous year, mainly due to foreign currency movements. Excluding the impact of the currency movements, international revenues grew almost 3%, with growth in China and in India being offset by weaker demand in Latin America, the Middle East and in Africa. Gross margins were 25.4% of sales and are 50 basis points lower than last year. Material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 offset most of the negative impact from lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Selling, admin and research and development costs were up 50 basis points as a percent of sales. They decreased by $145 million in the year due to savings from previous restructuring actions, which were partially offset by added expense through distributor acquisitions. Joint venture income decreased by $14 million compared to last year due to the acquisition of the North American distributors and lower earnings from the joint ventures in China. Other income expense improved by $50 million, primarily due to the change in the cash surrender value on corporate-owned life insurance plans, gains recorded on the divestiture of a power system joint venture and an increase in royalty income. In total, earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, was 11.4% of sales in 2016, down from 12.5% of sales that we reported in the previous year. The decremental EBIT margin was 24% for the full year. EBIT for 2016 and 2015 included charges for a loss contingency of $138 million and $60 million, respectively, as we previously reported. Net income was $1.4 billion or $8.23 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $8.93 per share in the previous year. The operating tax rate for the full year was 24.6% compared to 27.4% in 2015 due to changes in geographic mix of earnings. Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 6% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 56% of our fourth quarter revenues, declined 13% from a year ago as a result of lower commercial truck production in North America and weaker demand from industrial engines and power generation equipment. International sales improved by 6% compared to 2015 due to stronger demand in China and in Mexico, which more than offset the weaker conditions in the Middle East and in Africa. Gross margins were 24.9% of sales, a decline of 30 basis points from a year ago. Warranty was an 80 basis point headwind due to the variable expense recorded in the fourth quarter of '15. The negative impact from the lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by material cost savings and the benefits from previous restructuring actions. Selling, admin and research and development costs of $677 million or 15% of sales increased as a percent of sales by 60 basis points but decreased $8 million from a year ago. The benefits of previous restructuring actions offset the added expenses from the distributor acquisition.  Joint venture income of $67 million was $8 million lower compared to a year ago. Earnings declined due to costs incurred associated with quality improvements in our Foton-Cummins joint venture in China, largely offset by earnings growth in a number of our other international joint ventures. Earnings before interest and tax was $526 million or 11.7% of sales for the quarter compared to $531 million or 11.1% a year ago. Our EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2015 included a $60 million charge for the loss contingency. Net earnings for the quarter were $378 million or $2.25 per diluted share compared to $2.02 from a year ago, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%. Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the quarter and for the full year 2016 and then provide a forecast for 2017. I will then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 6% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 9% overall, with lower heavy and medium-duty truck engines sales in North America being partially offset by increased sales in bus and pickup markets. Off-highway revenues increased 8%, primarily due to higher construction sales in all regions except in Latin America. Segment EBIT in the quarter was $194 million or 9.9% of sales, an increase compared to the 7.6% that we reported a year ago. EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2015 did include the $60 million charge for the loss contingency. In addition, benefits from restructuring and material cost reduction helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes in the quarter. For the full year, revenues decreased by 10% from a year ago, and earnings before interest and taxes declined from 9.9% to 8.8% of sales. For the Engine segment in 2017, we expect the revenues to be down by 3% to 6% due to weaker demand in North America, and EBIT margins to be in a range of 9.5% to 10.5% of sales. For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, which decreased 2% compared to last year. The decrease was the result of a 6% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a 5% increase in revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter. The EBIT margin for the fourth quarter was $122 million or 7.3% of sales, an increase from 6.5% a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a onetime gain of $15 million for the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor. For 2016, full year sales for the segment declined by 1%, with a 5% organic sales decline and a 2% unfavorable impact from currency being offset by 6% growth from the acquisitions. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 7% to 6.3%. For 2017, revenue is projected to be flat to up 4%, with increased revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 expected to add approximately $200 million or approximately 3% to the top line, which will be partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. And we expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6% to 6.75% of sales. For the Components segment, revenues were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% due to lower industry truck production, while international sales increased by 13%, primarily due to a 66% increase in our sales in China. Segment EBIT was $140 million or 11.9% of sales compared to $175 million or 14.2% of sales a year ago. In addition to the impact of the lower volumes, warranty costs were higher against a very tough comparison a year ago, and we also experienced higher-than-expected startup costs associated with the transition to our new Single Module aftertreatment system, which are likely to persist through the first half of 2017. For the full year, revenues were 6% lower than in 2015. Sales in North America were down 14%, partially offset by very strong growth in China. EBIT as a percent of sales decreased from 14.5% in 2015 to 13.3% of sales in 2016. For 2017, we expect revenue to decline by 2% to 6% as a result of weaker demand in North America, and EBIT is projected to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales. In the Power Systems segment, fourth quarter revenues were $932 million, down 5% from a year ago. Sales of Power Generation equipment declined 7% compared to a year ago while industrial engines revenues were down 4%, primarily due to weaker marine and mining engine sales compared to last year. EBIT margins were 7.3% in the quarter, up from the 6% we reported last year. Lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix and the project cost overrun in the U.K. were more than offset by the benefits from cost reductions, favorable currency impacts and the gains recorded on the sale of some assets. For the full year, Power Systems revenue declined 14% from 2015, and EBIT margins declined from 8.9% to 7.5% of sales. The focus on cost reduction is key to holding decremental margins in the segment to 18% despite a significant drop in revenue. For 2017, we expect Power Systems segment revenues to be flat to down 4%. EBIT margins are expected to be between 7% and 8% of sales, which is relatively similar to 2016, given no significant improvement in our end markets. And as Tom discussed, we are on track to complete the exit of manufacturing from our site in Kent in the United Kingdom, which will yield net savings in 2018. Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operations for the full year was just over $1.9 billion. We anticipate operating cash flow for 2017 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. We lowered our capital expenditures by more than $200 million to $531 million in 2016, and we expect that our 2017 investments will be in the range of $500 million to $530 million. Last year, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders or 75% of operating cash flow. We repurchased 7.3 million shares, and we increased our dividend by 5%. For 2017, we plan to return at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders, in line with our long-term commitment. As Tom described, the majority of our businesses have experienced multiyear declines in demand. We are forecasting company revenues to be flat to down 5% this year, primarily driven by the lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market and modest declines in power generation and off-highway markets. Foreign currency headwinds are expected to reduce our revenues by approximately $200 million. We expect EBIT margins to be between 11% and 11.5% of sales this year. We do face lower volumes again in 2017, which will negatively impact our margins, especially in the first half of the year. We remain focused on cost reduction, with improvements in material costs, plant productivity and the quality of our current products helping to offset the impact of the lower volumes, cost inflation of some commodities and increased variable compensation, merit and pension expense. We do expect EBIT margins in the first quarter will be at the low point for the year and below fourth quarter 2016 levels on lower sales. Income from our joint ventures is expected to decline by approximately 8% in 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of the last remaining North American joint venture distributor. We expect our effective tax rate to be 26% this year. As we outlined in our Analyst Day back in November of 2015, we expected a period of weaker demand ahead of us. We have managed effectively through this decline in sales so far and have taken actions necessary to improve our cost structure while continuing to invest in new products and services that will help drive profitable growth when the markets improve and continuing to return value to our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Pat, and we're now ready to move to the Q&A section. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Timothy Thein : First, maybe, Tom, for you. I'm just curious maybe with respect to the kind of the tone of your conversations here and with North American customers and distributors just given what's transpired here over the last, say, 90 days or so. Just curious with respect to their overall set -- tone regarding underlying investment and just kind of a broader question. Just curious if you can address maybe what -- if there's any meaningful change in terms of their attitude. N. Linebarger: Thanks, Tim. Let me just say at a high level, as I mentioned in my remarks, our markets are at historically-low levels. We're way below replacement in nearly all of our major markets, and you heard our forecast for the numbers for North American truck. It's really weak, and that's clearly a big headwind going into 2017. And we've been sprinting for quite a few years now to keep costs under control. In fact, improve productivity and cost in all of our facilities and still be able to invest to make sure that we can grow faster than the market when things improve. So we feel like 2017 is one of those years. On the other hand, as you also heard me say, it looks like the move, next move in many of those markets is likely to be up, which I don't think we've been able to say until now. And that -- again, we're planning conservatively. We are, this year, we are assuming that we're going to get very little benefit from any of that. We are planning our costs accordingly, et cetera, but there are some good signs. I think Rich is a little closer to the -- what OEMs are saying in North America. So I'll probably ask Rich to talk a little bit about the truck market specifically and then what other signs that you're seeing, Rich. Richard Freeland : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Yes, we're hearing as I talk to fleets, more and more people talking about getting back to replacement levels, where they kind of sat out a years, their mileage was lower, and so that tends to be a common theme, not in every fleet but often. The data -- pre data looks good or at least improving a bit. Dealer inventory looks at a pretty good level. And in fact, there's room to grow the dealer inventory, which we haven't been able to say. And I think the big overhang is just used truck values are still a bit of an issue, but generally, pretty positive on the next move up. We've had 3 months in a row where the production has been less than orders. So the backlog is growing. Again, the future order board is growing for OEMs, and we're already starting to see as those order boards were getting filled out, people are increasing orders. I think maybe in some of the off-highway, I'll do quickly, but oil and gas, we actually are starting, not engine orders, we're seeing a lot of activity in the parts side. The rebuild is coming back in. And I think we mentioned in the comments, the mining business, again, I think the next move will be up there, again, a little bit. It started with parts, which is normal for us, starting to see some improvement there. So generally, I guess, positive. A couple we talked about maybe down would be India truck market, and the marine business does not look like -- that's one we'd say, we don't see that recovery coming yet. N. Linebarger: So hopefully that helps, Tim. Sentiment, good; orders, low. Timothy Thein : Yes, understood, okay. And just back on Rich's comments on part -- on off-highway parts, maybe a little bit more color on Distribution. It sounds like within that flat to up 4% -- up 3% contribution from the last acquisition. So just maybe a little bit more color in terms of -- I would have thought you would -- the outlook there would have been a little bit more positive. So maybe just some more color on specific drivers within Distribution. Mark Smith : Tim, it's Mark. We are expecting some growth in parts. The one market where we're seeing continued weakness globally is really Power Generation. So that's what's kind of tempering the outlook in the near term. Richard Freeland : Well, target range [ph] in sales is generally through the Distribution business, and I think we're looking at that being down again this year, I think 3% to 4%, something like that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jamie Cook : I guess, 2 questions. One, on the guidance, then the second, more strategic one. If you look at your engine sales in the margins and implied decrementals, the decremental seemed normal. But then if you back out the charges that we had in '16, the implied decrementals, I think, are in the mid to high 30s, which seems -- it seems like it should be better than that. So I'm just wondering if I'm missing something, if you could explain that. And then my second question, Tom, relates more to you. If you look at the past 3 quarters, the repos really falling off, we're not really doing much. So are we -- can you give us an update on sort of where we are? Are we closer to doing a deal? And I guess, as I also think about how you're thinking about the company going forward, I always thought maybe you'd potentially just acquire a business, but I never really thought about whether the parts of the business that don't make sense for Cummins to be in anymore and if so, why would that be? Is it for because you want to do a larger deal for cash because certain businesses aren't generating the proper returns? So I guess those 2, and if you could help [indiscernible] Patrick Ward : Jamie, I'll take the first one, and then Tom can take the second one. So on decrementals, let me kind of give you a high-level dredge for the company. It really applies to the Engine segment as much as the company. So if you start from the 11.4% of EBIT that we reported in 2016, we do have headwinds coming through in the form of the lower volume, the unfavorable mix and some of those launch costs that we're talking about with our new products. That's about 70 basis points of a headwind between those 3. We do have higher inflation cost in terms of people costs in 2017, and they're coming through in the form of higher pension expense given the lower discount rates, higher variable compensation in 2016 and then merit increases, so -- and people cost inflation. That's about 120 basis points year-over-year. And then we had some onetime gains in 2016 over about [ph] 30 basis points, and they came through in the form of some of that fair market value gains in Distribution and the gain on sale of the Power Generation asset in the fourth quarter. Offsetting most of that are cost reductions really coming through material costs. We're looking at 80 basis points this year. That's down from 150 basis points last year really given the swing in metal markets. We had 50 basis points of improvement last year in metal markets, 20 basis points negative this year. So net, 80 basis points on cost reduction. The loss contingency that we pointed out is worth 80 basis points. And then pricing, we're thinking some modest pricing improvements that would add around 30 basis points. So when you net all that together, that leaves us somewhere in the midpoint between 11% and 11.5% of sales. Jamie Cook : Okay. That's helpful. On the M&A front, any potential for divestitures? N. Linebarger: Yes. So let me first just talk about the repurchase of shares. We have continued with our plans on repurchased shares. As you know, we set a goal at the beginning of the year. We drive that program to achieve that goal. We have guidelines that we run with the board about price ranges that we're acquiring in, and we try to make sure that we stay within that, and we run programs through the year. So when you see differences in repurchased shares by quarter, that's more to do with just when we're taking the actions and more the mechanics of it than it is to do with where we've lost interest. We're still hitting our targets for the year of how much we want to repurchase, and so that wouldn't change our strategy at all on that. That's continuing. And then secondly, with regard to the acquisition front, as I mentioned, we are actively working on those strategy areas that we talked about in the Investor Conference, and I'm feeling like we're making good progress. And as I've said before, the problem with describing progress in this publicly is until I have something to announce, I can't announce anything, which is very frustrating to you and other investors I know and frustrating to me, too. But again, all I can do is share my sentiment, I think, at this point, which is I feel like we're making good progress, which means that I think we'll be able to add to our growth platforms at -- within our very tight constraints about making sure they're strategically good and also helps investors with returns over the medium and long run, if not the short run as well. And then last thing, you asked about divestitures. And as we described in the Investor Conference, we review our portfolio of businesses every year. And often times, that review doesn't yield very much. And sometimes, it makes us think more. But always, what we're looking at is what are the businesses that we have, and we have a 3-part criteria. One is, are they a strategic fit? Meaning, are we able to create more value with that business because we're the owner, because of the things that it links with and the competencies that we share across the business? Two, is it meeting our return guidelines? Or do we know, through management action, how to get it to that place? And three, is there some way that we can potentially add to our growth platforms or otherwise by reconstituting that business in some way? So we're pretty active at reviewing that portfolio, and we do it every single year. So we did it again this year, and we're always active on that and very much like the acquisition front, of course, until we are actually doing anything, there's actually nothing I can say publicly. It's bad for our employees. It's bad for everything else. So we aren't going to say anything until we do something. But again, I just want you to know, as someone who writes about us, and I want our investors to know that we always think we should evaluate our portfolio to make sure, as a management team, that we are actively managing the businesses that we're in as well as managing each one we have for success. Mark Smith : I'm just going to respond to your first question, Jamie. My calculation shows in the low 20s decrementals on the engine business. We can maybe follow up on that later, but those are pretty normal levels, I think. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew Casey : A couple of kind of cleanup questions, I guess. The contingency charges, you had some in a few historical quarters, are we clear of those? Or is there some risk those could come back in 2017? Richard Freeland : Okay, yes, Andy. Yes, we believe we're clear of those. So the process is we booked what we think was the estimated charge, and there's been no change in that. Andrew Casey : Okay, Rich. And then on the Beijing Foton JV, you talked about the costs incurred to improve some productivity and other stuff. How are those going to -- first, could you quantify those in the fourth quarter, because it was pretty sharp falloff? I just want to make sure there wasn't anything else going on. And then how should we expect that JV contribution to kind of play out through 2017? Does it start out weak and then get back to where it should be through the year? Richard Freeland : Okay, let me take that, and Mark, if you need to correct any of my numbers, jump in. But yes, so on the ISG, we did take a charge in Q4. And to quantify it, it's roughly $25 million. And so just reminding folks where we are on this product, we remain very excited about it. In fact, our share of Foton now is over 75%. But frankly, we've run into issues in certain duty cycles as we've added more applications in certain regions where either fuel quality or service practices or things we've learned. And so we wish that wouldn't have happened. That hasn't changed our fundamental view. And so I think there will be a charge in Q1 but to a lesser degree, think of kind of half that and all that eliminated as we go into kind of Q2 and Q3 -- on the ISG. And so our strategy hasn't changed. Just like we did on the 2A, 3A, went in China with a brand-new product for the market, compete there and then take the product globally. So we've done that on the 2A and 3A. We're producing 150,000. Quite frankly, we went through a little bit of an issue on introduction as we entered new markets on the 2A and 3A inside China, but we're now selling 50,000 of those outside of China even at Euro 5 and Euro 6 levels part of our strategies. We'll do the same thing on ISG. It hasn't changed our approach. Mark Smith : And I would just add, we've assumed flat markets in heavy, medium and light duty in our guidance. Even in that environment, we'd expect earnings growth in light duty with projected share gains. But as Rich said, improving earnings as the year unfolds. Andrew Casey : Okay, Okay, great. And then lastly, a similar question that I think Tim asked with respect to North America. Could you kind of discuss what you're seeing in China at this point? You clearly indicated construction equipment's coming back. Truck had a fairly good second half to the year last year for market basis, yet you're talking about, as you just said, Mark, kind of flat markets for truck in China. What's kind of going on over there? Richard Freeland : Yes. So we're projecting flat although I would say our sentiment, even as weeks go by, gets a little bit more positive more than negative, Andy, on this. And there's been -- the new weight restrictions that were put in place are healthy, and so they're being enforced. So I think there are some signs of positiveness, but we just haven't -- we're staying fairly conservative on our forecast just on what the sustainability of that is. There's still some questions. I know there's some ranges. There's people who are more positive than us in the truck market right now. We're going to plan around flat. From a capacity standpoint, of course, we can flex up, and we'll beat it if it's better than. N. Linebarger: In the construction market, Andy, it is improving. But just remember, where we're starting from is a far, far cry from where we've seen good markets there before. So yes, we're pleased to see them move up, but it's got a long way to go. And I think it's going to be pretty gradual in its improvement, too. It's just that in the overall market, there's a lot of overhang of equipment still. There's still a lot of dealer inventory. There's a ways for the industry to go. But again, we're happy to see the improvement up. Mark Smith : Yes, there's not a lot of momentum in the high-horsepower side, I would say. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you could talk about your updated timing of the 12-liter engine production ramp in U.S. truck. It sounds like the quality issues in China are unrelated based on the description that you laid out, Rich, but maybe you can update us on the time frame. And also, do you have new platform opportunities with Volvo now that they're exiting their 16-liter engine in the U.S.? Richard Freeland : Okay, yes. Jerry, yes, so first, they clearly are unrelated -- the quality issues. We're going out taking care of customers, again, kind of related to specific -- either regions or duty cycles in China. Nothing's changed on our schedule. So we'll begin some -- you'll see some trucks here late in the year. It'll be not material in 2017, but we do have agreements with multiple OEMs to begin offering it and remain very excited about it. From the question on heavy-duty on Volvo, we're exclusive on 15-liter with 2 customers with Navistar and PACCAR. And so I am pleased to say we'll now be exclusive on a third, with Volvo, with their announcement of discontinuing the 16-liter. Jerry Revich : And Rich, sorry, just the number of platforms that you'll be available on, can you give us just a rough flavor? Richard Freeland : I'll say -- at least 2. Jerry Revich : Okay, okay. And then coming back on the M&A discussion, you folks have been really focused on driving structurally-higher returns on capital over the course of your time leading the company. And I'm just wondering, are you signaling a longer-term focus on returns on capital, with potential to absorb lower returns near term as you build a sort of meaningful growth platform via acquisitions? Or maybe you could just talk about if you folks are changing the framework in terms of the time frame of which you're targeting the types of return on capital that you folks have generated internally. N. Linebarger: I'm definitely not trying to signal or change anything. We've always had a medium to long-term view on return of capital. That's never changed. As you know, we operate a cyclical company and things do go up and do go down even in our own returns on capital. We have long return cycles in our business, as a matter of course, which, of course, is frustrating and difficult to manage, frankly, but it is just the case that we have that. So I'm definitely not trying to signal anything. As we talked about when we talk about potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other partnerships is that we have high return guidelines. We believe that we serve investors well when we retain that attitude that we need to earn good returns on capital with new things we do, just like we do with existing things we do and that taking long ventures into things that don't generate a return would not be good for shareholders, and we're not going to do it. You also know that if we're going to do -- make investments in inorganic that we have to put together a plan that we think works for shareholders or it doesn't make sense. And what that means as far as short term and medium term and long term depends. We'll see when we get there. But just -- I just need you and everyone else to know that we are not backing off anything with regard to our view about generating strong returns for shareholders, and we won't as long as I'm here. I can tell you that. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Joseph O'Dea: Specifically on Power Gen and looking for another down year in '17, could you talk about just how depressed that business is. I think we're now looking at 5-plus years of declines -- so what the declines look like from peak. And then beyond the general macro, what signs you're looking at for conditions to start to turn there, whether it's by end markets or geographies, but where we can start to look for some hope in Power Gen given the multiyear declines that we've seen there? N. Linebarger: Maybe, I can start just from a high level. I would say that, as you quite rightly said, it's been a long term. We've got 5 years in a row really of very weak markets driven by low investment -- capital investment and especially in developing markets, where we have strong positions, but also nonres capital spending. So those 2 trends have been a strong negative for the business for some time. And with regard to how depressed it is, we're pretty depressed about it. I'll let Mark give you like the -- how much percentage down, but we have certainly have a lot of capacity and -- which is why we took the action we did last year, again, to restructure our capacity and try to reduce costs in a way that allowed us to ramp back up when things get -- turn up again. We still remain highly confident in the business's underlying economics as those economic drivers return. For one thing, we see that the demand for electricity in most of our -- most markets, certainly in developing countries, increasing in terms of the amount of the economy that depends on more reliable power. We also see investments in more reliable power declining as economies decline. So we still believe that in most world economies, they'll be relying on some form of grid support, either through standby generation, other more sophisticated needs for data centers, et cetera, or just in terms of straight backup power in some regions where they have much, much less reliable power. So we believe that those fundamental things are in place, but it has been a long, tough decline, and we've worked actively to try to reduce the impact of those declines, but it's been a tough run. Mark, do you want to comment on all about percentages? Mark Smith : Yes, you're talking about over 30% down from prior -- 5 years ago. And again, that sort of business that isn't depending on one part of the economy or on one particular cycle or down cycle. I think, as Tom said, in some cases, it's not always a lack of demand. Like in Latin America, there's a lot of demand. You've just got, in that case, a lot of customer liquidity issues that are holding back the movement of projects this year. And starting in early last year, we had the Middle East that was doing quite well and then that started to roll up. So it's just been a combination of circumstances. I would say Europe's stable. North America's stable but down a little bit. So it's really the emerging markets, as Tom said, over the last 3 years to 4 years. Joseph O'Dea: And then on the tax rate and looking for, I think, 26% in 2017, should we think about that as being more representative of the tax rate on a go-forward basis? Is there anything unique in 2017? But just you go back a year ago, I think you were looking for something more in kind of high 20s range. Just want to think about this on kind of a longer-term outlook and what the right tax rate is. Patrick Ward : Well, the only thing that's different -- There's 2 things are different in 2017 compared to what we said 12 months ago. One, we have a lower share of profits coming out of the U.S., which, as you look out, a higher tax rate today. And secondly, there has been some changes over the last few months in the U.K. and some legislation there that does impact our investment [ph] . So that's the real reason for the delta between the 24.6% that we reported for '16 and the 26% for 2017. The biggest factor is going to be the geographic mix of earnings over the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : My question's about the component guidance. It appears to be implying a decremental margin of 55% on a 4% revenue decline. I just want to get more color on why do you think the decrementals would be that poor. Richard Freeland : David, this is Rich. I'll take that. Really 2 -- fundamentally, 2 things. One is, volumes down again in North America is what we're projecting. And then two is, as was mentioned, some startup costs associated with our new Single Module aftertreatment in our aftertreatment business. And so just to remind you, we're making a really big change there, and it's not a small change in our aftertreatment. One, it's at half the size, half the weight, taking the maintenance intervals up by a factor of 2. So it's a brand-new product, and we've had some startup kind of expedited costs and all that we had in Q4. And I mentioned those will continue into Q1. So those are the 2 things that are happen -- that are really dragging that down for 2017. David Raso : How much are those investments? Because even if I hit you with a 30% decremental, it adds almost $0.20 to your guidance for the year. So I'm just trying to think about how big those costs are just so I can get a better feel for how reasonable the guidance is. Richard Freeland : Well, the aftertreatment piece of the startup, we're talking in the $20 million to $30 million range for the year, and then you know what our incremental margins are, and you've seen before as volumes come back. So if volumes come back to more normal levels, when and if that happens, then you'll see that turnaround. Patrick Ward : Yes. The other thing I would throw in there, David, too, if you go back to my answer to Jamie Cook earlier on, we are seeing some inflationary metal markets, which is impacting the segment, and we are seeing some impact on compensation inflation, too. So there's 2 or 3 headwinds that's impacting us in 2017. We'll figure our way through then get back to normal markets. Mark Smith : But you should see improvement in the second half versus the first half. David Raso : Yes, and not to nickel and dime you. Even with that cost on the startup, you're still implying decrementals over 40? I'm just trying to make sure -- I mean, is the inflation problems particular to components more than other segments? N. Linebarger: No, it's not. So again, just thinking through your view of our guidance. Again, as I've said kind of as an overview, we're taking a pretty conservative view of bad markets. And so I think the biggest opportunity we have in the Components business is that North American markets strengthen more and faster than what we have in our guidance, and you probably have a reasonable view about your opinion on that. So that would be one thing that you could take a look at if you wanted to. But again, our view is that we're going to continue to manage conservatively. We're going to continue to find ways to take costs out. So again, as you know, we are not satisfied with decremental margins of that level. We're not pleased with that. We are working hard to figure out how to make that less of an impact, but we're giving you the forecast based on what we think we understand how to do right now. We'll continue to work on decremental margins in that business. That's a very -- it's a very profitable and good business for Cummins, and we're going to continue to make it so. David Raso : And last quick question on the M&A conversation. How do you think about strategically off-highway versus on-highway, just all the secular issues that we're all aware of on-highway as well as some of the benefits you've built up with your Distribution acquisitions? Just how should we think about those 2 markets and how they impact your strategy? N. Linebarger: Yes. So on-highway, as you said, it's a bigger volume. It's -- so it tends to drive a lot of the technology, and there's -- there is -- of course, we have a very strong position on on-highway, and the fact that we lead in emissions and other technologies has helped us build a strong position there. On the other hand, as you've quite rightly said, in off-highway, there is less vertical integration, and also our Distribution is well positioned globally to serve a bunch of markets that other people can't serve. So both have important roles in our strategy. And frankly, we think one of the advantages of Cummins is we're able to put the 2 together in a way that drives synergies that most others can't. So as I think about it strategically and I think about things we might do more of, I'm thinking about both those areas and how we can continue to use the synergy between the 2 to drive more returns to shareholders than others can. Mark Smith : I think we're at the top of the hour. Thanks, everyone, for your questions, and Adam and I will be available for follow-up later. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Vice President of Financial Operations, Mr. Mark Smith. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Smith : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2017. Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We'll all be available for your questions at the end of the prepared remarks. Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the meaning of Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available on the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the SEC, particularly the Risk Factor section of our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.  During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements, and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors and Media.  Now I'll hand it over to Tom. Thank you. N. Linebarger: Thank you, Vice President Smith. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide you a summary of our first quarter results as well as some comments on our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.  But before I provide my comments in the quarter, I'd like to talk about a recently announced agreement with Eaton, to form a joint venture to design, develop and manufacture automated transmissions. We are very excited about this joint venture with Eaton, and we have provided some additional slides on our website, which lay out why this joint venture presents a significant opportunity for Cummins. The strategic rationale for the joint venture is simple. Since fuel is one of the largest cost drivers for our customers, fuel efficiency will be a primary differentiator of commercial powertrains across our global markets. Cummins and Eaton have been partners for decades and today, offer the leading combination of engine and transmission performance in the North American heavy-duty truck market. We believe that the next-generation of transmissions designed, developed and manufactured by the joint venture, combined with Cummins capability and system integration, can yield significant improvements in fuel efficiency for Cummins and our OEM customers and partners.  Cummins will invest $600 million for a 50% share of this joint venture. And in return, we'll be able to develop integrated powertrains that offer a significant performance advantage, add to our portfolio of technology offerings to our customers and benefit from the value created by the joint venture as it leads the secular shift to more automated transmissions. Eaton will contribute the current design for the next-generation heavy-duty automated manual transmission if current automated manual transmission meet for medium-duty markets call to precision specific manufacturing assets as well as intellectual property and people associated with the development, testing and assembly of automated transmission. The joint venture has a clear path to profitable growth, and we'll benefit from accelerating transition from a fully manual transmission -- excuse me, to automated transmissions from fully manual transmissions in global markets. We expect that the next generation of products with advanced performance will gain market share, and a joint venture will leverage Cummins' strong position to grow in international markets where the penetration of automated transmission is currently very low.  The joint venture will also capture aftermarket revenues. We project that the joint venture can more than triple its current sales of approximately $300 million over the next 5 years. Cummins will consolidate the results of the joint venture within the Components segment, and we expect that the joint venture will be operational in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals.  Now let me turn to our first quarter financial results. Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2016 and stronger than we anticipated 3 months ago. EBIT was $566 million or 12.3% compared to $484 million or 11.3% a year ago. All 4 operating segments increased sales, EBIT dollars and EBIT percent. Our incremental EBIT margin was 28%. Engine business revenues increased by 2% in the first quarter due to strong sales to construction customers, especially in China. EBIT for the quarter -- for the first quarter was 11.3% compared to 10% for the same period in 2016, with the increase due to profitable growth in our off-highway business and strong performance in our on-highway joint ventures in China.  Sales for the Distribution segment increased by 12% with organic sales growth of 6%, driven by stronger demand for engine rebuilds, parts and new engines on on-highway markets. We acquired the last remaining joint venture distributor in North America in the fourth quarter last year, and this acquisition contributed 6% to growth. First quarter EBIT was 6.1% compared to 5.9% in the first quarter of 2016 and improved as a result of the higher organic sales. First quarter revenues for the Component segment increased by 9%, primarily driven by strong growth in sales to Chinese truck OEMs. EBIT for the first quarter was 13.3% compared to 13.2% in the same quarter a year ago and much improved from the fourth quarter last year when we incurred additional launch cost associated with our new single module aftertreatment system in North America.  We made clear progress in reducing the cost of the single module and improving supply chain performance in the first quarter. And we expect to see further improvement in the second quarter. Our system sales increased by 9% in the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in new engine and aftermarket sales to mining and oil and gas customers. EBIT in the first quarter was 6.5% compared to 5.7% a year ago due to the benefit of higher sales and lower operating costs. During the quarter, we had disappointing performance on a large power project in the U.K., and excluding the impact of this single project, first quarter incremental EBIT margin was 40%. We expect profitability to improve for the rest of the year and again in 2018, as we get the full benefits from the restructuring of our U.K. generator set -- assembly operation, which continues to progress on schedule.  Now I will comment on our performance in some of our key markets for the first quarter of 2017, starting with North America, and then also discuss some of our largest international markets.  Our revenues in North America increased 1% in the first quarter with higher sales from the distribution -- distributor acquisition more than offsetting lower Engine and Component sales to the North American heavy- and medium-duty truck markets. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks declined by 20% in the first quarter of 2017 while our sales of heavy-duty engines declined only 12%, as our market share for the quarter improved to 32.7% from 29% a year ago. Production of medium-duty trucks declined 6% in the first quarter while our engine shipments declined 9% with our market share of 72%, down from 76% a year ago. Our shipments of engines to pickup truck customers in North America declined by 1%, but we remain on course for a strong year in this segment. Engine sales for the construction market in North America increased 10% in the first quarter, reflecting increased customer confidence after a challenging couple of years in which the market had to absorb an excess supply of used equipment, resulting from the slowdown in oil and gas markets. Shipments to high horsepower markets in North America increased by 42% compared to very weak levels last year due to the higher sales to oil and gas and rail customers. Revenues for Power Generation declined by 1% with growth in consumer markets, offset by lower sales to data center customers.  Our international revenues increased by 17% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.1 billion, an increase of 49% due to growth in our on-highway and construction businesses. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 73% for the first quarter, driven by a higher pace of infrastructure investment and truck replacement in response to overloading regulations introduced last year.  Our market share for the first quarter was 14%, down from 15% last year. Sales of our ISG heavy-duty engine to Foton grew in line with the market, but growth in Dongfeng's truck sales were not as strong as the industry as a whole. Last quarter, we discussed actions that we were taking to improve performance of the ISG engine in some applications, and we have made good progress in executing on our plans to support customers who are able to reduce the cost of these actions below our initial expectations. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 22%, well ahead of the overall market growth of 12% as Foton continued to increase the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines. Our market share during the quarter was 7.6%, up a further 60 basis points from a year ago. Demand for construction equipment doubled from a year ago in China in response to stronger infrastructure investment. Our construction engine volumes increased by over 300% as OEMs ramped up their production of excavators. Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 3% due to continued weakness in Power Generation, marine and mining markets. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $408 million, a 5% increase from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production declined 3% compared to a strong quarter a year ago while our market share increased 1% to 39%. Revenues for Power Generation equipment increased by 9%. We also grew sales in marine and rail markets as a result of growing infrastructure investment.  In Brazil, our revenues increased by 13%, all driven by appreciation of the real as end markets remained very weak. Now let me provide an overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to increase 4% to 7%, higher than our prior guidance of flat to down 5% with a modest increase in our projections for a number of regions and end markets. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 195,000 units, up from our prior forecast of 178,000 units in 2017 but still down 3% from last year and below replacement demand. We expect our full year market share to be between 29% and 32%, unchanged from our previous projection. In the medium-duty truck market, we have raised our outlook for the market size to be 112,000 units, up 4% to 2016 and up from our prior guidance. We project our market share to be in the range of 73% to 75%, consistent with our view 3 months ago. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to increase 1% for the full year.  In China, we expect full year domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to grow 11% compared to our previous guidance of up 3%. We have raised our outlook for demand for medium- and heavy-duty truck markets to exceed 1 million units, a 7% increase from our previous guidance. Our forecast anticipates the demand for trucks will slow from first quarter levels due to normal seasonality and a slowing of truck replacement. We expect the light-duty truck market to grow 3% in 2017 compared to our previous guidance of flat. Our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck market we expect to be 15%, flat with 2016. And in light duty, we expect our share to exceed 8%, up from 7% last year. We currently project 10% to 15% growth in off-highway markets in China compared to our previous guidance of up just 5%, primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment. In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat compared to our previous projection of a 5% decline, due mainly to a stronger rupee. We currently project 5% growth in off-highway markets, offset by an expected 10% to 15% decline in truck demand. In Brazil, we expect truck production to be flat in 2017, unchanged from our previous projection with no clear signs of improvement in the near term.  We expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to grow 10% to 15% compared to our previous guidance of no growth in 2017. Demand has picked up in mining and oil and gas markets compared to extremely weak levels last year.  In summary, we expect full year of sales to increase 4% to 7% compared to our prior forecast of flat to down 5%. We are experiencing an increase in some commodity costs, which we are working hard to mitigate. Rising commodity costs should be supportive of growing demand for capital goods but in the near term, will likely reduce our net material cost savings in the second half of the year compared to our original expectations. Our forecast for EBIT is now in the range of 11.75% to 12.5%, above our previous guidance of 11% to 11.5% of sales. During the quarter, we returned $222 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plans to return at least 50% of our operating cash flow this year. We're off to a solid start, and I look forward to updating you again next quarter. Now let me turn it over to Pat. Patrick Ward : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's first quarter financial results before discussing the performance of each of the 4 operating segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of the year. First quarter revenues were $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% from a year ago after 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, the longest period of year-over-year revenue decline since 2002. The sales in North America, which represented 57% of the first quarter revenues, increased 1% from a year ago primarily due to increased revenue in the Distribution segment, which more than offset lower Engine and Component revenues due to a decline in heavy- and medium-duty truck production compared to the previous year. International sales improved by 17% from a year ago primarily due to increased sales in China and in Europe, which offset weakness in the Middle East.  Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, unchanged from last year. The benefits from increased volumes were offset by warranty expense, which was a 50 basis point headwind, as we increased accrual rates with new engine introductions and recorded   non-favorable change in estimates on older engines. Selling, admin and research and development costs of $695 million or 15.1% of sales decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points but increased by $39 million from a year ago mainly due to higher compensation expense. Joint venture income of $108 million increased by $36 million compared to a year ago as a result of strong market demand in China for both on- and off-highway equipment.  Earnings before interest and tax improved to $566 million or 12.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 11.3% a year ago, and this reflects a 28% incremental EBIT margin.  Net earnings for the quarter were $396 million or $2.36 per diluted share compared to $1.87 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, in line with our full year guidance of 26%.  Moving on to operating segments. Let me summarize their performance in the quarter, and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some comments on cash flow for the quarter.  In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 2% from last year. International revenues were up 11% primarily due to growth in off-highway markets in China. Revenues in North America declined by 1% due to lower on-highway revenues as a result of the lower production of heavy-duty trucks. Segment EBIT in the first quarter was $229 million or 11.3% of sales. This compares to 10% of sales from a year ago. The margin improvement was driven by higher joint venture income, favorable pricing and material cost savings, which were partially offset by a higher warranty cost and an increase in current product support expense to support recently launched products.  For the Engine segment in 2017, we now expect revenues to be up 2% to 6% compared to our previous guidance of down 3% to 6% with -- due to an improved outlook in most of our markets. Our forecast for EBIT margins is to be in the range of 10.25% to 11.25% of sales compared to 9.5% to 10.5% previously. For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.6 billion, which increased 12% compared to last year. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 6%, and revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 added an additional 6%. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $100 million or 6.1% of sales compared to 5.9% a year ago. The improvement to margins from an increase in sales during the quarter was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs from the integration of previous acquisitions.  For 2017, Distribution revenue is now projected to increase 4% to 8% compared to our previous guidance of flat to up 4% with the increase driven by improvements in off-highway markets and higher parts sales. We still expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6% to 6.75% of sales as higher variable compensation and benefits offset improvements to operating margins. For the Components segment, revenues were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, a 9% increase from a year ago. International revenues grew 25% primarily due to a 60% increase in sales in China, which more than offset a 2% decrease in North American revenues due to the lower heavy- and medium-duty commercial truck production. Segment EBIT was $179 million or 13.3% of sales compared to 13.2% of sales a year ago. As mentioned in our previous call, we did incur additional expenses to support the launch of our Single Module aftertreatment system, but we were able to mitigate part of the cost we previously forecast while still meeting the delivery commitments in the quarter.  For 2017, we now expect revenue to be up 6% to 10% compared to our prior guidance of a 2% to 6% decline. The change in guidance reflects stronger-than-anticipated demand in the China truck market and improved outlook for the North American heavy- and medium-duty truck market. EBIT is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of sales compared to 11% to 12% in the previous forecast. In the Power System segment, first quarter revenues were $882 million, an increase of 9% from a year ago. The increase in revenues for the segment was driven primarily by a 28% increase in industrial markets led by mining and oil and gas with growth in new engine and rebuild revenues. Global Power Generation markets remain weak despite a slow revenue gain in the quarter. EBIT margins were 6.5% of sales in the quarter, up from 5.7% last year due to the increase in industrial engine shipments. For 2017, we expect Power Systems segment revenues to be up 1% to 5% versus the previous guidance of flat to down 4% due to increased customer demand from mining and oil and gas engines in addition to higher part sales. EBIT margins are still expected to be between 7% and 8% of sales with this segment experiencing a more significant increase in commodity costs than we anticipated at the start of the year. For the company, we are raising our outlook for revenues to be up 4% to 7% versus our previous guidance of flat to down 5%. The increase is primarily due to improving off-highway market demand, stronger-than-anticipated growth in China and a more resilient North American truck market. Foreign currency headwinds are expected to reduce revenues by approximately $180 million, slightly lower than the $200 million impact in our previous forecast. The guidance provided today does not include the impacts from the announcement of the Eaton-Cummins joint venture. We will provide a forecast upon regulatory approval of the deal. Income from the joint ventures is now expected to be relatively flat from last year. Our strong results in China will offset the impact of the acquisition of the last remaining North American distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016. We now expect EBIT margins to be between 11.75% and 12.5% for 2017, up from our previous forecast of between 11% and 11.5%. The increase in profitability reflects increased outlook for both the global off-highway markets and the North American truck market. Finally, turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities for the first quarter was $379 million, which was a 42% increase from a year ago.  We anticipate operating cash flow in 2017 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditure during the quarter was $81 million, and we still expect investments to be in the range of $500 million to $530 million this year. And as Tom said, in the first quarter, we returned $222 million to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. And for 2017, we plan to return at least 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders, in line with our long-term commitment.  Now let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Smith : Okay. Thank you, Pat. And we're now ready to move to the Q&A section of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher : Wondering if you can give us a sense of the visibility you have on oil and gas and mining rebuilds for the rest of the year. Clearly a source of strength in the quarter, and obviously an ideal scenario would be that you get these Power and off-highway going at the same time as you have on-highway. Would that be a scenario that we see later in the year? Richard Freeland : Okay. Steven, it's Rich. Yes, we're off to a good start on the oil and gas rebuilds. In fact, they're off some relatively low numbers that is up 300% right now. And it's pretty broad-based. So we're seeing that kind of across geographies, although primarily North America, but across geographies in North America. What we also saw in Q1 is some new orders for new frac rigs. And so that is a little less broad-based. We've seen that with 1 or 2 customers, and that's the one kind of yet to be determined is kind of the rate of new versus putting idled equipment back to work. But I think the rebuild piece will continue through the year. Steven Fisher : And that's what you have baked in your 10% to 15% for high-horsepower for the rest of the year? Mark Smith : Well, that's the engine shipment, Steve, not rebuilds but the overall -- it's embedded in the Power Systems guidance. Steven Fisher : Okay, and just, Tom, last quarter, you stated a lot of dealer inventory in construction in China. So, I guess, how surprised are you that the China construction was so strong? Was this further building of inventories? Or is it all getting deployed on projects? And then what does that imply for your second half expectations? Richard Freeland : It looks to be not an inventory build. It appears to be that of the inventory we -- is a little higher than what we thought. It seems to be, again, a little more broad-based on the construction side. We were surprised by it. Okay, it was not in our forecast. But there seems to be a little more sentiment, maybe not data, that says that this could continue on the construction side, in the excavator side in particular. N. Linebarger: Steve, utilization rates are definitely up, and so that's a good sign. That means people are using the equipment there in addition to buying some new. So that's a good sign. I think it's worth us being cautious just to see where dealer inventory levels are and to understand all that, but we definitely saw sell-through higher and we saw utilization rates higher, both of which are a good sign. Question is how lasting is it, and how healthy are the dealers and how's the inventory looking? We've still got some more work to do to understand that because frankly, we were surprised by the uptick. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jamie Cook : I guess a couple of questions. One relates to your full year guidance. When you guys guided last quarter, you said the first quarter should be the lightest for a number of different reasons. Yet, if we look at your margins for the quarter, they came in at like 12.3%, which is the midpoint of your full year guide. So something doesn't seem right. Maybe we're conservative, maybe the cost on ISG and the single modular treatment system was lower in the first quarter than we thought. So if you could just sort of walk me through the guidance and whether there's potential for upside. And then, I guess, my second question, Tom, specifically on the Eaton-Cummins joint venture, just a little more color, I guess, I'm looking at it, you're paying $600 million for potentially $900 million or more of revenues 5 years out, which just seems, I don't know, light or expensive to me. So are there incremental positives that perhaps the market is underappreciating? And I don't know what... Patrick Ward : Jamie, this is Patrick. Let me start -- Sorry, let me start with... Jamie Cook : Sorry, I don't know what your assumptions are behind that. So sorry, go ahead. Patrick Ward : Sorry, I interrupted you there. Let me take the first question, and then Tom can take your second question that I rudely interrupted. So on the full year guidance, the first quarter includes very strong earnings from China and our China JVs in particular. And traditionally we tend to see a mix of 60% of China revenues in the first half of the year, 40% in back half of the year. We are a little bit hesitant to assume that the strong demand that we're seeing through the first quarter, what we'll probably expect to see in the second quarter and will continue into the second half of the year. It's close to [ the announcements ] overloading regulations come into play that's clearly been a factor that'll be driving that. So we are saying second half earnings will drop in China from first half. And that's probably the #1 reason why we are -- maybe our guidance feels a little bit weaker in the second half of the year. The other fact that is material cost, which drove 80 basis points of margin improvement in the first half of the year as we see rising commodity prices through the year. For the full year, we expect that to be nearly in line with a 50 basis point improvement. So other than that, everything else should continue much as we've seen so far. N. Linebarger: Jamie, thanks for your question on the Eaton JV. So here's the -- and again, in simple terms, we're convinced that leading powertrains will be integrated. That will be industry-wide, that will be whether you have a diesel engine driving at a fuel cell or a battery. We think integrated powertrains will win. So and that's basically performance quality, all the elements that we think make a difference. And as you know, as a company, we have continued to invest in the components that we think are essential to driving performance in fuel efficiency and emissions for powertrains because we think that's what made us successful in differentiating in a market of integrateds with a powertrain focus. So we think we have to have an integrative powertrain. So as we discussed in New York a couple of years ago, that we've been focused on figuring out ways to do that, and we looked at every single option available to us and explored every option in detail. And we felt like, given the consolidation of the industry, it's already highly consolidated and it's going to consolidate further, both strategically and technically, we needed to figure out a move into powertrains. And our view is that this is by far the most attractive entry point that we could find. And we looked at everything. And so we feel really good about this. Good because we think we're getting leading technology that's implementable right now, that we are partnering with a customer -- I mean, a partner that we feel we have a strong -- it's just cultural share -- we share cultural values, we operate successfully in the past, we know each other well so we can ramp up very quickly. And lastly, we see opportunities for growth outside of the base plan internationally as those markets begin to ramp up into automated transmission. And then we think by providing a better powertrain, our view is we can grow engine share. And of course, that's the big variable in the mix. The variable that's hard to calculate in here is what happens to our engine share with and without this joint venture, and we are 100% convinced that when you start looking at that, this deal looks not only attractive to Cummins but essential to our strategy. Jamie Cook : Is there any way you could provide a range of how the range of where market share should go? Like just the variability around that? So the joint venture could make more sense. Can 30% go to 40% in heavy-duty? Or is it in China? I'm just trying to think about how to justify the investment. N. Linebarger: I think we will as the joint venture begin to talk about what our growth plans are, et cetera. We need to complete the transaction. As you know, there's a series of regulatory approvals in front of us. And before those are completed, we need to -- we just need to say the main things and then do our legal work. When that's done, I believe we'll be able to say a lot more what we plan to do together. And I'm 100% convinced that the shareholders of Cummins will believe that this was an essential move and a good move for the company. And I believe the shareholders of Eaton will agree with that. So I feel again very excited about this joint venture. And again just from a financial point of view, it doesn't take a lot of math to figure out how this could be attractive for Cummins. Again, you basically have to understand that or agree with the basic premise that this is essential to being successful in powertrains. But once you do that, I think it works -- it's pretty straightforward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Could you do us a favor and just comment on a little bit more on pricing versus input costs? Could you quantify the impact of higher input costs and when you would expect to be able to offset the higher input costs? And then as a follow-up, I get a lot of questions recently on penetration of electric vehicles and autonomous driving, et cetera, et cetera. Could you just maybe comment on Cummins perception of the penetration of electric vehicles in particular, particularly in long hauls? Mark Smith : Ann, this is Mark. So on pricing would be probably closer to net neutral for the year on pricing across our various segments. Where we're having the biggest challenges is, as Pat mentioned, the cost is rising particularly in the Power Systems business, and as you know, we're experiencing still weak global demand in Power Generation. So it's -- when you've got persistent weak demand, you've got that balancing act to choose, Ann, which you want to press the price lever. So we'll continue to evaluate what options we've got there. And as we've said, well, hopefully that's going to be supportive of growing capital goods demand going forward. But definitely, less of a net favorable in the second half than the first half. N. Linebarger: And Ann, this is Tom. Thanks for your question on the technology area. So not surprising, I guess, in our strategy work, we've done several years of work now developing both projections and analysis of substitute technologies that might play a role in our end markets. And we are convinced that electrification, specifically, will substitute in some of our applications over a period of time. And again, our projections for that depend on large degree, as you guess, on how battery and power electronics costs come down and performance goes up, especially the energy side, how much I can store and then also the cost of fuel and other kinds of environmental-related costs. But assuming most of our scenarios come up with electrification playing significant role in cities, especially stop-and-go applications, bus, maybe refuse, pickup and delivery trucks, we think it will play a significant role, especially after it makes major substitution in cars since that will drop cost and increase volume. And we intend, by the way, to compete in that business and win. So we have already launched a electrification business development area in our company, it's people dedicated to not only launching the fully electrified powertrains but are currently selling those powertrains to some customers. So we intend to compete and win. These are our markets, buses, refuse vehicles, we are the leader in those markets. So we intend to be the leader in those markets when they're electrified. And we already have pilot products running with fully electrified powertrains designed and built by Cummins. So we will compete in those markets, and we believe we'll win. And so the fully integrated powertrains, as I was mentioning to Jamie, we think are Cummins' future be they diesel-driven, battery-driven, or otherwise. We also think, by the way, fuel cells could potentially play a role in longer haul. One of the challenges for battery driven longer-haul trucks, which is I think might be obvious in your question, is that you use most of the weight that you would otherwise carry goods for batteries. And so right now, it doesn't look like that's a winner based on the technologies that are available now or in the foreseeable future. Whereas fuel cells, I think, do a better job of -- still heavier than diesel because the fuel necessary but closer and some of the same advantages as other electrified powertrains. But there's a long way of development to go on fuel cells. They're not nearly as close from a cost performance and quality point of view as batteries are. So both of those technologies, by the way, I mentioned electrified powertrains and fuel cells, are feasible and could play a role. But both are relatively modest sellers today even in the car side. So it'll be a number of years. We know from a natural gas front that even when things are very attractive, it takes a long time to substitute in mature markets. And right now, neither of those technologies is attractive. So there's work to do to make them more attractive, and then there's work to make them work in commercial operations in a sensible way that will work for commercial operators, who, as you know, are very sensitive to capital returns. So I think they'll definitely play a role. It's going to be some time before the markets are large enough to make a big dent, but we intend to lead in both. And we are putting together the technologies and the customers to be able to do that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Tom, for your significant joint ventures in the past, you folks have been able to deliver mid-teen margins by leveraging SG&A. And I'm wondering in the Eaton-Cummins joint venture, would you folks expect a similar profile once that business ramps? Or is there anything structurally different on the joint venture either in pass-through calls or R&D intensity that we should keep in mind as we move towards hopefully the 5-year revenue targets that you laid out? N. Linebarger: Absolutely the same approach, Jerry. As you said, this one because we have a lot of upfront development to get the products to markets. It'll be heavier on R&D expense in early years, but as the revenues ramp up, we expect to be at very similar margins. And again, that's a little bit why we feel confident with this. It looks like a lot of things we have done before with a partner that we really like working with and know very well. So we have every expectation we'll be able to operate at similar margins as JVs we've operated before. Jerry Revich : And Tom, how back-end loaded is the ramp? Do we have to look for a significant new product introduction cycle so we're -- see a bigger contribution in terms of the growth rate 2020, 2021? Or can we see it kick in potentially sooner? N. Linebarger: There's at least 18 to 24 months of developments dominating the expense ratios in the joint ventures, so that is awhile. I mean, from that point of view, we have a lot of work in front of us to do. Again, a lot of the work has been done on the base transmission, but there's a lot of work to do for integrating with customers. And I think that's, again, likely to take us 18 to 24 months, and then we'll start to see the ramp up more significantly. So again, we'll be able to say more about that as the joint venture closes and then we can talk a little bit more about who our customers are and all those sorts of things. But I think just generally speaking, it's first couple of years with more light development, and there'll be sales, of course, but there's going to be pretty heavy development costs. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then, Rich, China Foton Cummins that you folks had warranty issues that you're working through last quarter. Can you give us an update on how the business performed this quarter? Were there any warranty or product introduction-related costs and the outlook for those costs over the next couple of quarters? Richard Freeland : Yes, thanks, Jerry. Just to remind you, we talked about we had some specific issues in some different regions and different markets, duty cycles we're working through and incurred some cost. And the good news is we've worked through those faster and actually been able to reduce the cost of doing that. As I talked last quarter, I said we'd be living with those through the first half of the year. And so we're really pleased that we got through it well, took care of customers and generally, by the end of Q1, have any unusual cost behind us. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Ross Gilardi : I'm just wondering if you could talk about capital allocation from here. I mean, you made an investment that you think is very attractive, but you haven't added the leverage that you initially identified that you'll be willing to consider. So should we be anticipating other acquisitions from here? Are those leveraged targets you talked about a year, 1.5 years ago still kind of in the game plan? Or is it just the valuations across a lot of the areas of interest have become too expensive, and we should sort of expect Cummins to go back to returning more cash? N. Linebarger: Thanks for the question, Ross. So the answer is we are still pursuing our strategic areas that we talked about 1.5 years ago. I think maybe as you saw in the Eaton joint venture and our powertrain expansion, we think to do a good deal takes more time than to do a lousy deal, or at least that's what we're seeing in the market. To your point, valuations are pretty high in some places. So in typical fashion, to do the things that we think adds strategic growth and profitable growth to Cummins and good capital returns just turns out are taking us some effort to work through. And that's, I guess, that's probably to be expected. But we intend to continue to pursue those areas. And yes, the leverage targets we laid out to you are still what we think makes sense for the company. We haven't changed that at all. And we have a number of things that we're pursuing right now that we hope to be able to turn into attractive projects for the company. But as you suggested by your question, we look through a lot of things that turn out to be less attractive, frankly, from a return point of view and therefore, pass them by. So I think we are active still. I'm confident that we're going to find other good things that will add to the growth and profitability and return profile of the company. But it's taken some effort and some work to grind through those, and we're still active in them though. Ross Gilardi : And then just as a follow-up on that. There were some news reports a couple of months ago about the potential sale of, I believe your filtration business. And I don't know if you can comment on that, and if you can't, just wondering is there any reason to anticipate that Cummins would ever consider a sizable divestiture if you don't actually have a larger target on the horizon, given the strength of your balance sheet today? N. Linebarger: Yes, thanks. That's a great question, Ross. The filtration business is not for sale as we said then, so I'll just repeat that. The second thing is that we don't -- we would not link our sale of a division with the need to acquire another division, another business. And the reason is as you remember from the strategy discussion 1.5 years ago, we have enough debt capacity and capital raising ability to acquire a company that we would be interested in, at least the ones that we're considering. We have enough with our existing balance sheet and cash. So we just don't see that as necessary. We would consider selling parts of Cummins in the same way as we always have, which is if we believe that a division is no longer strategically essential to the company, in the sense that it's not making the whole greater than the sum, which has been kind of the way we thought about our business for a long time. If it's not doing that, then if we think the shareholders would benefit from the price that we can get versus what we can generate internally, we'd sell it. And we do a review of our big divisions across the company every single year with that exactly in mind. So we believe that the shareholder -- we owe the shareholders that work to say are -- is the current portfolio of Cummins best owned by Cummins and by the shareholders or should we sell something to realize value and then put it to work in a new and better way. So we go through our divisions and look at those, and so we would always -- we always do that. And if one of them ended up in that box that said it's not strategic and we think we can get a better valuation, at the very least, we would go test to see if we can get that valuation. And if we could, we would sell it. And if we couldn't, we would not. So that's something we do as a matter of strategic practice. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : So my first question is around mining. So I thought it was good that you guys went through with [ Reynolds ] in oil and gas for rebuilds versus OE, but we've heard from some mining OEMs that OE activity's actually picking up a bit so I'm just curious if you're seeing something similar? Richard Freeland : Yes, Nicole, we are. So it's -- again, like in oil and gas, we're seeing it first on parts, which we started to see, in fact, last year. And that's continued. So our part sales are up double digits in the high-horsepower space, mostly driven by mining and oil and gas. And so from the engine side or the OEM side, we're now projecting up 10% to 20%. So we are seeing some of that kind of come through and a little less of the idled equipment to deal with that we have in the oil and gas business. So early days, commodity prices are up. And so there's certainly more activity and more discussion, and we're starting to see it in some orders. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, got it. That's really helpful. And, I guess, my second question is just around China. So last quarter, you guys talked about a competitive pricing environment within China truck. I'm just curious if that's continued into the first quarter? Or if you've seen that eased? Mark Smith : I don't think it's impacting our results right now. So that probably there hasn't been significant change at this point in time. N. Linebarger: Yes, most of that was related to market share acquisition by one OEM of the other that launched some new models, that we're trying to acquire. And with the new regulations that are requiring -- on overloading, that are requiring some fleets to actually purchase new trucks, our expectation is that pricing competition will ease. But frankly, we were even surprised by the size of the growth in the truck market in the first quarter as we were with the excavators. So we have some work to do to understand how well that's going to hold up and how pricing markets are just reflecting back on the first quarter. But right now, we expect the pricing to ease under the circumstances. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Just a couple of quick follow-ups, and Tom, I apologize, I'm a little bit slow this morning, but I want to make sure I understand with this Cummins-Eaton joint venture, what does this allow you to do that you weren't doing before because I think you already had a pretty close relationship with them previously, and I'm curious why you felt the need to sort of allocate all this capital to this? N. Linebarger: Yes, it's a great question, Steve. From our point of view, like with most of our Component businesses, we always have the choice of purchasing outside or bringing something inside. And we typically bring it inside if there's -- if 2 conditions are right. One is that we believe that because of our knowledge of engines and systems, we think we can make a better product for ourselves and for others. And we believe that's true. Now we believe that in integrated powertrains that we can impact the design of the transmission in a positive way by what we bring to the table in terms of engines. Now we can't, of course, do that through partnerships, it's just not as efficient and not as effective to do. So when we think we can make a big positive impact technically, then we want to be bring them in. Second thing is that we believe, in this case, that together, we can offer an integrated powertrain with features that are harder to negotiate on when it's commercial negotiation. We're adding software features, control features, which, frankly, are difficult to price across markets, and we want to make sure that we can do that and win market share in the market and come up with an effective package that includes those features, and which is hard to do so with a commercial arrangement only. I think -- and on the same front, we want to invest in those technologies and features, but we want to make sure that our partners felt that investing was going to earn a return for them. And it wasn't as clear over the long run that they felt that way. So to make sure we could add the technology we want, develop the features, price for the features, et cetera, and to make sure that we can offer a better powertrain we felt the need to bring them in. And again, as I mentioned to Jamie, we spent a long time understanding this, looking at different ways to do it, everything from developing our own solutions to acquisitions and joint ventures in different parts of the world with different partners. And we decided in the end that this was by far the best choice. And I think from Eaton's point of view, they see it in much the same way. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, good. That definitely helps. And secondarily, I'm just curious, you talked a little bit about electric drivetrains and fuel cells and so forth, and interesting to hear that you're already sort of testing this stuff. But I'm wondering if you feel like you have internally that kind of core competency that you need there? Or is this a situation where ultimately, you're going to have to either acquire or a joint venture or something in order to be able to do what you need to do with those alternative type drivetrains? N. Linebarger: Yes, I think it's much like the situation we just spoke about. Our view is that we have the capability to integrate today, just as we have the capability to integrate a powertrain before. But we will likely want to acquire some subsystems of electrified powertrain to make sure that we not only can do it, but we can do it better than everybody else. So I think it's right what you said that the capabilities that we need to outperform everybody else, we will have to acquire or develop those capabilities in-house for some of the subsystems, things like battery control, packaging, power electronics, especially for the size of the commercial vehicle. These are things where there are suppliers today in the market, but those technologies will develop the fastest and our ability to have the best ones of those subsystem technologies and integrate them the best will certainly require us to invest more in those areas. Whether that means acquiring a company or joint venturing again or otherwise hiring and developing our own will remain to be seen. But we are active in all those spaces to figure out exactly that. Again, there's time in front of us, but we -- so we can produce one now and a good one. But we want be the winner, as I mentioned, which means we're going to have to be expert in some of those subsystem technologies just as we are with diesel, just as we are with natural gas. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Barclays. Robert Wertheimer : Thanks for the discussion on the sort of forward-thinking strategy. It's very interesting. Tom, if you were rumored to be spending 2/3 of your time on acquisitions, over the past year or 2, do you anticipate that to be just as intense now? Or does the Eaton JV fill a big enough hole that there's a total little bit less? And secondarily, and you've touched on this, but I mean, do you see more opportunity or more need in acquiring things related to hydrogen or related to electric or related to whatever versus maybe the upside of acquiring pools of revenue where you can operate the business a different way about? N. Linebarger: Thanks, Rob. I thought where you were going with that is since you spent 2/3 of your time, and all you've got is one joint venture to show for it that you weren't sure the time was well spent, but I'll just assume you didn't mean that. So there is no change in my focus in terms of time. So this joint venture with Eaton is a really important strategic move as I mentioned. We feel very good about it. It only addresses a portion of the strategy areas that we discussed, and so we have a lot more work to go. So I have not slowed down at all. And the answer to your question about which of those is more interesting to us is both. So the way that, I guess, I think about it is that we have things that we need to do to acquire capabilities in order to stay the course. In order to be the leading company in what we do now, we have to continue to develop technologies and in some cases, joint venture and acquire technologies in some of these new technology areas and things like that just as we were just talking to Steve and earlier with Jamie. But we also need to look at opportunities to leverage our capabilities that we have now and potentially expand into new revenue pools. Both of those things are essential for our growth and development as a company. So our -- we're thinking of growth and capability building, both as part of our strategic effort, and I think the Eaton joint venture demonstrates some of both. And so you'll see us continue to look at both as essential to the company's future. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew Casey : Just a couple of follow-ups. The JV stuff has been asked and answered several different ways. But in the near term, it looks like your Power Systems outlook is not anticipating much over the next 3 quarters, and part of that might be this uncertainty that you described with respect to China. But I'm wondering why not more a follow-through given your comments on oil and gas and mining. Richard Freeland : Okay. Yes, Andy, it's Rich. Well, again, I think what we have seen is in the Power System area, our part sales are going to be up 16% this year. So we're seeing this kind of broad-based activity, which activity is a precursor, hopefully, to new equipment going in. And so, until we see it, I guess we're not putting that in the forecast. And like I talked in oil and gas, we've even had some indications that this was kind of a onetime bit until some equipment gets rebuilt and refurbished. So we're just paying attention. I think there needs to be some prolonged commodity prices staying higher for a bit longer for the people who are going to make the capital investment. Until we see that, we'll put it in the forecast. And lastly, you know we're prepared for it. So we've got capacity in place, and one of the things we always try to do is be the best at responding when it comes back. And even if we get surprises, if it comes back quickly, which it does sometimes, we'll be ready for that. Patrick Ward : The other challenges, Andy, at these low levels, even though mining and gas, oil and gas are improving, still 2/3 of the revenue are tied to Power Gen, which at least for now remain fairly muted. So that's what -- that and the commodity cost, these are the factors we're trying to weigh in the outlook for this year. Andrew Casey : Okay. And then another detailed question on warranty, the 50 basis point headwind that you called out in the quarter, and maybe you discussed this, but I missed it. How much of that was the adjustment, meaning the onetime? And how much is kind of go forward for the rest of the year? Patrick Ward : The onetime adjustment, Andy, was probably close to 2/3 of it, maybe a little bit more. So that's onetime that will not repeat, has been through for the rest of the year. We did anticipate higher rates, higher expense in the first quarter. As we launch some new engines and we do increase our rates when we launch engines, I think, you'll see warranty come down in the second quarter to more normalized levels, so to speak. Mark Smith : Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. Adam and I will be available for your call later. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Meritor, Incorporated Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin. Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is a property of Meritor, Inc.

Let me now refer you to slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Carl, and good morning. On slide 3, you'll see that this was another strong quarter for us. Sales were $806 million, down slightly on lower production in the North American Class 8 truck market. Adjusted EBITDA was up $1 million from the same quarter of last year, resulting in a margin of 10.2% despite the fact that we booked a $10 million for a legal contingency accrual in the quarter. As a result of our performance in the first half of the year and our forecast for the second half, we are increasing our guidance for the full fiscal year. Continued operational performance combined with an expectation of higher Class 8 truck builds in North America and increased revenue in Europe gives us confidence that we will achieve full-year results at the top end of our prior outlook. Kevin will give you more color on our financial results and what we're seeing in the global end markets. In addition to our financial results, we also had several other highlights in the second quarter driven by our focus on customers and products. As we demonstrated consistently quarter after quarter, our global team is driving improved results. Alignment to M2019 and the drive for the success that I see in Meritor employees every day is continuing to differentiate us in the commercial vehicle business. In that regard, we are proud to tell you about three distinguished awards we recently received that are shown on slide 4. As you know, we have a long-term relationship with Navistar that we greatly value, particularly in terms of our mutual interest to look towards the future and collaborate on designing products that meet our customers' strategic priorities. In February, Meritor was among the top 2% of Navistar's supply base to receive the Diamond Supplier Award. We are proud to supply Navistar with a variety of products. Just last week, we announced that Meritor's 13X single-drive axle is now available to be spec'ed on Navistar trucks. The 13X designed specifically for medium-duty applications is 59 pounds lighter and 0.5% more efficient than our previous offering. It's engineered for multiple applications, including pickup and delivery, beverage, utility, school bus, construction, and ambulance. And a few months ago, we announced that Meritor's high-performance EX+L air disc brakes are now available on International LT Series tractors. XCMG is another important customer to Meritor. In addition to being our key joint venture partner in China, XCMG recently honored us with the excellence supplier award that recognizes its top supplier in delivery, quality, and product performance. We look forward to further enhancing our relationship with XCMG, one of the largest construction machinery companies in the world, as the construction markets in China begin to show signs of a slight improvement, which encourages us for the rest of the year. We also received an important industry recognition this quarter from Heavy Duty Trucking Magazine, which ranked Meritor's MFS+ Series front-steer axle as one of the top 20 products for 2017. This award honors the most innovative new products that address industry issues and help fleets improve their bottom line. The MFS+, which we launched last February, is 85 pounds lighter than our previous offering, providing fleets with a more efficient product. We appreciate each of these significant awards and recognize that continuous improvement is necessary to meet our customers' expectations in a constantly evolving industry. When we launched M2019, we told you we would be more aggressive in our product launch cycle than in the past, which would contribute to our revenue growth objective. We are on track to launch 20 new products across the front drivetrain, rear drivetrain, and specialty. On slide 5, we highlighted three products that were launched in the second quarter for three different applications. The 14X HE for linehaul, the P600 tridem for heavy-haul and off-highway applications, and the MTec6 for trailers. The 14X HE is designed to improve our axle efficiency up to 1.5%, while also reducing weight by 30 pounds over the current market-leading 14X design. Based on today's diesel prices, a fleet with 1,000 trucks equipped with the 14X HE could realize $1 million per year in fuel savings. The P600 Series tridem axle for heavy-haul, oil field, mining and logging applications begins full production in June at our Laurinburg, North Carolina plant. High capacity, reduced fleet time, aftermarket parts availability, and Meritor's leading field service and support make us a strong competitor in this market. And the MTec6 axle being produced in our Frankfort, Kentucky facility is now available for our trailer customers. This axle is 40 pounds lighter than the industry standard 5-inch axle, which reduces gross trailer weight to enhance fuel economy and available payload. These are three products from our pipeline that we've now launched. Slide 6 and 7 provide a look at some of the new business we're awarded this quarter. In total, the wins on these two slides are expected to amount to just over $70 million of incremental business in 2019. We continue to grow with strategic customers like Volvo, Daimler and PACCAR, whether through new products or the addition of existing Meritor products to applications in other regions. It was exciting to see Volvo launch its new UD Con Truck in Japan three weeks ago, which incorporates Meritor's global axle and brake platforms. Volvo is the first OEM to offer disc brakes as a standard feature in the Japanese market, and they are depending on the proven performance of Meritor's disc brake. We are also supporting Volvo in Thailand and India. Expanding our customer base remains a focus for us, and we are having success in that area. You can see a couple of examples of that here, with Veera Vahana, an India-based bus manufacturer and JAC Motors, a Chinese manufacturer of medium and heavy-duty trucks. And we are working hard to grow our Aftermarket business. This quarter, we earned a new private label business in Europe. We also recently launched a new e-commerce platform called meritorpartsexpress.com, that makes it easier for U.S. and Canadian customers to shop for Meritor aftermarket parts on their computers, smartphones, and tablets. In our components business, we have a small win this quarter, and we have a new specialty in off-highway contracts in North America for which we'll be supplying our MX-810 axle and P600 tandem. Also, while not incremental, we recently renewed a contract with Hino in North America, resulting in a five-year extension of our current business, which includes front and rear-dressed axles for Class 6 and Class 7 vehicles. As we said, the majority of our new business is back-end loaded in M2019. The wins on these two sides demonstrate the progress we're making to strategically grow our business in each of these areas. Now, before I turn the call over to Kevin, I wanted to make a few brief comments about the recent ruling related to our UAW Retiree Medical Benefits. On April 20, in a 3-0 decision issued Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the prior lower court decision was reversed, and the court held that our collective bargaining agreements did not vest the plaintiff retirees with lifetime medical benefits. We are encouraged by the Sixth Circuit Court's recent decision, which we believe will eventually provide us with the opportunity to amend our UAW Retiree Medical Benefit plans based on the needs of our business. But at this point, we're still in the midst of a litigation and the plaintiffs in the case have not yet exhausted the appeal's process, which includes the potential filing for a petition for a rehearing en banc with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result, it's premature to speculate on the outcome. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, which includes investing in new products and technologies that drive top line growth, improving bottom line earnings, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Overall, we had another quarter of strong execution. We expanded margins, generated positive cash flow, and continue to make good progress toward our M2019 targets. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 8 where you'll see our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $806 million in the quarter, down 2%. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a lower commercial truck volume in North America. This was largely offset by increased production in Europe, India and China in addition to new business wins coming on line. Although revenue was down slightly, we were able to expand gross margin as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points. We accomplished this by continuing to drive lower material, labor, and burden costs that helped to offset the impact of lower revenue as well as higher steel prices which were a $6 million headwind in the quarter. In addition, we have favorable mix in our truck business, which also helped to drive higher contribution margins this quarter. As you can see from the right side of the slide, we did book a onetime $10 million legal contingency charge related to a dispute with our joint venture partner in Mexico. We've been in litigation since 2014 with our partner over certain product manufacturing rights. The legal contingency charge reflects our best estimate of the cost to reach an agreement to resolve this issue. We expect that this matter will be settled in the coming months, but given where we are in the discussion, we accrued this expense in the current quarter. Moving down the (13:30), we had $2 million of favorability in the line item volume, mix, performance and other. This captures the strong operational performance and favorable mix I mentioned earlier which more than offset volume declines and the $6 million steel headwind. Foreign exchange was a tailwind in the quarter, driven by $2 million hedge mark-to-market gains in the second quarter of this year and the corresponding $2 million mark-to-market hedge loss a year ago. The hedge gains this year relate to foreign exchange options that protect against the strengthening Indian rupee as we have shifted some of our supply base to India over the last few years. The hedge losses from a year ago were related to certain earnings translation hedges we had purchased to protect against the risk of a weakening euro and Swedish krona. Next, you can see that SG&A excluding the impact of the legal contingency was a $4 million tailwind this quarter, driven by lower net investments expense. Income tax expense was $13 million in the second quarter of 2017, which translates to an effective book tax rate of 36%. Compared to last year, our tax expense was up $6 million on similar pre-tax income. The primary driver of the higher tax expense was increased earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions particularly those in which we're not currently a cash taxpayer. However, it's important to remember that given our current tax position, this tax expense does not reflect the actual cash taxes we pay. That's why from an adjusted income perspective, we continue to back out the noncash tax expenses associated with the utilization of our deferred tax assets. The impact of this in the second quarter was $6 million, which means that after this adjustment, our effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $82 million, which resulted in a 10.2% adjusted EBITDA margin, up 30 basis points from last year. And adjusted income from continuing operations was $32 million or $0.35 per share, down $0.06 from last year. Slide 9 details second quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $620 million, down only 2% from last year despite Class 8 truck production in North America being down 20%. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, down $2 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Industrial came in at 8.7%, down slightly from a year ago. The margin decrease was driven primarily by the legal contingency charge and higher steel prices, which were almost entirely offset by material, labor, and burden performance, foreign exchange, and favorable mix. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $215 million, roughly flat compared to last year. In this segment, we experienced higher aftermarket revenue, which was offset by lower trailer production as the U.S. trailer market was down 10%. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 14.0% compared to 12.8% in the same period last year. The margin increase was driven by favorable labor and burden performance. Turning to slide 10, total free cash flow was $21 million, very similar to what we generated last year. As part of M2019, we continue to invest in the businesses, evidenced by capital expenditures of $23 million this quarter. In total then, we generated $44 million of operating cash flow this quarter, equal to our performance last year. This performance was consistent with our expectations and keeps us on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow guidance. Turning to slide 11, I wanted to highlight our debt maturity profile and liquidity position as we executed a few relevant transactions this past quarter. First, we refinanced our U.S. revolver, which resulted in an increase in the facility size to $525 million and extension of the maturity to 2022, and a reduction in both drawn and undrawn pricing. Second, we extended our \u20ac155 million Swedish factoring facility to 2020. And finally, we paid down a $6 million debt maturity in Brazil in the quarter. Under our M2019 strategy, we continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation and are driving to have strong BB credit metrics by 2019. As we continue to generate positive free cash flow, we will be opportunistic in repurchasing debt as well as buying back common stock. The main takeaway from this slide is that we continue to maintain strong liquidity and have limited funded debt maturities over the next four years. Turning now to slide 12, you'll see that we have revised some of our market assumptions for our fiscal year 2017. In North America, inventory levels appeared to have stabilized, while net order intake in our second quarter was up 25% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. We are seeing the effects of this coming through our order boards right now and believe that the next couple quarters will be stronger than we were anticipating. As a result, we are increasing our Class 8 production outlook to be in a range of 205,000 to 215,000 units this year. We are also increasing our production estimates in Europe to be in a range of 440,00 to 460,000 units, up 10,000 units from what we had previously thought. Truck registrations, replacement demand, and the current economic environment continue to have a positive effect on the demand for trucks across Europe. In addition, certain key customers in the region are performing quite well. All of our other market assumptions are consistent with our previous expectations. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2017 outlook on slide 13. As Jay told you, we are raising our fiscal year 2017 revenue and earnings guidance to be at the top end of our previous range. Based on stronger U.S. and European markets and our continued success in driving new business wins into the P&L, we now expect revenue to be approximately $3.1 billion for fiscal year 2017. From an earnings perspective, we are now anticipating incremental steel headwinds of $10 million to $15 million relative to what we were previously expecting. So, we now believe steel will be a $25 million to $30 million headwind on a full-year basis. However, the increased revenue outlook combined with continued operational performance is driving earnings higher. That's why we're taking our guidance up with EBITDA margin of approximately 10% and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $1.40. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I did want to remind you that in our third quarter last year, we had $9 million in favorable supplier and insurance recoveries that we don't expect to repeat. So, as you think about our year-over-year performance for next quarter, you should consider that last year's results create a difficult earnings comparable. Finally, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged with a projected range of $50 million to $70 million. Even with our projected capital expenditures of $90 million and some investment in working capital to support higher revenue outlooks, we expect our cash flow to be solid for the full year. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter and in the first half of the year. We're particularly happy to be in a position to raise our guidance for fiscal 2017. On slide 14, we wanted to highlight for you a couple of important events coming up later this year. The new NACV Truck Show in Atlanta will be a great venue for us to showcase our products currently in production and those we will offer our customers in the future including electrified drivetrains. We hope to see you there. Then in December, we'll host our Analyst Day event in New York. We look forward to giving you a detailed M2019 update at that time. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Neil. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : If we exclude the $10 million in legal contingency in the quarter from Commercial Truck & Industrial, I believe you would have delivered over a 10% EBITDA margin in the quarter despite Class 8 truck production being down over 20%. So, just curious on why the implied EBITDA margin for this segment wouldn't be higher in the back half of the year because I do believe that implied a meaningful step-down particularly in light of increasing NAFTA Class 8 production. And I appreciate the incremental steel headwind you called out, but versus the first half of the year, I don't think that's incrementally that materially different. So, if you could just help us out with some of the puts and takes there that would be helpful. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Okay. Starting with your first point about the legal contingency, I mean, you're right, our results would have been considerably stronger if we didn't have the $10 million item in the quarter, and that would have impacted the truck segment. Now, keep in mind, if we didn't have that $10 million item, we probably would have been trending quite a bit higher relative to our internal target. So, we probably would have had some sort of an offset in our incentive compensation accruals that would have mitigated that a little bit. But directionally, you're right. We would have had a considerably stronger quarter both on an overall basis as well as in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment. As it relates to looking forward, steel prices have escalated even in the quarter. If you look at scrap, for instance, it's up almost 50% sequentially from last quarter to this quarter. And if you look at a lot of the other indices around the globe, they're up anywhere from 10% to 30%. So, we have seen sequential step-ups in the indices, which is higher than what we were anticipating a quarter ago. So, we are looking now at the back half having a bigger headwind from steel in the range of $10 million to $15 million incremental to what we are previously expecting. But we are expecting to overcome that with a stronger revenue and a stronger performance. And so, if you cut through the math of what we're saying from a guidance perspective, through six months, we're at 9.7%. In the back half of the year, we're effectively guiding to something in that 10.2%, 10.3% range even with that steel headwind coming into the P&L. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just want to ask a bigger picture question. I mean, it's been almost a year-and-a-half, I believe, since you launched M2019, and it certainly will require some significant earnings growth in 2018 and 2019 versus the guidance for this year. So, maybe, Jay, can you just talk about your confidence still in hitting the EPS target of $2.84 and whether any of the key buckets within the earnings bridge are performing better than are worse than expected. And again, look, I believe expectations are that North America truck should be up a lot in 2018, so that will certainly help close the gaps, but just curious more from an aspect of things at Meritor if you control. And certainly, it does sound like you guys are launching new products on schedule, but any more color there would be helpful. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I still have a high degree of confidence of achieving targets we set out for M2019. I think there are some areas where we seem to be overperforming to-date, and that's on the cost improvement side. I think we're seeing a little higher cost reductions than we anticipated and our planning cycles on material and labor and burden. I think we're very pleased particularly this quarter with the new business wins of $70 million. So, we're starting to see our initiatives take hold in almost all markets around the world, as I mentioned significant new business wins not only here in North America but in Japan and in India and in Europe. So, I think we're starting to see the fruits from the investments we're making in new products that are targeted at specific markets. And also, the global market recoveries are falling right in line I think with what our market expectations are for the end of that planning cycle. So, overall, I think we still remain very confident of achieving the targets, and everything so far has fallen within what we expected when we set the plan up. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thanks very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. In your commentary, you mentioned the legal settlement. Can you just remind us if you do get that reversed, how much of a benefit in terms of reduction of OPEB that would be? And any color on how long it might take to get through the final review? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, I think it's probably premature, Colin, for us to speculate what the benefits could be until we get a final mandate from the courts that allows us to start to consider what the adjustments to the benefits could be. Just for your recollection, at the end of the year, we sat with a total liability of $447 million, and the annual cash and expense charge for that is about $30 million a year. Now, how much of potential benefit we could achieve from the ruling, again, it's too premature for us to speculate on that until we get the final ruling. As far as timing, the current appeal process could be resolved in any wide range of timeframes, anywhere from a couple of weeks to many months, upwards of six to seven months, depending on how the appeals court wants to proceed with an appeal from the UAW. And we'll obviously keep people updated as the issues transpire out of the courts. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And that $447 million, is that everything \u2013 does that include different sub-segments of retirees or is the $447 million all the UAW related that's under (28:23)? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Of the $447 million, about 95% or maybe about $430 million is U.S.-related. And I'd say the bulk of that, almost the entirety of that is really related to UAW. Now, the portion of that that's subject to the actual litigation itself is less than half of that number at the moment. We're hopeful that once the court resolves the issues and hopefully rules in our favor that it will give us the opportunity to reassess all of those retiree healthcare benefits in the U.S. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Very helpful. And then in terms of the commodity exposure, can you remind us if you have any hedging or indexing mechanism that you get some of those $25 million, $30 million back? I mean, do you get recovery on that eventually or is it on a lag? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: We do. It's on a lag in terms of our recovery from customers. So, as we're seeing an increase right now in steel prices, that increase is starting to come through from the supply base to us. And then we have pass-through mechanisms with our OE customers around the globe that allow us to pass those back to them, generally on about a six month or so lag. So, some of the potential offset to that, we won't see in the current fiscal year. It will slide into next year. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And are all your contracts under pass-through? Any percent that protects that or... Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I mean, the overwhelming bulk of our OE contracts and relationships are governed in practice by contract with these recovery mechanisms, so yes. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. And then lastly, the one-time, the $10 million legal charge in the quarter, why is that not sort of pulled out as a onetime charge? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Well, consistent with some of our recent practice, we've been absorbing the positives and minuses in our P&L. So, even last year, just two quarters ago, we had a $10 million favorable legal litigation settlement related to asbestos, for instance, and we didn't adjust that out. And so, as we look at it, in terms of maintaining consistency with recent practice, what we saw even in the last year, we thought it appropriate to just keep that in the baseline results and just absorb it and outperform and hit our results even with that headwind. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. A few follow-up questions. First, with the litigation, since the Sixth Circuit has already ruled, are you talking about either a potential en banc appeal or requesting that it go back to the Supreme Court? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think the first step, Brian, is an en banc appeal. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: We should (31:05) to UAW's intention here most likely before the end of the week. But they're asking for an en banc appeal, but that's the first step in the process. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question, there certainly been some tweets out of Tesla on all-electric semi trucks, as well as your partner Volvo AB is piloting some hybrid electric long-haul trucks. Setting aside the debate on where it makes sense, where it doesn't make sense, but if you just think of the potential Meritor content on a hybrid electric truck and then on a electric truck, maybe differentiated between long-haul and in-town delivery, how would you see that evolving? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, great question, Brian. This area I'm spending quite a bit of time on having our electrification team, in fact, is reported directly to me. And so, I think on the Class 8 linehaul, what we're seeing is much of the industry is looking at solutions that are prior to the drive axle, probably with the exception of Nikola and Tesla, which are looking at wheel-end applications. Where there is wheel-end applications, we've been deeply involved in many of those, as you know, with Nikola in developing independent suspension solutions really out of our military applications derived from those applications to help them with those designs. Where it is prior to the drive axle, so many of them are a series or parallel hybrid applications coming through the transmission and replacing that transmission. It still uses a traditional drive axle, but in fact, as you may recall a number of years ago, we've been updating this product ever since. We had a series in parallel hybrid solution that Walmart was running on a Navistar vehicle. So, a lot of the OEs are looking to us for some design expertise there as well. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just maybe \u2013 you mentioned military, and I know you always discuss this at the annual meeting. We certainly have a new administration, not much happened to defense budget in the continuing resolution. But just where do you think discussions are vis-\u00e0-vis the various land vehicle programs that you are involved with, could be involved with, could be accelerated, and how do you see that shaping up? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think the timing is still unclear. But obviously, the next one appears to be on the road map is the recapitalization of the FMTV fleet, which we are involved with some customers on and looking at providing certain products and either varying levels of content. And then we expect shortly after that the HMMWV recap will be revisited, which we, again, have potential for significant content. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the update on the Sixth Circuit decision. Most of my questions there have been answered. But I thought to ask what your understanding or your council's understanding is of the likelihood of success on the UAW's part in the appeals process. I think it's quite low, but I thought to ask. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Very difficult for us to speculate on that. I think we obviously asked that question, and as a client of our firm, we've remained \u2013 for our legal firm we've remained bullish on that but very difficult for us to speculate. As you know, this is a highly politicized issue. So, I think there are a lot of puts and takes in the courts that we can't always control. So, we'll just have to wait and see and continue to perform on our current plan and just hope that the ruling is upheld. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just a question on the outlook. It looks like you're raising your guidance for most items although FCF didn't tick up. I was just curious what the puts and takes are there this year relative to... Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Is this on (35:32) cash flow, Ryan? Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Yeah. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think the primary issue is like how we dealt with the last upturn in North America that we experienced, we preemptively built inventory banks (35:42) to make certain that we responded to (35:46) uptakes and order demand. And so, we've taken that same strategic approach this time because we think it builds enormous long-term franchise value for Meritor in the last upturn. And so, we are beginning to build some targeted strategic inventory bank (36:07) so that's why we're not expecting the cash flow performance to near term mirror the uptick in earnings and revenue. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then just lastly from me, there was that earlier question about the electrification of commercial vehicle drivetrains. You've talked before about the 14X HE (36:24) axle which has the potential to improve the payback period of truck and bus hybrid systems. How far along in development would you say that this product is, this axle is? And then are you coming to the point now where you can begin to quote it out to commercial vehicle manufacturers and whether or not you are that far along? Are you able to sort of gauge initial customer interest? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, we're having many meetings with potential customers and integrators. In fact, earlier this week, I was out in Silicon Valley meeting with a few electrification integrators who were very interested in the product because of the packaging it allows the vehicle manufacturers to put more battery capacity compared to some of the current designs that they're looking at deploying. We will have a prototype at the NACV Show here in September, and we are in preliminary discussions, I would say, with most of our OE customers and some new partners about potentially launching that axle. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very interesting. Thank you. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. You called out in your press release that increasing your share of the aftermarket is one of your strategies. Could you just sort of explain how you expect to do that at a high level? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. What we've done is we've looked for categories where we believe we have a stronger right to play, for example, some gearing and drivetrain categories, for example, and looked at filling out our portfolio in those areas and launching new products and also looking at improving our delivery and distribution network. So, we're evaluating whether we \u2013 and are beginning to launch the execution of some new warehouse and delivery sites so we can shorten the speed to market in terms of delivery of product. We also, as I mentioned on the call, updated our website and our online capabilities to be much more user friendly. And as I mentioned on the call, we're starting to see these very focused efforts begin to generate revenue in line with our M2019 objectives. Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. And I also wanted to ask you, if you had thoughts on the trajectory of the OEMs, production rates, as we go throughout the calendar year. Do you expect the second half to tail off at all or just sort of accelerate from the second quarter? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I think we're expecting \u2013 I mean, what we're seeing right now is production levels in the current quarter are ramping up, and we're expecting to see that through at least the balance of our fiscal year. So, we're seeing a strong uptick here in the third quarter that we're now sitting in. Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. And just wanted to ask you one on China, I know it's not too big of a part of your revenue business, but there is some conflicting things we've heard from other companies here. And do you think the sort of surging activity sort of early this year was more of a first or second quarter event and do you think it's sustainable through the end of the year? (39:52) Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, frankly, I think it's been sustained longer than our initial expectation, so we're seeing the housing construction market remain strong, for example, which is driving XCMG's revenues and also pulling demand on our axle products. What we're also very encouraged long term is that the market seems to be moving up to that mid-tier more rapidly than we may have expected on the on-highway products, which is, if you recall, in our M2019 strategy, is a significant component bringing our on-highway drive axles to that market. So, we're also very encouraged with the long-term prospects in that market for us. Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that ends our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer, for closing remarks. Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Heather. This does conclude our second quarter earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. And again, we thank you for your participation. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you all may disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

In addition, we are always happy to host investors at any of our facilities. Please contact me directly to schedule a visit. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay. Jay Craig : Thanks, Carl. And good morning, everyone. On Slide 3, you\u2019ll see this was another excellent quarter for Meritor. Sales were $920 million, up 9% from the same quarter last year. This increase is due primarily to the stronger Class 8 market in North America as well as higher production in Europe and China and the continued positive benefit of new business wins. Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million this quarter, the highest the company has reported in over the past 7 years, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2%. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.64, and free cash flow increased to $94 million. Higher-than-anticipated volumes in most of our end markets and continued operational performance across the company are improving our outlook for the full fiscal year. In past quarters, our margin performance was strong despite the revenue challenges associated with weaker end markets. Now that we\u2019re seeing higher volumes come through in North America, Europe, China and even South America, our results are reflecting that benefit as we successfully convert on the incremental revenue. So as a consequence, we are raising our outlook again for the full year; and are particularly pleased to announce that we are taking our revenue guidance up by $150 million, with about 1/4 of that being driven by market outperformance. We\u2019re driving increases in share beyond our prior expectations with key customers around the globe, particularly in North America, Europe and India. And we\u2019re delivering new business wins as part of our M2019 program that are starting to come into the P&L this year. Take a look at Slide 4. We remain confident in our ability to meet the financial objectives we set for M2019. We are increasing our market share with key customers, renewing long-term contracts and winning new business in all regions around the globe across both of our operating segments. In addition to the wins we outlined for you on our last call, we continue to execute on new revenue opportunities that should contribute another $45 million of revenue outperformance in 2019. As we said in the past, these wins vary in size but are all important and are beginning to flow through our financials this year. With regard to contract renewals, we\u2019ve recently finalized agreements with IVECO to continue supplying axles for its trucks in Europe. We also announced a new three year agreement with the REV Group. Under this agreement, REV will continue to equip its bus, fire and specialty vehicles with Meritor\u2019s fully dressed axle assemblies. In addition to our current product offering, we\u2019re looking forward to working with these customers on new products and the development of future designs. This is consistent with the strategy we\u2019ve talked about now for a few years, which is to ensure we stay closely aligned with our customers in the development of new technology and forward product programs. We also continue to look at opportunities to invest in future products and technologies like the electric drive train solutions we told you about a couple quarters ago and which we will profile at the upcoming NACV Show in September. On Slide 5, you can see four important recognitions we received this quarter from Daimler, Ashok Leyland, PACCAR and Hino. You\u2019ll also remember that, last quarter, we received the Diamond Supplier Award from Navistar and the excellent supplier award from XCMG. Our global team is working hard to provide all of our customers with excellent quality and on-time delivery. This has been and will remain our top priority for us. We know that being a reliable partner in an industry with such rapid demand changes is absolutely critical. If you turn to Slide 6, I will give you some color on the changes we see in our end markets. We meaningfully increased our production outlook since the last quarter for Class 8 trucks in North America from a midpoint of 210,000 units to approximately 230,000. While longer-term indicators remained mixed, we are seeing strong production right now in our facilities. As a result, we do expect the second half of fiscal 2017 to be stronger than the first. In terms of Class 8 builds, we were encouraged to see the largest quarter-over-quarter increase in recent history occur from the second fiscal quarter to the third, a 29% increase or close to 15,000 units. Meritor delivered exceptionally well during this demand cycle in which we experienced not only higher market volumes but also increased share in certain product lines. Excellent execution in all cycles is now a distinguishing characteristic of this company and one that our customers consider when selecting strategic partners. We tightened our range for medium duty this quarter, with the midpoint remaining the same from last quarter at 240,000 units, essentially flat to last fiscal year. In Western Europe, we slightly increased our midpoint for medium- and heavy-duty production. The economic outlook in the region remains as strong as it has been in six years, with growth expected at 3% this year. Heavy truck registrations were up more than 13% in May year-over-year, contributing to a stable upward trend. We increased our revenue forecast in China approximately $25 million for the year. This is primarily driven by increased activity in the construction segment and new products that we\u2019ve launched in the region. China continues to be important for us -- as we believe our opportunities for growth in this market as we look ahead to 2019 and beyond. We are now offering a broad range of axle and brake solutions for truck, bus and coach applications that are specifically designed for the Asia Pacific market with localized manufacturing that provides optimized cost savings for our customers. In India, we lowered our production range for the year as third quarter production dipped below previous expectations. This was due to a decrease in heavy truck registrations related to the introduction of emission regulations that took effect on April 1. We still see strong demand, however, with GDP expected in the low 7% range this year and next. And with the growth we\u2019re seeing with our largest customer in the region, our revenue is actually expected to be up year-over-year. Finally, we are maintaining our forecasts for South America, 60,000 to 70,000 units. No real change from last quarter, but as we\u2019ve said, this remains an important market for us. And we\u2019re encouraged with some signs of recovery, albeit as -- at a very slow rate. Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I wanted to give you an update on the OPEB litigation, as there were a few developments this quarter, which are shown on Slide 7.  In April, the Sixth Circuit court of appeals ruled in our favor and subsequently issued a mandate returning the case to the district court for any further proceedings necessary to carry out the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment. At this point, we are waiting for the injunction to be lifted but cannot make any changes to retiree health care benefits until that time. So as I said last quarter, it\u2019s premature to speculate on the outcome, but we\u2019ll keep you posted. Overall, this was a great quarter for us. And as I said earlier, we remain on track, with the entire Meritor team aligned around achieving our M2019 objectives. We are particularly pleased to be in a position to significantly raise our full year guidance for the second quarter in a row. And we remain committed to sustaining the strong performance we\u2019ve delivered throughout the year. With that, I\u2019ll let Kevin give you more detail on the financials, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning. As you just heard from Jay, we had an excellent quarter across the board. We expanded bottom line earnings by 17%, generated significant free cash flow and continue to make good progress toward our M2019 targets. Let\u2019s walk through the details by first turning to Slide 8, where you\u2019ll see our third quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $920 million in the quarter, an increase of 9%. Roughly half of the higher revenue within North America, as we experienced higher Class 8 truck production. Our new business wins continued to come into the P&L, and our market share increased in certain product categories. We also had higher revenue in Europe and China as both of those markets continued to trend positively. As you can see in the line item volume, mix, performance and other, we had $22 million of higher adjusted EBITDA related to $81 million of revenue increase. We continue to see the benefits of our M2016 operational improvements, which are driving strong earnings conversion on incremental revenue. Also included in this line item are $6 million of higher net steel costs on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by $5 million of higher joint venture earnings resulting from the improvement in the North American market. Next you\u2019ll see that we had a $6 million favorable supplier litigation settlement in the third quarter of 2016 that did not repeat this year. You\u2019ll recall that this was an important contributor to last year\u2019s margin exceeding 11%. Moving down the causal, you can see that SG&A was an $8 million increase this quarter, excluding the impact of the supplier settlement in the previous year. This can be explained entirely by an increase in variable compensation expense to catch up our accruals through nine months given that this year\u2019s financial performance is now outpacing our annual plan. These items provide the walk from an adjusted EBITDA of $96 million a year ago to $103 million this year and to our reported 11.2% adjusted EBITDA margin. This resulted in adjusted income from continuing operations of $60 million or $0.64 per share, which is an increase of $0.07 per share from last year. Slide 9 details third quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $728 million, up 14% from last year. In our two largest markets North America and Europe, truck production was up 5% and 3%, respectively, but as you\u2019ll see, we\u2019re outperforming this end market growth because we\u2019re realizing the benefit from our new business wins and we\u2019re seeing higher market share in certain of our product categories. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $75 million, up $14 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Industrial came in at 10.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from a year ago. This margin improvement was driven by conversion on the higher revenue and continued material performance. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $228 million, up just $1 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, down $12 million compared to last year. As a result, segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 11.4% compared to 16.7% in the same period last year. The decrease in margin performance was primarily driven by the supplier litigation settlement we had a year ago. In addition, we had $4 million of higher allocated variable compensation accruals as well as higher steel costs that impacted the current quarter. Adjusting for the higher-than-normal incentive compensation accruals, our margin performance came in at just over 13% this quarter. Our margin expectations for this operating segment continue to be in the 14% to 15% range as we go forward. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was $94 million, an $8 million improvement over last year. The increase is being driven by our stronger year-over-year earnings. That speaks to the quality of the earnings we\u2019re generating. Earnings are translating to cash flow. Overall, for the first nine months of the year, we have generated $84 million of free cash flow, a $6 million increase over the same period last year. Next I\u2019ll review our fiscal year 2017 outlook on Slide 11. As Jay told you, we are raising our fiscal year 2017 revenue, earnings and free cash flow guidance. Building on our performance in the third quarter, combined with stronger market expectations and continued success in driving our business wins into the P&L, we now expect revenue to be approximately $3.25 billion for fiscal year 2017. This is an increase of $150 million from our previous guidance. From an earnings perspective, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin expectation to approximately 10.2%, up 20 basis points from our previous outlook. We are also increasing adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.30 to approximately $1.70. The combination of higher revenue and increased margin is driving this increase in adjusted EPS. And finally, based on these higher earnings expectations, we are also raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $80 million to $90 million, up from our previous range of $50 million to $70 million. Overall, we are very pleased with our results this quarter and over the first 9 months of our fiscal year. Our continued strong performance, coupled with improving revenue expectations, has provided us the ability to significantly take up our guidance expectations for 2017. Now we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from [GP Mobile]. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : This is Samik on behalf of Ryan Brinkman from JP Morgan. The first question I had is on the commercial truck segment. Your revenues there rose 14% year-on-year in the quarter, so I was wondering if you could break out -- also, the end of market that I look at, like Class 8 and Class 5-7 were up mid-single here, so if you could break out for us : How much of the growth was driven by the industry? And how much will you attribute to sort of market share gains in that growth? Kevin Nowlan : I think, big picture, you can see -- I mean, when you look at the 2 big markets we have in commercial truck, North America and Europe, they were up 3% and 5% roughly. And so the way to think about it is the bulk of the rest was coming from our business outperformance. That\u2019s new business wins. It\u2019s product penetration increases, expansion of share with customers. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of probably strength here in terms of also the raising the revenue guide. You\u2019re raising the revenue guide on the end market strength. How should we think about the sustainability of the end market strength going into 2018? Like, what\u2019s your outlook in terms of how sustainable these end market strengths are going into the next year? Jay Craig : Ryan, this is Jay. I think the way we\u2019re thinking about it is, right now even with that increase in market expectations, for the full year, we\u2019re -- or our fiscal year, we\u2019re starting to push towards replacement demand. And I think, as we look longer term at the U.S. economy and its health, we see no reason that the Class 8 market shouldn\u2019t be able to sustain that replacement demand level going forward. Obviously, we\u2019re not giving our guidance yet for 2018, but I think, as we look at the market fundamentally, we just think with a healthy economy that replacement demand expectation should be reasonable. Samik Chatterjee : Got it, got it. And then just a last question. How should we think about sort of a typical incremental margin for the last quarter of the year? Because if I sort of look at what your guidance is implying in terms of revenue growth, which is sort of a $100 million increase; and put a 15% incremental margin on it, which you seem to have done this quarter as well, excluding the sort of backout of the benefit you had last quarter from the supplier payment, the math then sort of indicate that you could sort of outperform the 10.2% margin guidance you\u2019re sort of issuing today for the year. So can you just help me in terms of is there anything that could depress incrementals in the last quarter? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think, as you think about sequentially going from Q3 to Q4, the first thing I\u2019d say is that supplier litigation settlement isn\u2019t relevant to this year. That was a last year good news item. So that\u2019s not embedded in our Q3 2017 guidance or results. As you think about what\u2019s implied in our guidance for Q4, our expectation is that revenue from Q3 to Q4 drops by about $95 million, and that\u2019s predominantly driven by the fact that we have the European shutdown, which always brings our revenue down sequentially from Q3 to Q4. We\u2019ll also see some seasonal -- we\u2019re coming off our seasonal peaks in our aftermarket and China businesses as well, so we tend to see a little bit of pullback in revenue in the fourth quarter there as well. But all told, it\u2019s about $95 million of revenue step down sequentially. And we\u2019re assuming, if you cut through the guidance, about a 20% conversion on that roughly $20 million of EBITDA lower. That\u2019s what\u2019s implied in our Q4 guidance. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open. Brian Johnson : Yes. You seem to have stronger end markets and new business wins, but you lowered your CapEx guidance. Is that timing of investments? Is that going to be added to next year\u2019s CapEx? Or just how, given the growth, should we be thinking about that? Jay Craig : Yes, yes, Brian, this is Jay. I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s really a timing issue. A lot of our projects are quite large. And although we\u2019re encouraging the team to continue to invest, to achieve as much labor and burden and material cost savings as they can, it\u2019s just a question of timing. And I think the run rate that you\u2019ve seen us at the last couple years is what we think a go-forward picture looks like. Brian Johnson : Okay. Can you help us refine in terms of bucketing or breaking down, obviously in the Commercial Truck & Industrial sector, just the growth between what was end market growth, what was market share wins, what was new business? And then were there some things either in industrial or military that kind of came through that we haven\u2019t seen in prior quarters? Jay Craig : I think we\u2019ll be bucketing that at the end of the year and then at our Investor Day as we scorecard ourselves against our M2019 targets. So we\u2019ll give you more detail at that time. As I spoke to in our initial comments, of the revenue guidance increase, roughly 25% of that was due to new business wins. And another data point that we called out was, even though the India market is down, we expect to be up because of the market share gains with primarily our largest customer but across the market. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel from Stifel. Your line is open. Mike Baudendistel : I think that\u2019s me. Anyway, in the REV Group deal, I just wanted to ask you. They do so many different product types, I mean. Is that really -- are you doing business with them throughout their sort of products portfolio? Or is it sort of concentrated in certain types of products that they\u2019re manufacturing? Jay Craig : No. Great question, Mike. In fact, that\u2019s what makes us most excited about that announcement is, prior to this, we really didn\u2019t have a single overarching agreement with the REV Group, so the opportunities were with each of the individual brands. This is the first consolidated agreement we\u2019ve had with that group. So I think on both sides of the table we have expectations of increasing penetration with them as we become much more closely aligned with the engineering teams in the entire group. Mike Baudendistel : Great. Can you give us a sense of how much revenue that they represents initially? I realize it\u2019s going to ramp up overtime. Jay Craig : Again, we\u2019ll be scorecarding all the M2019 wins at the end of the year. And as we start to look at the opportunities individually, we\u2019ll certainly highlight the larger ones individually, when we come through at the end of the year. But again, we\u2019re very pleased with just being right on track with where we expected to be and wanted to be on that revenue growth program overall. Mike Baudendistel : Great. And I also wanted to ask you IVECO. You said that it was a continuation of an existing relationship with them. I mean, was it any larger than the prior relationship in terms of what you\u2019re supplying to them? Jay Craig : No, it was a predual long-term agreement. We provide IVECO in Europe all their single-reduction drive axle needs that they require in Europe. But again, every major customer agreement that are long term is very critical to us and took an enormous effort by the -- by our team to make sure we execute it successfully. Mike Baudendistel : Okay, great. And then sticking with Europe, can you just remind us if there\u2019s market share changes within the OEMs in Europe? Are there more of the -- some certain ones that you\u2019re more exposed to there and certain that are ones that are more of [Indiscernible]? Jay Craig : Well, the big customers we\u2019re exposed to are Volvo, Werner and IVECO. And then we\u2019ve won recently the Scania disc brake business, a large share of that, so you can look at Scania. And we have another win that we alluded to last quarter of another European OE that we\u2019ll talk about in more detail in the future. Mike Baudendistel : It sounds good. And also just wanted to ask you quickly : I mean you hired a Chief Strategy Officer in the quarter. I mean, should we think of that person as primarily being someone that prospects for acquisitions, or just looks at corporate strategy overall? Or just any detail there would be great. Jay Craig : Sure. The reason for that hire. We\u2019re thrilled to have Cheri in our team. Cheri is someone we\u2019ve worked with quite extensively before from the Boston Consulting Group, so we are excited to have her join us. It was primarily to support us in all our growth initiatives, both organic and through bolt-on acquisitions that we\u2019re looking at. Obviously, a large part of our M2019, in fact, has come from revenue growth, and we want to make sure we go about that in the most thoughtful and organized way. And we have a lot of good opportunities that we needed to make sure we were sorting through properly. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Brett Hoselton : It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re prepared to talk about your revenue target specifically or where you\u2019re at. And I\u2019m wondering what your -- what is your confidence level at achieving that 2019 revenue target? Jay Craig : It\u2019s stated, Brett. We\u2019re -- so far, what we disclosed last quarter and this quarter, we\u2019re at $115 million towards that target of $450 million. I think we are very confident in our ability to achieve that target. I think we\u2019re right on the flight path we expected to be. We -- as you would expect, we have detailed meetings with all the operating teams, going through their risk-adjusted pipelines. And what I\u2019m most pleased about is the overarching strategy of becoming closer to the marketplace and our major customers. And then having significant additional new product launches is really getting a lot of traction, and you can see that in this quarter\u2019s results. And we\u2019re also looking at some interesting bolt-on acquisition opportunities, and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll have some of those consummated in the not-too-distant future. Brett Hoselton : And switching gears, can you talk a little bit about what are you seeing? You talked about near term the European market, commercial vehicle market; and the South American market. Can you kind of speak to those markets in terms of your outlook into 2018? Do you see strengths continuing in Europe? And where do you see South America? Jay Craig : I think it\u2019s premature for us to give 2018 guidance, but if I look at each market individually, I think Europe is keeping up with replacement demand. We\u2019re finally just moving along in a replacement demand market, which is excellent for us particularly with our market share gains. And so it -- what\u2019s encouraging to us about that market for the future? There\u2019s not a pull-ahead of an emissions or safety required change. So with -- and GDP is healthy in Europe and moving along. And South America, it\u2019s stable, as we\u2019d said. They really need political stability there. Any time you see the political environment becomes stable, you start to see a strong pickup in business activity, but then there\u2019s a step back as another issue arises in that arena. So I think the bellwether we look for in that market is just political stability. And we think the underlying business demand will be quite strong. Brett Hoselton : And then finally, from a commodity standpoint, have you seen any particular headwinds, particularly from a steel standpoint? Jay Craig : Steel for the year has been a headwind, but I think we\u2019re starting to see stability recently in that. So obviously I think the company has done an excellent job of dealing with that this year. And if you\u2019ll recall, the majority of our contracts have pass-through mechanisms that have on average a six-month lag in them, so -- but we\u2019ll recover the vast majority of those increases over time. But I think, during this time period where we\u2019ve seen the headwinds in this fiscal year, I\u2019ve just been very, very pleased with how the team has responded in getting additional material cost-downs since quite a while. Kevin Nowlan : And to dimension that numerically, Brett, it\u2019s the quarter year-over-year, it\u2019s about $6 million headwind. And year-to-date, we\u2019re about $21 million headwind, but as we sit here today and look at the full year, we\u2019ll be in about $25 million to $30 million full year headwind, which is really unchanged from what we were thinking a quarter ago. So we\u2019ve seen a little bit more stability in the steel indices in the last few months than what we saw in the early part of the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Just to follow up on that last point on steel. So if steels moderates here, it sounds like, at least for the fourth quarter, a little bit less of a net headwind. And then as we go into \u201818, again if things flatten -- if steel prices flatten out, you would be -- expect to sort of have a little bit of a potential benefit from a recovery. Is that the right way to think about it? Kevin Nowlan : That\u2019s right, because the steel recovery mechanisms will start to kick in at the tail end of this year and really into the beginning of next year for the steel price increases we\u2019ve really seen in the last quarter or 2. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reading too much into this, but look, I noticed you\u2019ve called out steel more in the aftermarket segment, as opposed to commercial vehicle, so is there something -- is that because more of the recoveries are -- contractual recoveries are in that area in the commercial truck segment? Kevin Nowlan : It\u2019s a really good point. The -- as you think about the $6 million headwind we had in the quarter year-over-year, about $3 million of it was in Aftermarket & Trailer. $3 million of it was in commercial truck. And the reason we saw a little bit of a disproportionate hit to the Aftermarket & Trailer business relative to its revenue is because of pass-through mechanisms. Commercial Truck & Industrial, with the OE customers, has the traditional pass-through mechanisms with lag on about a 6-month basis. When you think of aftermarket, the aftermarket business in and of itself doesn\u2019t operate with the same types of pass-through mechanisms. We tend to go out with pricing periodically maybe once a year, it could be more often than that, on a general basis, but the pricing is established, whether it\u2019s up or down, based on a whole set of market dynamics, not just steel. So when we look at a particular quarter that we saw year-over-year we had a steel headwind in the segment but we didn\u2019t have a specific recovery mechanism to offset that in the segment. Joseph Spak : That\u2019s helpful. And then just bigger picture, Haldex, with respect to their deal, they -- there was a release today that talked about some disruption in their business and order book. And I didn\u2019t know if you were sort of seeing any benefit there on air disc brakes. And then it looks like -- I don\u2019t know if that deal goes through, or not. It looks like it might not. I mean, is that something that would be of interest, or at least elements of that business of interest, to Meritor? Jay Craig : Well, Haldex, as far -- we compete in the foundation brake business. And Haldex\u2019 share of that, particularly on the truck side, is fairly de minimis. And the -- so we haven\u2019t seen any significant impacts. They\u2019re more heavily weighted towards the trailer foundation brake side, which we\u2019d certainly have meaningful share in North America but not so much in Europe. So I think I haven\u2019t seen any near-term impact. As far as M&A opportunity, we don\u2019t comment on specific opportunities, and so we will just hold off on any further comments on that. Joseph Spak : Fair enough. And then last one, on the OPEB update. I mean, is it fair -- so it seems like the appeal could go through September, so in terms of thinking -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing work internally, but in terms of thinking about an updated communication to the Street sometime around then, is that a fair thinking? Jay Craig : Well, I -- obviously, our next quarterly call will be in early November. And so we\u2019ll, at the latest, have an update at that point. We did file a motion with the district court in the -- on the 19th of July and have had a hearing scheduled for late August. If there is a ruling from the bench at that hearing, we\u2019ll update the market at that point in time, but we remain optimistic that this will get resolved over the coming months. And when it does and once we\u2019ve communicated to the company and any impacted retirees, we\u2019ll then update the market. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Carl Anderson : Thank you, Danielle. This does conclude our Third Quarter Earnings Call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you for your participation. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin. Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the expressed written consent of Meritor. We considered your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 3 for a look at the quarter. Kevin will take you through the full-year analysis later in the presentation. Our revenue in the quarter was $922 million, up 27% from the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher production in all regions and the traction we're getting with new business wins. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $98 million compared to $74 million in the same period last year. Margin in the fourth quarter was $10.6%, an increase of 40 basis points. While we've had good margin performance in past quarters, our margin this quarter reflects the benefit of the higher volumes and our continued excellent operational performance. The majority of the margin improvement was driven by conversion in our Commercial Truck & Industrial business where our margin expanded 280 basis points to 10%. We converted around 18% on incremental sales of $187 million in this business, with tremendous delivery and quality performance across the board. You may remember that we also demonstrated near-perfect execution in the strong markets of 2015. This speaks to the sustained level of operational excellence that has now become a competitive differentiator for Meritor. Adjusted income from continuing operations in the quarter was $56 million for the total company or $0.62 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, nearly double from the same period last year. Across the company, we have put a tremendous effort into ensuring that we deliver sustained improvement in our financial results, and we take pride in the fact that we are consistently meeting or exceeding our commitments to shareholders. We intend to continue that trend. Let's go to slide 4 for a brief update on progress towards our M2019 objectives. We will provide more detail at our upcoming analyst event in New York in December. As you know, our three M2019 financial targets are : to grow revenue by 20% above the market; increase EPS by $1.25 or 80% to $2.84, and achieve a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 1.5 times. As we scorecard ourselves against those targets, here is where we are, keeping in mind that our jump-off point was the end of fiscal year 2015, so we are now halfway through the M2019 cycle. We have earned more than 6% towards our revenue target of 20% outperformance. And if you look at what we've won in total, we are really more than 14% toward our goal, but still have work to do to get all of those wins fully into the P&L. We remain confident in reaching 20% outperformance and will provide more visibility on those opportunities in December. In terms of improving profit, we've earned $0.29 toward our objective of increasing EPS by $1.25 on our path towards $2.84. In addition to our strong performance contributing to this metric, we amended certain retiree medical benefits in the fourth quarter that we expect will reduce this expense by approximately $39 million annually. That should provide a tailwind to our EPS as we look ahead. For capital allocation, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times. However, on a pro forma basis, for the Meritor WABCO divestiture, we are at 2.1 times. With two years left in the plan, we believe we are on track to achieve all three objectives. In fiscal year 2017, we took the opportunity to initiate and complete several strategic actions, all of which we believe will contribute to success of M2019. I'll talk more about those in a few moments. Additional highlights from the year that position us as a market leader include receiving Navistar's Diamond Supplier Award, Ashok Leyland's first ever Gold Delivery Award, and excellent supplier recognition from XCMG and eight quality awards from major customers, six of which were from Daimler. We also developed electric drive axles and suspensions that we believe will position us as a leader in electric solutions for the commercial vehicle market; launched a new value brand called Mach that features all-makes products engineered to industry standards at affordable prices for our aftermarket customers; established a West Coast aftermarket distribution center in California that will enable us to fulfill aftermarket orders to customers in 24 hours or less; and achieved a safety rate of 0.48 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. Our target for M2019 is to achieve a rate of less than 0.65, which we beat this year. The safety of Meritor employees are top priority. And even though we believe this incident rate positions us among the best industrial companies in the world, we will continue to work with our employees toward even further improvement. On slide 5, you'll see eight products we've launched in fiscal 2017. This year's launch cycle included axles for truck and trailers, front and rear, medium and heavy, and on and off highway vehicles. We believe this aggressive launch cycle ensures we can offer our customers the broadest and deepest range of products in the industry. Meritor's robust product portfolio is a key element to winning incremental business and growing our top line at the pace we have committed to under M2019. Slide 6 represents some of the new business we were awarded in fiscal year 2017 with major truck, trailer, bus and coach, specialty and defense customers in several major regions of the world. We earned new axle business with Volvo Thailand and Volvo Eicher, as well as a new contract from Tata's Ultra trucks. We're now supplying JAC Motors and Qingling with our dual light family of products in China. We developed a tandem axle with hub reduction for a major customer outside of North America that will be used on a new series of construction vehicles. We have a new axle contract with Kenworth for our heavy haul customer in the Middle East and with Navistar Defense for its MaxxPro recovery vehicle program, as well as a contract to supply transfer cases for the new GM and Navistar Class 4 and 5 medium-duty truck. We also have standard axle position with Heil Trailer on its chemical trailer line. As important as these new business wins are to us, we recognize the importance of maintaining and growing the relationships we have with our long-term strategic customers, all of whom we continue to collaborate with on new opportunities for today and tomorrow. In that regard, we're excited to announce that we have extended our long-term European axle contract with Volvo through 2024. During the term of this contract, we will perform a technical upgrade to our axle offering that incorporates higher efficiency and higher gross combination weight capabilities. On slide 7, you'll see more detail on our acquisition of the product portfolio and related technologies Fabco Holdings and its subsidiaries. With this suite of products, particularly the addition of transfer cases and gearboxes, we now have an expanded portfolio of complementary products for medium, heavy and extra-heavy vehicles for on and off-highway, construction, defense, rail, and other industrial applications for both OE and aftermarket customers. This transaction allows us to offer global customers a wider breadth of capabilities and will help us diversify and expand into the rail and oil and gas industries. We expect this transaction to generate approximately $50 million of incremental revenue in fiscal year 2019. Let's turn to slide 8. Also in fiscal year 2017, we closed the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO joint venture for a total purchase price of $250 million, and also received the final partner earnings distribution of $8 million just prior to closing. We believe this transaction allows us to further sharpen our focus on the strategic priorities of M2019 and beyond. We will also remain the exclusive distributor of certain WABCO aftermarket products in the United States and Canada and a distributor in Mexico through an aftermarket distribution agreement. Either party can terminate these distribution arrangements at certain points during the first three and a half years at an exercise price between $225 million and $265 million based on the earnings of the business. In the end, we believe this was a good transaction for the company and our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on our financials. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our full-year financial results and then I'll provide you with an initial look at our 2018 guidance. Overall, we had an excellent year of financial performance as we expanded adjusted EPS by 15%, drove revenue growth of approximately 5% and generated $81 million of free cash flow. We also significantly improved the balance sheet as we reduced our total debt and retirement liabilities by more than $600 million. As a result, we now have positive book equity for the first time since 2008. With this strong performance and improved capital structure, we are well-positioned to deliver on M2019 financial commitments and to continue driving value for our shareholders. Let's turn to slide 9 where you'll see our full-year financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were up $148 million from last year on higher production in Europe, China and South America. But more importantly, we increased revenue from new business wins coming online. These factors more than offset the 6% decline in Class A truck production in North America during the fiscal year. We expanded gross margin by 90 basis points as we converted on incremental revenue while also continuing to achieve strong material, labor, and burden performance that more than offset the impact of higher net steel costs. You can really see the impact of this performance in the line item Volume, Mix, Performance & Other on the right side of the chart, as we have $59 million of higher adjusted EBITDA on $139 million of higher revenue. Embedded within this line item is approximately $26 million of steel headwind so you can get an idea of the strength of our conversion and operating performance. As we have discussed during the last couple of quarters, we did have a $16 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from two discrete items. First, we had a one-time unfavorable $10 million settlement with our joint venture partner in Mexico in 2017 related to disputes between the parties. And in 2016, we had a favorable supplier litigation settlement of $6 million that did not repeat. Next, you'll see the foreign exchange with a slight tailwind to revenue in 2017. The EBITDA impact from foreign exchange was a $12 million benefit on a year-over-year basis. This favorability was primarily driven by hedged mark-to-market gains this year and a corresponding hedge loss a year ago. All of these transactions were executed as part of our hedging program to mitigate the risk from currently fluctuations. Moving down the (15:18), you can see that SG&A, excluding the various litigation settlements, increased by $35 million this year. Due to strong financial performance in 2017, our variable compensation expense was $21 million higher than in 2016. In addition, we have $15 million in higher asbestos expense this year. This was driven by the favorable insurance settlements related to asbestos we executed in 2016 which did not repeat. These were the two main drivers of our higher SG&A expense in 2017. As we look ahead to 2018, we do expect to see more normalized incentive compensation accruals. However, we are starting to strategically add head count and other investment in support of our M2019 revenue growth initiatives. So, while you will see a step-down in SG&A for incentive compensation, it will be partially offset by this increased investment going forward. These items provide the walk from an adjusted EBITDA of $327 million a year ago to $347 million this year, which resulted in our reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4%. This also allowed us to drive adjusted income from continuing operations of $170 million or $1.88 per share, which is an increase of $0.24 per share from last year. We did see a relatively low effective tax rate of 5% in 2017 due to several favorable tax items in the year. That rate is lower than what you should expect going forward. Slide 10 details full-year sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales for full-year 2017 were just over $2.6 billion, up 7% from last year, driven by nearly $100 million in new business wins that were in the P&L as well as stronger end markets. Europe and Brazil truck production levels are up approximately 5% and 20%, respectively. While in China, our revenue increased by more than $40 million due to a stronger off-highway market. In India, we expanded revenue by $30 million even as truck production was down 9% in the fiscal year. During the year, we benefited from one of our largest customers gaining market share, and we increased our share with that customer as well. Finally, in North America, Class A truck production declined 6%, but our revenue was roughly flat due to the impact of our new business wins. Segment-adjusted EBITDA was $244 million, up $36 million or 17% from last year. Segment-adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Industrial came in at 9.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from a year ago. The margin improvement was driven by conversion on the higher revenue and continued material, labor and burden performance, partially offset by higher net steel costs and higher variable compensation accruals. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $853 million, down $7 million from last year. Our aftermarket business was up slightly in 2017. However, this was more than offset by lower production in the trailer market. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $106 million, down $9 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 12.4% compared to 13.4% in the same period a year ago. The decrease in margin was driven by the $6 million prior-year supplier litigation recovery I referenced earlier, as well as higher variable compensation accruals. Turning to slide 11, I wanted to provide more detail on a couple of important items we announced in the fourth quarter. In September, we received a favorable court ruling that dissolved the 2006 injunction previously barring the company from making healthcare benefit changes to certain retirees. As a result, we announced our intention to modify these benefits, which was the primary contributor to the $343 million reduction in our OPEB liability at year-end. We expect our retiree medical expense to improve by $39 million going forward from $24 million of expense to $15 million of income in 2018. Additionally, we expect to see a $13 million reduction in corresponding cash payments in 2018. On the right side of the chart, I wanted to highlight the convertible debt transactions we executed. We funded the repurchase of $236 million of convertible notes with a new $325 million convertible note issuance and with $93 million of cash on hand. The new security was issued with a 3.25% coupon and a 60% conversion premium, which pegged the conversion price at nearly $40 per share. As a result of these transactions, we were able to lower interest expense by $3 million annually, eliminate more than 5 million shares of dilution at today's stock price, and extend the debt maturity profile such that there are no significant bond maturities until 2024. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2018 market outlook on slide 12. Building on strong fourth quarter production, combined with an improving freight environment, we are planning for higher Class A truck volumes in 2018. As you know, October can be a bellwether month for truck orders, and this year, the orders came in at more than 36,000 trucks. As a result, we are projecting North America Class A production of 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2018, up 10% to 18% from 2017 levels. We also believe the medium-duty market will be between 230,000 to 250,000 units in 2018, similar to last year. As we look overseas, Europe should be relatively stable in 2018 as economic indicators continue to show solid freight fundamentals. Looking to Asia, we expect the market in China to be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis and, in India, we are seeing some moderate growth in our end markets. Finally, our outlook for Brazil is that the market will be up slightly. Market optimism appears to be returning and GDP is expected to be positive for the second year in a row. Based on these demand assumptions, you can see how that translates to our fiscal year 2018 outlook, which is summarized on slide 13. We expect sales to be between $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, up 8% to 11% compared to 2017. Higher class A truck volumes in North America coupled with new business wins are expected to drive a meaningful step up in revenue for us. We are forecasting that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand again in 2018 to a range of 10.8% to 11.0%. There are several components that drive our margin expectations for next year. On the positive side, we expect margin expansion related to the $39 million improvement in retiree medical expense and from normal conversion on higher revenue. Partially offsetting this are the $27 million of lower earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the former Meritor WABCO joint venture as well as the planned increase in SG&A and engineering investment to support our M2019 revenue growth initiatives. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to increase to a range of $2.20 to $2.40, a meaningful step-up from last year. Included in this guidance is our expectation that we will return to a more normalized effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 15%. In part, that's because we are expecting to generate cash tax expense in certain European jurisdictions where we have now fully utilized our net operating loss carry-forwards. And finally, we anticipate generating free cash flow of approximately $90 million to $100 million. This is even after investing another $100 million of CapEx in 2018 in support of our M2019 growth and operational performance initiatives and investing in working capital to support the $250 million to $350 million in revenue growth. Overall, you can see that our 2018 guidance suggests continued improvement in the financial performance of the company as we drive toward achievement of our M2019 targets. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay for closing remarks. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Let's go to slide 14. On December 7, we'll host an Analyst Day event in New York. At that time, we look forward to a more detailed discussions with you about M2019 and our financial outlook. We hope you will be able to join us. Also, before I close, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the excellent work by our global leadership team and the efforts of every Meritor employee over the past year. The alignment and dedication of our 8,200 employees is reflected in the results we shared with you today and the noteworthy transformation of the company over the past several years. So to our employees and to the investment community, Run With The Bull. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : The first question, I guess, is just on the Aftermarket & Trailer business, which kind of gets a little bit less attention. I know you had a tough comp in the quarter with the insurance settlement last year, but I guess what I want to better understand is sort of really for the year, what happens? I think early in the year, you were talking about sort of a 14% target. It obviously came in below. And I guess, more importantly, how we should think about that segment heading into 2018. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yes. Good question, Joe. I mean, we continue to expect that this is a business that will operate north of 14% margin. So that's the start point. Obviously, we came in at only 12.4% for the year. Now, one of the big headwinds that the aftermarket business face is because of the total company performance for the year, we outperformed relative to our incentive compensation plans. So there is about $7 million, $8 million of allocation of variable compensation accrual to that segment which drove the margin down about a point versus what we would normally expect. So as we jump into 2018, we would expect with normalized incentive compensation accruals to already be a point higher than that. The rest of the gap between call it low to mid-13%s and getting to north of 14% where we expect really comes from revenue growth. As part of M2019, we're driving new business wins into that business, as well as many other businesses, and we contribute at a pretty healthy rate in aftermarket because it is a scale business. So we would expect the revenue growth that we're anticipating to ultimately drive us to 14% or more where we expect the business to operate. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And sort of moving on to the overall 2018 outlook and guidance, appreciate some of the color on sort of the puts and takes there. I was sort of trying to follow along. So I guess this is somewhat back of the envelope. But it would seem like the SG&A step-up and increase you talked about for investments would either have to be fairly hefty, or should the incremental margin on the volume, the assumption there is sort of a little bit below sort of what you realized over the past couple of quarters. So I'm assuming it's some conservatism built into the latter or is there something that we're not thinking about on the incremental margin, maybe perhaps steel costs, et cetera. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. It's a couple of things and you've touched on them, and I'll just give a little bit more color. But, keep in mind, we are talking about expanding our margins, again, 40 to 60 basis points year-over-year. So it's a pretty healthy expansion. The two things I would guide you on is, one, as you think about revenue growth, we typically convert 15% to 20% and we've been at the higher end of that range really for the last year. As the markets step up in a pretty aggressive way, particularly here in North America, you can have some inefficiencies in the system that really drives us to the lower end of that range. So as you're modeling the walk from 17% to 18% on revenue, I would model us closer to the 15% than the 20%. So that's point number one. And then second, as it relates to some of these investments, some comes through the SG&A line in the forms of additional head count and other costs we're adding; some comes through the gross margin line in the form of engineering-related expense, both of which are intended to support revenue growth M2019 and beyond M2019. And so those are really the key offsets to may be some of the other math that you're doing that still get us though to 50 basis points plus of margin expansion. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And the higher steel costs or other commodity costs, have you embedded in that incremental margin range you've talked about? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, ultimately, steel is a little bit of tailwind as we go from 2017 to 2018 as long as steel costs moderate. The last quarter, they were up modestly, but as long as they hold flat where they are, steel should be a year-over-year tailwind, but we'll see how steel costs play out for the year. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning, Brett. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning, Brett. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Let's see, a couple of quick questions here. First of all, again, back of the envelope math, if I look at your 2019 target, it seems like you're going to be able to hit your net leverage ratio of 1.5 just by expanding your EBITDA or increasing your EBITDA and maybe a minimal amount of debt paydown. So it seems like a large portion of your free cash flow goes towards share repurchase, am I incorrect in that? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I think a couple of things. As we sit here today, we think we are on the path to hitting 1.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA with the combination of EBITDA growing as well as our cash flow expectations because that impacts net debt. But where we sit today in terms of driving toward our solid to strong BB credit metrics, we don't think there's any additional gross debt paydown that we need to do to accomplish those objectives, which means any of the incremental capital that we're generating over the next couple of years we can use to support our M2019 growth initiatives or longer-term growth initiatives as well as opportunistically buying back shares in the market. And so we'll deploy capital in both ways as we look ahead. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: As I'm looking at kind of like the little subtitle here, return 25% of free cash flow to shareholders, what would the other 75% in your mind go towards? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Well, the other 75%, that's a measure over the four-year period from 2016 to 2019 and some of it goes for debt reduction that's allowed us to hit our net debt-to-EBITDA target and some of it will continue to be invested in the business to support our new business win objectives. As we look at that 25%, I mean, keep in mind, we deployed a lot of capital \u2013 a lot of cash, $93 million in September to execute convertible security repurchases which eliminated 5 million shares of dilution in the marketplace. So it was actually a contributing factor toward helping us allocate capital toward share buybacks effectively. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. I'll swing back around and get back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Neil. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Maybe a follow-up on the margin question. Is the outlook for the lower variable comp in FY 2018 going to fully offset the higher SG&A cost as part of the investment for M2019? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Not completely in the SG&A line. I think the benefit we'll see from the reduced variable compensation accruals will largely offset the increased investment which will come through SG&A and the ER&D or engineering line. But it's not a complete offset, but it's a substantial offset. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then could you provide more granularity on the sales bridge from FY 2017 to FY 2018 cause for (31:50) $300 million increase at the midpoint? Are you able to provide the revenue contribution to the FY 2018 revenue guidance from new business wins that will be realized this year, I guess, both carryover from M2016 and then for the wins from M2019? And then I think you guys called out certainly the higher North America Class 8 production. That probably adds over $100 million at the midpoint. But if you could just talk through any other revenue tailwinds and headwinds that underpin the sales guidance, that would be helpful. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. I mean, I think if you look at it, there's really two big drivers. The first is you touched on the NA truck, the Class 8 truck market, which, if you do the simple math that we guide you to, every 5,000 Class 8 trucks being worth $20 million, that suggests in our guidance a step-up in revenue of between $90 million and $170 million given the range that we're giving of 260,000 to 280,000 Class 8 truck point. As it relates to new business wins, including the Fabco revenue coming into the P&L this year and including M2016 carryover that's coming into the P&L still, we expect that to be north of $160 million going from 2017 to 2018. And then we get a little bit of a tailwind from our India guidance as well, probably another $20 million there. So when you add it all up, that gets you to our range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on that, Kevin. What's the Fabco implied in that $160 million that you called out? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: It's roughly about $35 million. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. At the North America Commercial Vehicle Show during the quarter, we heard a lot about electrification of commercial vehicles from both suppliers and OEMs. I'm curious if you could highlight what you think is the content per vehicle opportunity for Meritor from this trend. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. This is Jay. I think you had the opportunity to visit our booth and see our product offerings there. We displayed three specific offerings. The most significant of which was the e-axle. So we believe if the e-axle is adopted, obviously, the overall content would increase because we're replacing with that single product, the internal combustion engine, the transmission and the existing drivetrain. So we think there are opportunities for additional content. But our main focus is to at this point make certain that we're as represented in the future in the marketplace as we are today in drivetrain. So we'll be talking a lot more about that at the Analyst Day including our different strategies around with it, whichever vehicle architecture is the one that ends up dominating different vehicles certainly in the future. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. I appreciate that. I think later today there's going to be or should be a Tesla Semi truck unveil. I'm just curious how you see \u2013 which vehicles do you think are you targeting that there is the most opportunity? Is it more of that kind of long-haul Class 8 stuff or Class 8 or is it \u2013 which types of electric vehicles do you think that there's the most opportunity for you? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, I think it would be interesting to see Tesla's unveil today. We're excited for them. And, certainly, that segment as I understand what they're addressing which is the day cab segment primarily on their initial launch, has a lot of opportunity. I think when you can push vehicles upwards to 300-mile range, you can do a lot of day cab delivery. Again, our thesis is the most aggressive markets near term to grow will be the medium-duty delivery, the transit bus, and refuse sectors. And so when you look at our different product offerings, those are the markets they're being initially directed toward. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks for the color, and congrats on the quarter. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Carl Anderson for any closing remarks. Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Chelsea. This does conclude Meritor's fourth quarter earnings call. If you do have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cummins Incorporated First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Mark Smith, Vice President, Financial Operations. You may begin. Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2018. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We'll all be available for your questions at the end of our prepared remarks. Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly report on 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and today's materials are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Tom. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2018. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.6 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the first quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $700 million or 12.6% compared to $705 million or 15.4% a year ago. During the first quarter, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $187 million for the expected costs of a product campaign. The charge was shared between the Engine and Components segments. This voluntary campaign is part of a proactive plan to address the performance of an aftertreatment component in certain on-highway products produced between 2010 and 2015 in North America. We disclosed in our third quarter 2017 earnings release that we identified an issue caused by the degradation of performance of this aftertreatment component and that further analysis was required to understand the extent of the problem and the appropriate remedy. The product campaign recorded in the first quarter represents the next step in our process to proactively address this aftertreatment degradation issue. We are working collaboratively with the regulatory agencies and we will need to get agreement from the agencies to finalize our action plans and only then we will know the full cost and timing to resolve the problem. The charge of $187 million reflects our best estimate of the cost of implementing our proposed plan. We have also estimated range of additional costs should the regulatory agencies ask us to replace more aftertreatment hardware than our proposed plan which we believe to be between $0 or $400 million in the worst case. It's important to note that this issue does not affect our current products, which are performing very well, and our market share remains strong. Excluding the charge for the campaign, EBITDA for the first quarter was $887 million, or 15.9%, reflecting an incremental margin of 19%. The strong operating performance in our manufacturing plants, positive pricing and the benefits of material cost reduction initiatives all contributed to the improved performance. Engine business revenues improved by 21% in the first quarter compared to a year ago. Increased production and strong market share in North America truck markets and strong demand from global construction customers, especially in China and North America, drove most of the growth. EBITDA for the quarter was 11.7% compared to 13.5% for the same period in 2017, due to $93 million of costs recorded in the quarter for the product campaign. Excluding the campaign, EBITDA was 15.5% reflecting an incremental margin of 25% year-over-year. Improved pricing, strong performance from our manufacturing plants, and lower operating expenses as a percent of sales, drove the margin expansion. Sales for the Distribution segment grew by 13% year-over-year driven by higher demand for new engines, parts and service in off-highway markets. First quarter EBITDA was 6.6% compared to 7.9% in the first quarter of 2017. EBITDA percent declined due to lower earnings in Africa and the Middle East as a result of weak demand and currency volatility and a lower mix of parts sales in North America. We do expect EBITDA to improve in dollars and as a percent of sales in the second quarter as a result of stronger parts sales, targeted price increases and cost control measures. First quarter revenues for the Components segment rose by 30%. Sales in North America increased 35% and revenues in international markets grew by 25% as a result of rising market demand, strong market share, and the success of new products aimed at lowering emissions. Sales of the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission business contributed 9% to segment growth. EBITDA for the first quarter was 12.9% compared to 16.1% in the same quarter a year ago and declined due to a charge of $94 million related to the product campaign. Excluding the campaign charge, EBITDA was 18.3%, reflecting an incremental margin of 26%. The improved margins resulted from strong operational performance and the benefits of material cost reduction programs. Power Systems sales in the first quarter grew 22% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in engine and parts sales to mining and oil and gas customers. Sales of power generation products improved year-over-year for the third straight year \u2013 third straight quarter. EBITDA in the first quarter was 13.2% compared to 9.6% a year ago, resulting in an incremental margin of 30%. The benefits of stronger volumes, cost reduction programs, better execution on power generation projects and stronger joint venture earnings in China all contributed to the margin expansion. In the first quarter, we reported results of our electrified powertrain business for the first time. EBITDA was a loss of $10 million for the first quarter and losses will increase in subsequent quarters this year as we accelerate our investments in new product programs. Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the first quarter of 2018, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 22% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher levels of truck production, growth in sales of construction equipment, and increased demand for engines from mining, oil and gas and power generation customers. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks grew 44% in the first quarter of 2018, while sales of our heavy-duty engines increased 48%. Our market share through February was 34%, up 2% from last year. Production of medium-duty trucks improved 9% in the first quarter, while our engine shipments grew 26%. Our market share in the medium-duty truck market was 82% through February, up from 75% a year ago. Total shipments in our North American pickup truck customers decreased 22% compared to a year ago, due to a short-term adjustment in production by one of our OEM customers. Engine sales for construction equipment in North America increased 47% in the first quarter, reflecting increased customer confidence. Sales from engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America rose 79% compared to a year ago, driven by higher demand from oil and gas and mining customers. Revenues for power generation grew by 6% due to higher demand in the data center and recreational vehicle markets. Our international revenues increased by 20% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 3% due to lower sales in on-highway markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 9% compared to a year ago. Our OEM partners under-produced relative to the market in the first quarter and our share dipped to 12% from 14%. We expect the first quarter to mark the low point for our market share with improvement expected in subsequent quarters. Industry sales of light-duty truck grew by 7% in the first quarter and our engine market share was 7%. Demand for excavators in the third quarter increased 48% from a year ago in China. Our market share increased by 3% to 13% driven by strong performance by our customers, including LiuGong and Hyundai (09:32). Revenues for our Power Systems business in China increased 57% due to growth in engine shipments to mining customers and higher demand for power generation equipment for data centers. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $581 million, an increase of 43% from the first quarter a year ago due to growth in on- and off-highway markets and strong sales of new products in our Components business. Industry truck production increased 18% year-over-year, driven by growing industrial activity and government investments to develop infrastructure. Our market share in the quarter was 42%, up 300 basis points compared to the same period last year, largely due to strong market acceptance of our engine system technology for the Bharat Stage IV emissions regulations introduced last year. Our penetration at Tata rose to 90% in the quarter with both Tata and Cummins benefiting from strong product performance relative to the competition. Power generation revenues also grew 6%. In Brazil, all revenues increased by 46%, primarily due to a moderately recovering economy, resulting in improved demand for trucks and compared to a weak 2017. Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2018 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2018 to be up 10% to 14%, increasing our prior guidance of up 4% to 8%, reflecting a stronger outlook for truck production in North America, India and Brazil and increased demand from mining and oil and gas customers. We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 286,000 units, up 29% compared to 2017 and above our prior guidance of 266,000 units. We expect our market share to be between 31% and 34%, unchanged from our view last quarter. In the medium-duty truck market, we are maintaining our forecast for industry production to reach 124,000 units, up 5% year-over-year and we expect our market share to be in the range of 72% to 75%, also unchanged. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for the full year compared to a very strong 2017. In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 2% compared to our previous guidance of being down 5% in 2018. We have raised our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand slightly to 1.2 million units from 1.15 million units, representing a 10% decline from 2017. In the light-duty truck market, we expect demand to be flat in 2018, in line with our previous guidance. We expect our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be 14%. In the light-duty, we expect our share to be 8%, both up from first quarter levels. In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be at least 20% year-over-year relative to our previous guidance of up 15%, due to stronger truck demand. In Brazil, we now forecast truck production to increase 9% in 2018, up from our previous forecast of no growth. We expect our global high-horsepower engine shipments to increase 30%, up from our previous forecast of 10% growth, reflecting strong demand from mining and oil and gas customers and rising demand for power generation equipment. In summary, we've more than doubled our sales growth outlook for the year to 10% to 14%. And excluding the charge for the product campaign, we revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 16.2% to 16.6%, reflecting a full year incremental EBITDA margin of 28%. Demand in several of our core markets is improving, our products are performing well and we are excited about the investments we are making for the future. During the quarter, we returned $341 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Pat. Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's first quarter financial results before discussing the performance of the operating segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of the year. First quarter revenues were $5.6 billion, an increase of 21% from a year ago, and a quarterly record for the company. Sales increased in each of our operating segments primarily driven by stronger demand in global on-highway, construction, mining and oil and gas markets. Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our first quarter revenues, improved by 22% from a year ago, due to increased sales of engines and components to meet higher levels of heavy- and medium-duty truck production and an increase in demand for industrial engines. International sales improved by 20% from a year ago, primarily due to stronger demand in on-highway and industrial markets as well as benefiting from a weaker U.S. dollar. Gross margins were 21.5% of sales, down from 24.7% a year ago, primarily due to the product campaign charge that Tom referred to. The campaign charge negatively impacted our gross margin by 330 basis points. This offset the benefits realized from stronger volumes, favorable pricing, material cost reductions and our lower base warranty rate. Selling, admin and research and development costs of $787 million or 14.1% of sales decreased as a percent of sales by 130 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. Joint venture income of $115 million increased by $7 million compared to last year. EBITDA was $700 million or 12.6% of sales for the quarter compared to $705 million or 15.4% of sales a year ago. EBITDA as a percent of sales declined primarily due to the campaign charge, which more than offset the positive impact of higher sales, favorable pricing and cost improvements referred to earlier. Excluding the charge, EBITDA was $887 million or 15.9% of sales in the quarter. Net earnings for the quarter were $325 million or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $396 million or $2.36 from a year ago. In addition to the product campaign charge which lowered earnings per share by $0.87, first quarter earnings were negatively impacted by $78 million in discrete tax items or $0.45 per diluted share, most of which related to the tax reform bill passed back in December of 2017. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.9%. Excluding discrete tax items, the effective tax rate was 23%, in line with our full year guidance and down from 26.1% last year. Now moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize our performance in the quarter and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some cash flow highlights. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% from last year due to the 20% increase in on-highway sales as well as from stronger demand for engines for construction equipment in China and in North America, which led to a 23% growth in off-highway revenues in the quarter. Segment EBITDA in the first quarter was $286 million or 11.7% of sales. This compares to $273 million or 13.5% a year ago. The campaign charge and investments in new products more than offset the benefits from higher volumes and lower base warranty expense. Excluding the campaign charge, EBITDA margins for Engine segment was 15.5% of sales. We now expect full year revenues to be up 10% to 14% compared to our previous guidance of up 4% to 8%, due to an improved outlook in most of our markets. Our forecast for EBITDA margins for the segment is in the range of 13.5% to 14% of sales, which does include the campaign charge booked in the first quarter and that compares to 14% to 14.5% previously. For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 13% compared to last year. The growth in sales was primarily driven by stronger demand for both new engines and parts and service in North America, Europe and in China. The EBITDA margin for the quarter was $123 million or 6.6% of sales compared to 7.9% a year ago. The EBITDA percent declined due to lower earnings in Africa and in the Middle East as a result of weak demand and currency volatility and a lower mix of parts sales in North America. For the full year, Distribution revenue is projected to increase 6% to 10% compared to our previous guidance of up 2% to 6%, due to stronger off-highway demand for engines, parts and rebuilds. As Tom mentioned, we do expect profitability to improve in the second quarter and are forecasting full year EBITDA margins to be in the range of 7.75% to 8.25% of sales, unchanged from our previous guidance. For the Components segment, revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, a 30% increase from a year ago and a quarterly record. Excluding revenues from Eaton Cummins joint venture, sales were 22% higher than a year ago. Sales in North America increased by 35% due to higher heavy- and medium-duty truck production. International sales increased 25%, primarily due to growth in sales of aftertreatment sales in India. Segment EBITDA was $227 million or 12.9% of sales compared to $216 million or 16.1% last year. The benefits of higher sales, favorable material costs and strong operational performance were offset by the product campaign charge. Excluding the charge, EBITDA margins were 18.3% of sales in the quarter. For 2018, we now expect revenue to increase 18% to 22% compared to our prior guidance of up 8% to 12%. Strong demand in the North American truck market and in Europe are the key drivers behind the improved outlook. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 15.25% to 15.75% of sales which again includes the campaign charge booked in the first quarter and that compares to 15% to 15.5% in our previous forecast. In the Power Systems segment, first quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 22% from a year ago. Industrial sales grew by 51% driven by stronger mining and oil and gas demand. Power generation sales also increased by 9%. EBITDA margins were $142 million or 13.2% of sales in the quarter, up from $85 million or 9.6% last year, driven by the positive impact of stronger volumes, favorable material costs and higher joint venture earnings. For 2018, we now expect Power Systems segment revenues to increase 7% to 11% versus our prior guidance of up 4% to 8% as a result of stronger demand across industrial and power generation markets. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 13% and 13.5% of sales compared to our previous guidance of 12.25% to 12.75%. In the newly established Electrified Power segment, EBITDA losses were $10 million in line with our forecast. For the full year, we expect a net expense of between $60 million and $80 million in line with our previous guidance, as we are in a period of investment in new products. And for the company, we are raising our outlook as Tom said for revenues to be up 10% to 14% versus our previous guidance of up 4% to 8%. This increase is driven by higher levels of truck production in North America, increased demand for both engines, new engines and engine rebuilds for oil and gas and mining customers; and the appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency tailwinds are expected to increase our revenues by approximately $300 million this year. Income from our joint ventures is now expected to decrease by 10% in 2018 compared to our previous guidance of down 15%. The improvements in guidance reflects stronger market demand in China and India than we had previously forecast. We expect EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.4% to 15.8% for 2018, down from our previous forecast of 15.8% to 16.2%. Excluding the impact of the first quarter charge for the product campaign, full year EBITDA is expected to be in a range of 16.2% to 16.6%, reflecting a 28% incremental margin at the midpoint. Finally, turning to cash flow. Cash used in operating activities for the first quarter was $117 million due in part to higher working capital requirements associated with higher revenues as well as a payout of 2017 variable compensation. We anticipate operating cash flow in 2018 will be within our long-term guidance of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $72 million and we continue to expect our investments will be in the range of $730 million to $760 million for the full year. For the first quarter, we returned $341 million to shareholders through dividends and from the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares. For 2018, we continue to plan to return at least 50% of our operating cash flow to our shareholders, which is in line with our previous guidance. Now let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Pat. We're ready to turn to the Q&A section of the call. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm wondering if you could talk about the size of the field population that's impacted by the field campaign, the cost per repair. And obviously, you've been leveraging the technology platform across markets and emission standards. Can you talk about if there's any other potential applications that could be impacted by the field campaigns that you're doing now? Can you just frame that for us? Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. Hey, Jerry, this is Rich. Let me \u2013 couple of things here. You've got a few questions in there. So first, the piece we're looking at is a component on the aftertreatment system that we used only in North America. It was for engines 2010 through 2015, predominantly 2010 through 2012, okay, as we phased that product out beginning in 2013. What we've done is we've looked at the entire population over that, so it's a fixed amount of what the population is. And what we proposed here to the agencies and what we've recorded in $187 million is a combination of, in some cases, no action that these products are going to be fine; in some cases, a software fix; and, in some cases, a hardware fix, okay. So, that's what the charge is related to. Of course, we'll have to get approval from the agencies on this. The discussions are collaborative and good with the agencies. It does not affect any other products anywhere else in North America or any other part of the world. This is a very specific component that was used that is under evaluation right now. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, separately, yeah, it sounds like within Power Systems, you're seeing an inflection in orders, within power generation for the first time, probably five or so years. Can you just give us some context on which applications for power gen that you're seeing the most momentum, which markets? And can you just give us a sense for how much visibility you have based on the order cadence so far this year? Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Hey, Jerry, it's Mark. So we've seen an improvement in most parts of the world, except the Middle East which remains patchy. I would say the common theme across the regions is strong demand from data centers and then it varies by segment. But generally, a steady increase across those markets, and that's the third straight quarter of year-over-year increase. So, not \u2013 you know, it's not extraordinary acceleration, but it feels like we've got some momentum. Typically, we have an order board that runs multiple quarters, but, obviously, high confidence in the next 90 days. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And, Mark, just a clarification, it sounds like that order board has built in terms of the visibility, is that... Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Yes. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...am I parsing the comments correctly? Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: You are. Yes. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to return to Jerry's question. I'm trying to assess the customer dissatisfaction risk related to the field campaign. Could you help us with the failure mode? Is it purely emissions falling out of compliance? Or are there any, what I'll call, operational performance degradation, like, seem to occur in the light vehicle campaign a few years ago? Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Okay, yes. So as far as performance either what the customer feels on productivity of the vehicle or fuel economy, there's no impact there. So it's purely an emissions issue, kind of late life emissions beyond even the warranty of the product that as the product degrade. So the impact on customers will be, like I said, in some cases, nothing. In some cases, we'll bring it in and do a calibration. In some cases, we'll bring it in and change the hardware out, and it'll be a voluntary recall. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, Rich. And then within \u2013 we're all trying to figure out if the charge may get closer to $400 million and I'm sure you're not going to talk about that, given the discussions with the regulatory agencies. But, could you talk about the failure rate that you're observing in the field? I mean, is this pretty widespread, or is it at this point concentrated? Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yes. I mean, what we know is what we're saying right now is the population that we've got today. So anything else, I'd be really speculating on. What I will say is we're driven to resolve this thing over the next two quarters and so we'll work with agencies and we'll get a final answer to this and kind of get this thing behind us. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: I think, Andy, just from my point of view too \u2013 this is Tom talking by the way \u2013 we wanted to make sure that the investors could at least put a box around what we think the total size could be. We have taken \u2013 as we have to, we had taken the accrual for what we think is the best estimate for what it will cost us across all this work. But because the agencies have the right to ask us to do other things, we have to be and we will have to respond to that. We want to make sure that investors could \u2013 after some quarters of uncertainty which is not terrific, we want to make sure these people could put a box around it. Again, we are very \u2013 we think our plan is a good one. That's why we're proposing it and we intend to take care of customers as well as take care of the environment. That's kind of our commitment to both. So, we're acting proactively on that both. Again, just to try to make sure everyone had a box to put it in, and again we are working really aggressively and we expect to be through these discussions relatively quickly in the six months or less. So hopefully, we'll have it \u2013 we'll have all of it behind us. But again, it's not \u2013 we are now at a spot where we are confident we can address this problem proactively, it will have minimal impact on customers and our products are performing well in the field. It's not going to impact the company's future or our ability to carry out our strategy plans, so, that's \u2013 we're feeling good about that. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then just to dot the I, does the $400 million include the $29 million from Q3? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: No, the $400 million is not trying to sum up everything in the past, it's trying to say here is the maximum exposure that we could see in a worst case for what our actions going forward. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: In addition to what we booked. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yes. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, it's in addition to the $187 million. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: So the $187 million is what we've already booked and the old ones we've already booked. And we're saying this is the maximum future exposure in addition to what we booked in this quarter and previous quarters. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Good morning, Jamie. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I've got a few questions. Hello. Tom, the product campaign cost, how do you guys think about this in the context of how it impacts incentive compensation for you guys? Are you guys excluding this? Do we include this? And then my second question, a lot of other industrial companies have talked about supplier constraints, higher freight constraints, labor constraints. Can you talk about to what degree this is impacting your customers or yourself? And how much that's constraining demand if at all? And how that sort of impacts your thoughts on 2019 as the market is concerned about sort of achieving the peak in 2018? Thanks. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Jamie. I'll let Rich take the second one. I'll take the first one. So this charge along with all similar charges related to quality of our products, we take directly against our variable comp. So our view is our management and our people are responsible for producing quality products. When we have to take a charge against our quality, we take the hit in our bonus and other plans. So we will take this \u2013 this accrual we took this quarter and previous ones all account against us in both our one-year compensation plans as well as our three-year compensation plans. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: And Jamie, this is Rich. Then, on the constraints, we're certainly seeing all the constraints that you read about and everyone else sees. But what we are \u2013 I think we're positioned right now, we talked about over sometime our supply base is pretty flexible. And we're actually seeing, we're seeing some evidence of it today that if things have ramped up, we are ramping up a little better than other folks. It's actually an opportunity to pick up share. So, we're seeing some small bits of this. We are paying some incremental premium freight; those type of things, like everyone else is paying there. But so far so good. So nothing has caused us to increase lead times, put product on allocation, et cetera. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then to what degree, does that impact your sales (34:06) in 2019? Just as the markets concerned about, the markets are too good, we're getting overheated. Where does this impact to some degree (34:14) the cycle? Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: To be determined. I'd say the nice thing that we are seeing is we get the ramp up and we're seeing the back orders go up, we look particularly in North America. The underlying fundamentals are pretty good though, as to what freight \u2013 how freight is doing, what rates are doing, which we're all seeing, and we're seeing in some of those, but the underlying fundamentals look pretty good right now kind of supporting that increase in demand. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks. Maybe a follow-up to that. I mean, I think certainly price cost trade-off has been kind of a key theme of earnings for the industrials so far this quarter. And if we just strip out the warranty charge, it looks like you may be expecting slightly lower incremental margins than before. Can you talk about how you are managing your cost input inflation? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Noah, this is Tom. It's a great question. As you said, price cost is really the struggle for industrial companies, but I think we're in really good position on that. We are now as we showed in this forecast, we're expecting quite significant improvement in incremental margins. So, again, we think we're doing well there. We mentioned as we came into this year that we're going to have \u2013 we have benefits on warranty. The warranty rates this year relative to last year are improving. We've got strong incremental margins in our plants in both the Power Systems business and the Engine business. And you saw a very strong in the Components already. So we feel like we're not only doing well in incremental margins, but they're getting better as the year goes on both because we're able to get some pricing and we're moving costs down. So that \u2013 so we're feeling pretty good about that. Again, one way you might want to think about our incremental margins is to again even taking out the product campaign, if you also look at the costs associated with the Eaton Cummins joint venture and the new electrification view which are sort of long-term investments, if you take those out, you get a like-for-like comparison on an incremental margins across the years. And I think, again, you'll find not only was Q1 good, but the rest of the year looks very strong relative to Q1. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And actually anticipating my next question. If you could touch on some of those newer growth initiatives, it looks like you've increased your Eaton JV contribution expectations for the year. Our checks are saying AMT adoption is going quite well. Looks like you lowered electric revenue contribution a little bit for the year, again up a very small base, but could you give us a little bit of color on how you see both of those initiatives proceeding? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Sure. I'll comment a little bit on electrification and let maybe Rich talk about Eaton Cummins and AMT. So on electrification, as you said, we did touchdown revenue a little bit. That just reflects basically the rate of new product introduction acceptance as very low level. Our programs are still going well. We're just very early days. And really the big launch has come sort at the end of next year. We'll see some \u2013 that's where our new electrified powertrain gets launched in the buses. And so \u2013 but we're feeling really good about where we stand. We've got small products going into forklifts. We've got these bigger powertrains going into buses. We're clearly \u2013 we're talking to nearly every customer out there about Electrified Power in some way. So our position from a few years ago where we have a lot of work in the lab and a lot of really good ideas to where we've got a pretty significant position now on the market in terms of what we're planning to offer and we're working with I think has been a really good change and really good transition. Now, of course, we've got to launch the products and see success in them. So, that's our big focus over the next two years or 1 1/2 years. So Rich, let me \u2013 this is to you. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. So on the Eaton joint venture, just a couple of numbers. So the AMT you asked about the transition, we're up to 73% now. So, that's coming along as we thought potentially little higher. Our market share is where we thought it would be. So the Cummins/Eaton joint venture market share is good. The transition has gone quite well. So the cultures anytime you're merging two things together, there's some risk. You just come together really well. The culture has been good, the team work is good and so really so far so good. The sales forecast, so last year $163 million will be over $450 million this year in revenues out of the joint venture. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning. First, on the mining side, I think last quarter you were looking for up about 10%, that's moved higher, but any context around how much higher you think mining is at this point? And then if you could talk specifically to equipment side of things versus parts side of things, and regionally where you're seeing some of the activity pick up? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. I'll take a first shot at this Mark, and make sure you get the numbers right. I think, right now, we're projecting 30% up on mining for revenues. So, improved from where we were last quarter. We pay attention to what utilization is, so what is \u2013 how is equipment really being utilized and we're seeing that continue to increase, which helps drive parts demand and rebuild activity, primarily the activity, the biggest increases are in North America and China, which wouldn't surprise you on that. Mark, anything you would add to that? Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: No, just Q1 probably was the easiest comp of the year. We were up about 48%, (40:22) good, and we're seeing good growth in new engines and parts, that strengthened a little bit since the start of the year. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then some interesting news yesterday with the launch of a new transmission into frac rigs and just kind of a timeline for how long it'll take for you to get enough experience on the ground with that transmission for the expectation that you get some decent customer adoption? And then just a clarification on whether that's just a pair with Cummins' engines or whether that could be paired with competitor engines as well? Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: I think that's principally to be paired with Cummins engines at this point in time, yeah. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And I guess maybe just one more then. You're talking about market share and seeing opportunities for gains and maybe being a little bit more agile in terms of response to supply chain tightness. You're not really calling for increases in market share in medium-duty. It doesn't look like increasing market share in engines in North America heavy-duty. So should we just think about that may be now favors the high end of the range or a little bit of conservatism there? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: I think primarily in the high end of the range, we bounced back pretty well. In fact, we've seen some share gains in surface mining whether it's only attributable to the ramp up. Again, we're keeping our lead times low in all of our high-horsepower markets. We're down in the eight-week range, which is good, which is better than the competition at this time. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research : Thanks. Good morning. Wondering if you could talk about how the warranty issue might affect your thinking or execution of anything strategic that you've been thinking about. It seems like it will be a cash out the door issue at some point. But maybe it doesn't dramatically alter your balance sheet on what you might do, but just curious how you're thinking about that? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Steve. Yeah, it hasn't really changed our strategic thinking. As you say, the cash flow and balance sheet is manageable. That's a little bit why we wanted to make sure we put a box around even the worst case. And again, we have a clear view about what we want to do, but we want to make sure everyone saw the worst case, it goes out over two or three years. We feel very, very good about where our strategic position is. But again, the way that we've been thinking about this, we talked about in previous quarters that the complexity of the systems that we're offering is pretty high and the quality tools that we're using have \u2013 needed to get more sophisticated as a result. So we've been making significant investments using analytics and other things to get a better system view of the quality of our products which we think is reflected in the products we're launching today and we'll continue to enhance those quality tools as we go forward. And again from the strategy point of view, it's difficult. We feel frustrated and disappointed, obviously, with the cost of this quality campaign. But again, we are pushing on the cutting edge of offering systems that meet emissions \u2013 very, very stringent emissions targets, have very, very good \u2013 strong fuel economy and high levels of performance at the very edge of technology. And I think part of what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay at the edge there while improving our quality costs. And that's the tough deal, I mean, that's not going to be easy and that's why a lot of people aren't going to make the journey. And we think by getting better in those capabilities, we can stay in it and make good returns for our shareholders by getting better at the sort of executions, small details of being there at that edge of technology. So, that's the way we're thinking about it strategically. And the harder the challenge, the less people want to do it. And so from a strategy point of view, that's a good thing as long as we can make \u2013 continue to improve how our system quality goes out the door and how customers experience our products. Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.: And, Steve, and we expect \u2013 I think I said this in my remarks, but we expect another very, very strong year in terms of the free cash flow we generate through our operations. So as Tom said, this will have no impact at all on what we're going to do from a strategic perspective. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research : Okay. So just to follow up on the M&A angle here. How are you finding the competition for deals at the moment and how does it vary depending on size of the deals that you maybe looking at? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. As you guess, there is still competition for M&A today. There's some players in the market, valuations are still relatively high. Money, while getting a little bit more expensive, it's still pretty cheap. So there's no question that the cost of acquisitions still, especially if we were going to maintain the ROIC discipline that we intend to, that's going to play into it. We're going to have to be thoughtful about how that goes and that remains a challenge. But again, we continue to think about our strategy first. Where do we think Cummins can bring our capabilities into a new market and adjacent market and using capabilities we already have and leveraging them so that we can \u2013 whatever we acquire or joint venture with, we can add value to it, so that we can pay for the acquisition price as well as trying to get an attractive one. And that of course limits the field, right? That means there's only so many things that are going to work and we are making sure that we maintain patience with that. We are looking a lot of things, though. There are things to look at that are pretty interesting. And so, we're just trying to put those together. I feel better about it now than I have in the past. I mean, it was \u2013 the prices, while still high, are not nearly as bad as when we started looking at them. So I'm optimistic that they're beginning to come into the range where we think we could make it work. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research : Great. Thanks, guys. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, guys. I had a couple of questions I guess on the lighter-duty side of the on-highway business. First of all, in Europe, I'm wondering the extent to which you think you can pick up any business from OEMs that you maybe historically had struggled to do business with because of Dieselgate or any of the other stigma associated with diesel engines in general. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks for that question, Alex. So I would say that, we do believe that kind of to fall into Steve's question that indeed many of our customers are looking forward at the market and saying where do they want to place their investments strategically? Do they want \u2013 they've got a lot of challenges in front of them, autonomous vehicles, electrified vehicles, all of the investments they need to make for just the truck \u2013 making the truck work, telematics, you name it. And then, now with the challenges for diesels in some of the European cities, they are asking themselves how much investment do I want to make? In the light-duty side, it's the most challenged. It's one that have the most likely substitution from electrified powertrains. So again, each investment they make there, they're wondering how many more diesels they're going to sell. So if we have a product that's relevant to what they are trying to do, they're much more likely to buy from us than do it themselves these days than they were, say, 10 years ago. So we believe that this is a trend that will continue where OEMs will continue to wonder how many more investments, how many more platforms in the light-duty space and even in the medium-duty space, do I really want to make given I could buy this from Cummins, and I would, therefore, not have to make that investment and I can focus on my vehicle instead. So again, we'll see how it goes, but we are talking to a lot of people about that and more people than we are talking to for sure five or 10 years ago. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I guess one maybe follow-up on that. You mentioned medium-duty. That market I know is \u2013 clearly, the cyclicality is less violent than it is in Class 8, but that market just seems to continually march higher and higher and higher. I'm wondering the extent to which you think there's been a structural change to the way that type of functions to the extent you can even call it a cycle. Or if you think it's a secular story there as a result of last mile and some of the changes that are occurring to the way the freight markets function in general? Thanks. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yes. Alex, so I'm not sure we know the answer to that. But it does appear, it has been less cyclical, it has been steadily growing, okay? And so our view is all the underlying cases I wouldn't want to speak \u2013 I wouldn't be able to speak to. But I do think it feels pretty sustained and it's tied to more than just the on-highways, it's tied to the construction market, infrastructure being invested in around the world. And so it does seem to have a more staying power and we're kind of reflecting that now, plus cyclicality more staying power. Has there been a fundamental step up I guess is still to be determined. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC : Thanks. Your discussion on the EPA/CARB issue is fairly clear and thanks for bounding the lower end as well. Could you just give a more general overview of how you approach quality as the issues popped up over the last year and you mentioned a renewed focus? Have you changed monitoring or proactive looking at stuff? And do you feel that there's a less of a chance of future issues popping up as a result of what you're seeing? And how is your quality trending in general? Thanks. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Thanks for the question. As you could imagine, while this is \u2013 there's a specific cause here. We're using this as a call to action. So how do we make some incremental improvements on where we are now or even step function improvements where we are? So we are investing heavier in analytics, in modeling, in looking at all of our processes to drive improvement. We've been in the kind of the low-2% range for some time, okay. With warranty periods being extended, more expectations, we've maintained kind of that 2% to 2.5%. And so, we're doing a couple of things. One is, we're putting actions in place to how this would never ever, ever happen again, okay, the modeling. And so, we've got those in place, but we're also saying, let's bring an outside look in and say use this as a call to action to how do we drive this down over the next five years to a much lower number. And I think you know our track record and when we put our resources and put our efforts towards achieving (52:01) our track record and delivering, that's pretty darn good. And so, this one's getting a lot of attention as you can imagine, even though the one case is somewhat isolated. Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.: And then just as a follow-up to that Rob, you recall last year (52:16), were around 3.1%, 3.2% of sales and we (52:21) drive that lower. We did see that in Q1, Q1 is right around 2.4% and we're still pretty consistent with the previous guidance and the full year forecast of 2.4% for the full year. So to Rich's point, we are making progress with the base one there. Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC : Great. Thanks to both of you. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is (52:49) on for Ann. All my questions have been answered. Thanks. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is now open. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. How is it going? Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Hi, Joel. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just can you give a little more granularity on China? It seems like most people were expecting it to be down this year and it's surprised to the upside in the first half and I think people are a little cautious about how the second half is going to flow and you guys have a great lot of feet on the ground there. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. Joel, I think, we would agree with that caution. I think, we just look at the truck equipment purchases versus what we perceive trucking to be \u2013 growth rates to be doing and freight rates and everything. It just doesn't seem like the same rate of growth from the previous year can hold. So, that's why we sort of forecasted it tipping over and heading down. A couple of things that have driven a little stronger truck performance in the first quarter was more construction, which, of course, we saw in the excavator numbers. So dumper sales increased a lot, which is again one of the reasons that our OEMs kind of under-produced relative to the market. That's not their big segment, the dumper market. Those tend to be bigger displacement engines and older technology. But nonetheless, those sales were really quite good in the first quarter, the dumper sales, so again, which is towards construction market. So I think what we're seeing in China is, yes, there is the equipment being purchased for just on-highway trucking is likely to level out or head down. At least that's our expectation, we'll see what happens, but that's our expectation, but this construction market is definitely buoying the market. It's better than we expected and it's great news. I mean, we're seeing much \u2013 a lot of good demand for construction engines as well and these off-highway kind of dumper sort of truck engines. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Just to put a number on that. So, on the off-highway, we're projecting an 8% increase. We're now saying 20% to 25%, which is what we said first quarter because that felt more sustained and less cyclical than what was going on in the truck market. And both of those seem to be playing out a little bit. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And maybe second, just maybe a little bit of a delicate question. But in terms of the rail business, obviously, the industry consolidation, it's not really happening or maybe it is a little bit. But I just wondered if you could talk about how you feel that like you are positioned in that market. And do you feel like you have the product lineup and kind of your toe in the water there enough to continue to gain share and really compete effectively in that market? Thank you. I'm done after that. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Joel, thanks for that question. Not delicate, it's fine. We're pretty small in the rail market overall. If you just kind of think about rail globally, we're pretty small player and we have participated essentially in the diesel part of the rail rather than the diesel electric side, which was driving from much larger engines and again that trend has continued. So we have had a segment that we participate in. Now the introduction of the Hedgehog engines got us into more of that. But still we're really just getting into it. And I think what's helped us get a little bit of a toehold there has been the fact that we were ready with our tier four engines before other people and I think our solution is better. It's a better long-term total cost of ownership and so we have a bit of an advantage. We don't have the same advantage of being a large player already in the market. Everybody knows our product, and, therefore, a long history. So I still think \u2013 while we're excited about it because it's incrementally larger for us, it's still a small piece of the market. And I think if we don't add more products to our portfolio, that's kind of where we'll play sort of on the edge of the market, trying to grow our position with the business we have, but not a big player in the overall scheme of things globally. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mark Smith for any closing remarks. Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Hi, this is Tom Linebarger. Thanks for that. I just want to make a couple concluding remarks, especially given the fact that we did finally be able to put a box around that product campaign. And obviously, we're really disappointed about the financial exposure and we know that it's not the first one we've done the last two years, it's been a series of them. And again, as you'd guessed that, we feel disappointed and personally accountable for that. And we are, as we talked about in the call, working really hard to make sure that we do not see a repeat of that, and, of course, that's what we think the core of our business is. The good news looking forward though is we do have a box around this. We do have a proposed plan. We will get the full plan resolved in the next six months or something like that. And it's not going to impact either the long-term performance of the company or our strategy so \u2013 and it's not impacting customers today. Customers today are experiencing great quality, good performing engines, and continue to see Cummins as the technology of choice. We've raised our outlook for this year. Again, it'll be a second terrific year for the company. Our sales growth forecast is now doubled. Our incremental margins are strong. Our businesses are performing well. We had -three of our four had terrific incremental margins in Q1. The DBU, while not as good, will see much improved margins in the next three quarters. So we feel like we are in a really good position to generate strong cash flows and strong earnings this year and our strategy's right on track. So I just want to make sure that everyone knew that about where we feel about where the company is as we feel like we're moving right towards strength here and we're very optimistic about this year. And we're going to get this emissions issue behind us and customers are still going to see Cummins as the technology of choice. Thanks very much. Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, everybody. We'll be available for questions later. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

Jay Craig : Thanks, Carl, and good morning. Let's turn to slide 3. We're happy to report today strong sales and profits for the quarter. For the second fiscal quarter of 2018, we had sales of more than $1 billion, a 32% increase year-over-year. This was primarily due to higher production in all our global markets, new business wins, and favorable foreign exchange. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.4%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 114%. As I said, these results reflect the higher levels of production in our end markets globally. You'll see later in the presentation that we are raising our market outlook for the year in nearly every region. Even as markets are growing, we continue to gain rear axle share with our largest customers. In high markets like these, our customers know they can rely on us to meet their demand. It goes without saying, however, that at these volumes we are seeing some stress in the system. The good news is that, although incurred some premium freight and higher labor and burden costs as a result, we are still converting well and consequently are raising our guidance for the year. I attribute this to the diligent execution of our team in effectively meeting the needs of our customers while at the same time efficiently managing the supply chain complexities and incremental costs inherent at these volume levels. I am pleased to tell you that with the revenue tailwinds we expect to continue in the second half, in addition to the new business wins and other outperformance to the market, our full-year guidance has improved measurably. Kevin will give you the details, but I want to highlight that, at the top end of our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, is now higher than the aggressive M2019 EPS target of $2.84, which you may remember was an 80% improvement from our jump off point in fiscal year 2015. Throughout the entire M2019 time frame, we have earned meaningful new business, increased our share with current customers and converted on increased revenue as global end markets have strengthened simultaneously. We have talked several times about our balanced approach to capital allocation that we have executed for the past several years. We are currently on track to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1.5 times this year, a year earlier than planned. Our consistent free cash flow generation provides funding opportunities for strategic growth initiatives while also returning value to shareholders through share repurchases. We executed on both of these actions over the past several months. We bought back 1.4 million common shares in the quarter and earlier this week we acquired the business of AA Gear & Manufacturing. More on this important transaction in a couple of minutes. Also in the quarter, we announced executive repositioning. In addition to his responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Nowlan will now lead our Trailer and Components businesses and Global Purchasing. Joe Plomin will continue to lead Global Aftermarket business with additional responsibility for Industrial, which includes off-highway, specialty and defense. And Chris Villavarayan continues to run our global truck group, as we announced in January. He is also taking the lead on our electrical technology offering that we'll talk more about today. In conjunction with the organizational changes, we modified the Company's financial reporting segments, which are now Commercial Truck & Trailer, Aftermarket & Industrial. We filed an 8-K on Monday with recast results for these segments. Last quarter we gave you an in-depth look at our business in China. This quarter, as we turn to slide 4, we want to highlight the recovery we're seeing in South America and talk about the new business we recently were awarded with important customers in that region. From an economic perspective, Brazil's GDP is expected to grow between 2.5% to 3% this year. This improvement is accelerating truck sales. We anticipate growth in this market for medium and heavy-duty trucks to be approximately 35% year-over-year. And even with this significant increase, production volumes are still well below peak levels we saw in 2011, leaving us more room for market growth in the coming years. As trucks volumes rise, we are pleased to announce new business wins in Brazil with important long-term customers. First, we will supply front and rear axles for MAN's new delivery truck, in addition to supplying our hub reduction axle for the Constellation heavy-duty truck application. We have also been awarded axle business with Mercedes-Benz and IVECO for school buses. Obviously, this improvement in the market is a welcome change following the severe recession of the past few years. We have an excellent team in Brazil and look forward to continued growth in the region. If you turn to slide 5, you'll see more detail on the AA Gear & Manufacturing transaction. On April 30, we closed a deal to purchase substantially all the assets of AA Gear and its subsidiaries. We expect revenue from this transaction to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million next fiscal year. Most importantly, however, we believe it's suite of process engineering and production capabilities for gear and shaft components will help accelerate our growth strategy. AA Gear has strong customer relationships with some of the world's leading OEM and Tier 1 manufacturers across a wide range of end markets, including agriculture, construction, heavy truck and diversified industrials. Key customers include Caterpillar and CNH Industrial. We believe this is an excellent fit for Meritor and strongly aligns with our M2019 objectives. Let's turn to slide 6. On May 1, at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in Long Beach, California, we introduced our new Meritor Blue Horizon technology brand. We chose this venue to introduce Blue Horizon because of the significant presence of several OE customers in North America who are advancing their interest in electric drivetrain technology. The Blue Horizon brand reflects a move toward even more innovation and advanced technology. It also represents a product evolution and revolution to meet the different needs of existing and new customers. Most importantly, it supports the continuation of our leadership in engineering and advanced technology. All Blue Horizon products will be grounded in the Meritor tradition of reliability and durability, even as our solutions become lighter, more efficient and more technically sophisticated. Products launched under Blue Horizon will deliver flexibility in global platforms, integration of motors into axles and customized gearing for all segments of the commercial vehicle industry. In past quarters we have talked about the number of electric vehicle programs we have won globally. That number continues to grow. Meritor's experience and insight are vital to the creation of an entirely new electrical architecture that maximizes power, technology, efficiency and safety on the road. Whether it's battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, we will offer a completely integrated system that can be installed on an existing vehicle or glider, or a kit that can be installed on an OEM assembly line. Our new integrated eAxle system is the next step in the evolution of electric drivetrains, putting batteries between the frame rails and powering the axle directly for reduced energy loss and weight. As we said previously, we are confident that this expansion of our capabilities is one of the best opportunities for long-term growth. To that end, we are very pleased to announce, as we turn to slide 7, that Meritor, through its strategic alliance with TransPower, is collaborating with Peterbilt to equip 12 all electric Class 8 day cab tractors and three refuse trucks with all electric drivetrain systems. Meritor will supply high efficiency and lightweight axles, drive lines, and brakes that maximize system efficiency, extend range and increase payload. Electric drive train power and control systems, as well as batteries and accessories, will be supplied by TransPower. The 80,000 pound short-haul Peterbilt drayage trucks will support operations at ports throughout California, including Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego and Oakland. Two Peterbilt refuse haulers will be tested by Sacramento County and a waste hauler will operate the third truck. The Meritor and TransPower systems are expected to deliver a 125 mile operating range for the drayage trucks and up to 95 miles for the refuse haulers. Our understanding of customer needs enables us to create the products that can do what needs to be done regardless of the class, segment or rating. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on the financials, and then we'll take your questions. Kevin Nowlan : Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call I'll review our second-quarter financial results and our updated 2018 guidance. As you heard from Jay, we had a really strong quarter of financial performance. We saw revenue increase by $260 million, expanded adjusted EBITDA by $40 million and accelerated the progress toward achievement of our M2019 targets. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 8, where you'll see our second-quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $1.066 billion in the quarter, with every major region reporting stronger revenue relative to last year. In North America, Class 8 truck production was 73,000 units, up 22,000 trucks from a year ago. We believe that production levels will continue to expand for the remainder of the year due to strong net order intake in recent months. Sales in Europe were also up, primarily driven by an appreciating euro. Beyond North America and Europe, we're seeing our other major markets China, India and Brazil growing year-over-year. And while end markets are strengthening, we're also seeing the benefit of revenue outperformance globally. Driven primarily by the higher revenue, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $122 million and an 11.4% adjusted EBITDA margin. Overall we converted incremental revenue into EBITDA at the lower end of our historical range. As you can see from the chart on the right side of the slide, we are showing several discrete items that were part of the earnings walk year-over-year. First, we routinely reassess the environmental reserves required for all of our sites. As a result, we determined that we needed to accrue an incremental $8 million liability this quarter related to a legacy site. Additionally, last year you may recall that we settled a dispute with a joint venture and recorded a one-time legal charge of $10 million. As we've discussed over the last couple quarters, we have two items that will continue to impact year-over-year performance through the balance of this fiscal year. These include lower equity earnings in affiliates as a result of the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO JV at the end of last year. That resulted in lower year-over-year earnings of $5 million in the second quarter. And lower OPEB expense from the modifications we made to our US retiree healthcare benefits. That produced a $10 million year-over-year benefit in the second quarter. On the left side of the slide you can see that we expanded gross margin by 170 basis points over the last year to 16.7%, which is one of the highest on record. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $68 million or $0.75 per adjusted diluted share, a 114% increase over last year. And finally, free cash flow was $22 million this quarter. Expanding margins and higher adjusted income were somewhat offset by increased inventory levels as we support strong demand from our global customers. Let's move to slide 9, which details our second-quarter sales and EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. As Jay said, based on the new management structure we have modified our reportable segments to be Commercial Truck & Trailer and Aftermarket & Industrial. In our Commercial Truck & Trailer segment, sales increased by 38% to $854 million. The increase in revenue was not only driven by higher production in North America but also by significant increases in the rest of the world. In addition, we saw continued benefits from new business wins as well as favorable foreign currency impacts due to the strengthening euro. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $96 million, up $44 million from last year. EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Trailer came in at 11.2%, a 280 basis point increase over last year. The increases in both EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and the legal charge from last year that I previously mentioned. In our Aftermarket & Industrial segment, sales were $256 million, up 13% from last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in our Industrial business, which included revenue from the business we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $36 million, up $4 million compared to last year. EBITDA margin was 14.1% compared to 14.2% last year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the favorable impact from the changes to retiree medical benefits, partially offset by higher material and freight costs. On slide 10 I wanted to spend a few minutes discussing steel prices and tariffs since that has been a hot topic over the last couple months. In March, the US announced tariffs on raw steel imports. However, a number of countries granted exemptions from those tariffs. Our primary exposure to imported steel from nonexempt countries is on a small amount of raw steel purchases from China. We anticipate a relatively minimal direct impact on our 2018 earnings from these tariffs. However, since January, we have seen a significant increase in the hot-rolled coil index, which is up 27%, while the scrap index is up a modest 3%. These are two key indices for our North America businesses. In a majority of our Commercial Truck & Trailer sales contracts, we have recovery mechanisms linked to market indices that adjust prices on an average lag of six months. In our Aftermarket business, there is not a similar contractual mechanism to adjust prices. Pricing changes are usually made one or two times each year subject to overall market conditions. Due to the increases we are seeing thus far in steel prices, linked primarily to changes in certain indices, we're anticipating a second-half headwind of approximately $5 million, which is included in our updated 2018 earnings outlook. Next I'll review our updated fiscal year 2018 global market outlook on slide 11. Due to the level of first half production, combined with strong Class 8 orders, a healthy backlog to build ratio, and continued positive economic fundamentals, we are increasing our North America Class 8 truck production estimate by 15,000 units to a range of 300,000 to 310,000 in 2018. In Brazil, industrial production is continuing to accelerate as the economic recovery gains momentum. Business and consumer confidence are also improving, which is supporting the market's expectation of higher growth. As a result, we are increasing our production estimates for 2018 by 25%. India is also seeing increasing production levels driven by an improving economy and significant infrastructure investment. We have increased our 2018 outlook there by approximately 15%. And finally, we continue to see a significant revenue increase in China, both in our Chinese construction and mining business and in our export business. As a result, we now expect revenue in 2018 to be approximately $190 million to $210 million, up about 10% from our prior outlook and more than double where we were just two years ago in that business. Overall, we see growth continuing in most of our major markets around the globe. And that, along with the success of various revenue performance initiatives, is driving our strong performance. Based on these market assumptions, you can see on slide 12 that we are again raising our 2018 guidance. We are now forecasting revenue to be in a range of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance. We're expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 11.2%, which is at the high-end of our prior guidance. We expect that the higher adjusted EBITDA net of tax will drop right to the bottom line, so we are also raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $2.70 to $2.85 per share. Just to reiterate what Jay said earlier, we are excited that we are now on the cusp of achieving our M2019 adjusted diluted EPS target of $2.84 a full year ahead of plan. And finally, based on our higher earnings expectations, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to be in a range of $120 million to $135 million. We are very pleased with our performance so far in 2018 as we continue to execute on our journey to delivering on our M2019 commitments. Now we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Potter : Good quarter. I wanted to ask first about some of the supply chain stress you mentioned in the prepared remarks. If you could elaborate a little bit on where specifically you are feeling it, what parts of the supply chain seem to be pinch points, and then the extent to which you're able to capitalize on maybe pinch points elsewhere to win market share for yourself. Jay Craig : Thanks, Alex. This is Jay. Very good question. I would say, as we typically see in strong upturns like this, we're seeing it in base forgings and castings. So, not unlike the past upturns we've executed successfully on. We have some layered capacity suppliers we bring online at slightly higher cost, and that's why you see even though we're converting at what I think are strong margins, strong incrementals, they are slightly lower than we have in previous quarters just because of bringing on that incremental capacity. We actually are right now backfilling for some of our competitors. So, we've once again been asked to step in and been able to successfully do that. I don't want to understate how the whole industry feels right now, though. I think the entire industry is operating very close to capacity, which we are as well. Alex Potter : Okay, understood. Maybe a little bit more on China, too. Obviously there's strength there in off-highway and construction and infrastructure, and you touched on exports as well. I'm interested to hear the extent to which you are starting to get additional traction in the on-highway business in China. Maybe not now; I sort of doubt it was impacting the quarter, maybe I'm wrong. But have you any incremental evidence to suggest that you might be able to start capturing more revenue in that segment going forward? Jay Craig : Sure. Yes, another good question, Alex. We talked about China, focused on that last quarter, like we focused on Brazil this quarter. And we have had market share gains and wins in the on-highway, particularly in bus and coach, continuing with Yutong and our other bus and coach customers, in bringing forth a tool light product that we've been integrating into China, which is taking our class leading Western axles and localizing them in China to get them to the right price points. So, we're seeing good progress. And I would say on path to the plan that we set out a year or so ago to increase our penetrations in that area. Alex Potter : Okay. Thanks very much. Good quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Faheem Sabeiha of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Faheem Sabeiha : Congrats on a great quarter. Can you bucket the $200 million increase in your revenue outlook between higher end market growth, outperformance from new business wins and FX? Kevin Nowlan : It's a mix of really those first two in particular. The markets are a big piece of the equation. As we've told you, when you look at Class 8 truck, just to put some dimension around that, taking the midpoint of our guidance of about 15,000 trucks translates to about $60 million. So what that tells you is, hey, that's a big contributor, but there's a lot of things going on as well. Brazil production going up is a meaningful increase, as well as other markets and new business wins. So it's really a mix of those things across the globe. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And then speaking of Brazil, in light of the more positive outlook in South America, can you guys tell us what your market share is in South America? I mean, you highlighted a few recent axle wins in your slide deck; I'm just wondering if there's additional share opportunity for Meritor in this market. Jay Craig : I think we haven't talked about specific market share, but I think we have talked about that we have a market leading position in Brazil, and continue to grow upon that with the wins that we talked about with the various OEs during this call. And that's no surprise as we localize more products into that market, like the hub reduction axle, like our medium-duty product, the 13X. We expected to get market share gains as we expand our product offerings in the local market. So, I think as we stretch our product portfolio, even though we have strong market share positions in traditional Class 8 single reduction axles, we're starting to see the increased penetration from the new product launches we have there. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And just one more question around EV. Now that we're seeing the benefit of your investment in TransPower, combined with your EV offerings with the recent Peterbilt program, is the long-term plan essentially to offer these platforms on a nationwide scale? Jay Craig : Actually on a global scale. We are taking the technology solutions offered by TransPower and actually rolling those out globally. So, that partnership is much broader than just California or just the US. Quite frankly, we see more demand right now globally for our eAxle than we are able to meet in this prototype phase, so we're almost allocating them to individual regions and our major strategic customers. So, that's what one of the powers we saw that investment and partnership in TransPower, they saw as well, is given that we're one of the few true global brands in commercial vehicle supplier world, we could bring enormous value to TransPower by bringing their products globally. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. George Clark : This is George Clark on for Joe. You touched on this earlier, but are you confident that you will be able to continue to drive incremental margins in that mid to high teens range throughout the rest of the year despite some of the higher industry volume? And how are you offsetting some of those inefficiencies? Kevin Nowlan : Our guidance assumes right now you can see we took our revenue guidance up $200 million, and implicit in that is that we took up our conversion on that about 15%. So, we're continuing to count on our ability to convert kind of at the low end of our historic range, which tends to be what we see in these types of markets. But we manage it very closely, and we watch the potential for layered capacity costs and other inefficiencies coming in, but we're managing that very effectively, like right now. It gets more challenging as markets continue to accelerate and to grow, but we've done an effective job at managing that thus far. George Clark : Okay. And then you guys had another strong backlog quarter. Are you seeing some of these measures come on earlier than you had previously expected? Is that pulling forward from maybe 2019? What is the dynamic there? Kevin Nowlan : I think by and large there's two things going on. One is we had a lot of volume, new business wins coming on that we anticipated would come on in the year 2018. We had big amounts coming on in 2018 and in 2019, and we're seeing those. Plus I think with the markets being stronger, we assume our new business wins linked generally to a more normalized market. So as markets are stronger we're getting a little bit of a tailwind on some of those new business wins as well, that they come in a little bit stronger than what we were originally planning for. George Clark : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Buckingham Research Group. Your line is now open. Neil Frohnapple : Jay, as you mentioned, you have a chance of achieving the M2019 EPS target one year earlier, which is very impressive. But could you just talk about your confidence level in achieving the target next year in FY19, given how strong FY18 is coming in from a global market outlook standpoint? And even if NAFTA Class 8 truck is down in FY19, sort of your ability to still achieve that? Jay Craig : Well, thanks, Neil. That's a good question and obviously something we look at very closely as well. Because like M2016, these aren't point of time targets. This is transformational for the Company and we plan to grow on those achievements. It's a little early to talk about 2019 guidance, but obviously the significant number of new business wins we think will serve as a measurable dampener to any market downturn we see. And also, as Kevin just mentioned, we tend to convert at lower levels during peaks because of bringing on layered capacity and incurring some premiums. So as those markets step down, we could see further expansion of our conversion metrics as we're able to more aggressively manage those stepped-up costs during peak markets. Neil Frohnapple : Okay, that's helpful. And then the incremental environmental reserve of $8 million in the quarter related to a legacy site. You would have delivered a 12.2% EBITDA margin in the quarter if that did not occur. And I know these things can be unpredictable, but do you feel like the $8 million is more one time and there won't be additional cost related to this in the back half of the year? Jay Craig : Again, Neil, we highlighted that. That's one-time cost. It's difficult with some of these sites to say will we ever have another dollar of investment. I wouldn't go that far. But I think the actions that we accrued for that we're in the midst of taking, our very aggressive clean-up of the site, that we think will hopefully put this behind us. And so, we've taken a more aggressive approach towards this particular site to try and put that liability behind us. Neil Frohnapple : Okay. And then one last one. I mean, just given where the stock is trading, can you just talk about the thought process of buying back your own stock versus doing additional bolt-on acquisitions? And you did buy back some shares in the quarter, but just given the increase again in the free cash flow outlook, could you potentially do more buybacks than previously anticipated with the stock trading significantly below intrinsic value? Kevin Nowlan : Absolutely. I mean, we're going to be opportunistic and balanced as it relates to deployment of our capital from here on out through 2019. We anticipate obviously generating more free cash flow over the balance of the year and you can anticipate we'll expect to have strong free cash flow again in 2019. We will look at bolt-on acquisition opportunities that make sense for us and we'll look at continuing to be opportunistic in the market, just as we were in the second quarter repurchasing 1.4 million shares. So we'll be balanced and opportunistic. Neil Frohnapple : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel of Stifel. Your line is now open. Mike Baudendistel : Just wanted to ask you on this all-electric program with Peterbilt, is there more Meritor content on those all-electric trucks versus a similar piece of equipment that are diesel? Jay Craig : At this point in time I would say is fairly neutral. As our eAxle comes online and gets through the prototype stage we'll actually be running one of those on a school bus application by the end of this month. I think the expectation is if that product proves out to be as efficient as we believe it will be, I think we could start to see that eAxle replace some of the components on the vehicle, because it allows for much more battery capacity than the architecture that we're moving forward with on those Peterbilt vehicles right now. Mike Baudendistel : Got it. And then I just also wanted to ask you on this acquired assets of the AA Gear & Manufacturing, does that play into the EV strategy at all? Because I remember from your investor day that part of the additional content on some EVs would be the additional gearing near the wheel end. Is that - does that play into that - the thought process on the acquired assets there? Jay Craig : Very insightful question, Mike, because of one of the capabilities AA Gear brings us is precision ground gears, which we think there'll be increasing demand for in an electric environment. Because those ground gears are quieter in operation and, obviously with the elimination of the noise from the internal combustion engine, the vehicle becomes much more sensitive to other components and the noise they generate. So, we are very excited about that capability as well. But I would say overall it's just clearly right in line with the strategy we laid out for M2019 in our components business. And we like Fabco's acquisition, like the investment in TransPower, hopefully you can see that our acquisitions are very logical and connected to our strategy. Mike Baudendistel : Got it. Makes sense. And then just wanted to ask you one last one on China. You increased the guidance there and I think a lot have with sort of the fast start to China. Does it also include a thought that the Chinese market is going to slow down in the back half of the year? Or is it because it's less relevant to you because you do more off-highway in China? Jay Craig : I would say it's somewhat less relevant to us because we're more heavily weighted towards the off-highway. Mike Baudendistel : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Your line is now open. Steven Hempel : This is Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson. Just wanted to drill down a little bit on the long-term comp structure as part of the M2022 plans, longer-term comp plans here. Obviously the 2017 plan was focused really on EBITDA margins, which you guys did a great job of achieving. 2018 plan shifted more towards EPS and then the 2019 plan added an above market growth aspect to it, as well as leverage. Just thinking about kind of where we're at from a cycle perspective and where your margins are at currently, and then obviously the shift to electrified products and eAxles, how we should be thinking about the comp structure at a high level. I understand you can't disclose what they will be, but just strategically as we think about where we're at from a cycle perspective, what additional potential metrics might you be looking at? ROIC, free cash flow, et cetera, above market growth? I'll leave it at that. Jay Craig : Sure. Well, first of all, I think our long-term comp structure is very clear in its alignment to the strategies, as you just articulated. Senior executive management gets compensated on hitting those three financial targets embedded in M2019, as we did on the M2016. As we spoke in the previous quarter, we're in the midst of developing the M2022 strategy and we expect to roll that out at an Analyst Day this December. And we will once again that strategy will result in defined financial metrics that we will set for the Company over that three-year period. And then our long-term incentive plans will then again be locked into those achievement of those metrics. Now, to determine those metrics, we're doing a lot of research. We've done a very detailed shareholder survey over the last few months, both on the buy side and sell side, and we're taking all of that input to develop what those metrics will be, that we're hearing will drive the most significant return on shareholder value. So, we're a little early to talk about specifically what they'll be, but just know that the input you've given is being heard, filtered down, and then we'll develop those metrics. Steven Hempel : Good. That's great to hear. I believe that's fairly thorough relative to some other companies in our coverage particularly. But anyhow - so just want to shift gears here over to the PACCAR EV tests here. Obviously good to see some progress there and some announcements on that front. Is PACCAR working with other Tier 1 suppliers for these eAxles and electrified products? Or is Meritor going to be the exclusive supplier there moving forward? Jay Craig : I think like all OEs, they have some projects with different customers. I know they have one particular project, I believe it's with Cummins and their system. I think the announcement we made today is certainly one on the largest block orders, if not the largest. But as you would expect in a rapidly evolving market right now, like I would do if I were running an OE, they are placing their bets with different providers right now. But I think clearly Meritor has established itself as one of the leaders in the future of that technology, which is our goal. And for example, we were asked to present - I was asked to present just Tuesday as the keynote speaker at the ACT Expo. No great complement to my great speaking skills, but more about how Meritor has been recognized as a thought leader in electrification, and they wanted to hear what Meritor's plans are for the future. Steven Hempel : Okay. And then just to follow on that, how should we be thinking about the North American and EU European bus market? Obviously you look at China, that's - from an electrified standpoint, that's been the first market to move over to eAxles. Just wondering how quickly we can start seeing some announcements on the North American/European bus market. Jay Craig : As I've stated previously, I think that's one of the markets globally you're going to see move the quickest and most aggressively. There were some very interesting applications out at ACT Expo this week, even on the airport shuttle vans and buses, moving fully electric. I think that the requirements on cities to meet clean-air requirements are going to drive the bus sector much more quickly potentially than any other sector. Steven Hempel : Okay, so safe to assume that Meritor is - there's projects and whatnot in the pipeline? Jay Craig : Yes. I feel very pleased with where we are positioned in our pipeline on different bus projects throughout the globe. Steven Hempel : Got it. And just really quickly on the ramp up on RD&E here to support new business, particularly around electrification. I believe the expectation for 2018 here was roughly half of the $12 million increase was due to increased R&D, so to speak. How should we be thinking about that ramp into 2019 and beyond? Kevin Nowlan : I think it's premature at the moment to comment on 2019, but I would say as you look first half to second half, there is a little bit of an incremental step up in the electrification investment that's embedded within our guidance. Steven Hempel : Got it. And if I could just squeeze in one quick one. AA Gear & Manufacturing acquisition, Cat and CNH, like those two customers, obviously. Were those customers previously for Meritor? And I guess strategically this acquisition kind of, did this get you kind of above market growth, so to speak, more quickly, getting to the extent that Cat and CNH wasn't a customer to Meritor? Jay Craig : Well, I think to answer the second half of your question, yes. We believe so, that this will work towards getting us the above market growth. Caterpillar and CNH were small customers of ours in components, but this significantly expands our penetration. Obviously IVECO is a subsidiary of CNH, and we supply all the single reduction truck axles for them in Europe. But this moves us aggressively into the construction, ag, off-highway space for components. Steven Hempel : Got it, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Carl Anderson : Thank you, Takeeya. This does conclude our Meritor second-quarter earnings call and we thank you for your participation. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks Carl. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 3 for the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 23% to more than $1.1 billion driven by higher production in all of our major markets, new business wins, and market share increases. In fact, we believe our market share in rear axles during the past two quarters in North America is the highest in our history. In addition, we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 80 basis points to 12% which is also among the best on record for Meritor, and we generated $102 million in free cash flow in the quarter. We are raising our full-year guidance across the board driven by our excellent performance year-to-date, higher volumes around the world, and sustain strong conversion. Kevin will walk you through the detail later in the call. With the updated outlook for fiscal 2018, we're excited to tell you that we are on track to achieve two of our three M2019 targets, a full year earlier than planned. These are net debt to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. As you know, the financial metrics we established for M2019 were aggressive targets, so achieving them a year early is a significant accomplishment. Remember, our EPS target of $2.84 was an 80% improvement from our jump-off point in fiscal year 2015. We are proud of our employees and leadership team around the world for the focus and alignment they've shown. This was demonstrated to a great degree over the past year as we have successfully met our customers' production requirements while maintaining world-class levels of quality and delivery seen by few in the industry. In the third quarter, our higher absolute earnings and free cash flow generation combined with our balanced approach to capital allocation have enabled us to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA target, and we did that while buying back an additional 1.4 million common shares. Since 2015, we have bought back more than 15 million common shares. On a go-forward basis through the balance of our M2019 strategy, we expect to continue to deploy capital in support of both strategic growth initiatives, including M&A and opportunistic share buybacks. Let's now look at slide 4 for a regional update. While North America is certainly our largest market, we want to keep you updated on the meaningful growth we're seeing in other areas of the world as the leading provider of drivetrain and breaking components to the commercial vehicle industry. In the past quarters, we've given you highlights on South America and China; today, we wanted to give you a more detailed look at our growing India business. First of all, you'll note that we've raised our production outlook again for India by approximately 30% year-over-year, and now expect to be in the range of 410,000 to 420,000 medium and heavy-duty units. If you've been following the economy in India, you know that GDP is strong and expected to get stronger next year. Increased infrastructure investment is having a favorable impact on the commercial vehicle industry. Meritorious volumes of on- and off-highway axles as well as military axles and brakes are significantly higher this year due to the surge in the industry and our expansion of business with major players and including Ashok Leyland, Tata, Volvo Eicher and Mahindra in the heavy-duty and medium-duty segments for a variety of applications. As we look ahead to next year, certain policy actions are also expected to continue to drive strong demand in India. These actions include mandatory scrapping of trucks that are more than 20-years-old which should trigger replacement purchases, in addition to the upcoming Euro 6 emission standard which we expect will create a pre-buy ahead of the regulation which takes effect in April of 2020. Through our Automotive Axles Limited joint venture with the Kalyani Group, we are investing approximately $20 million in the Mysore facility to add capacity for axle and brake production as we expect sustained growth for the foreseeable future. This joint venture is nearing its 40th year and continues to be an excellent partnership for us as we grow in this region. If you turn to slide 5, I'll highlight some of the great new business wins. First, we have a couple of exciting new awards in Europe. We've talked previously about our hub reduction platform for which we have a common design and standard production system around the globe. This has enabled us to successfully localize the product in every region of the world. We will be manufacturing our MT-32-610 hub reduction axle for construction and mining trucks for a major customer in Europe. And in Turkey, we have two new programs with BMC for construction and linehaul applications. Meritor will supply BMC with hub reduction axles as well as our 18X. In defense, we have a major content on the new heavy dump truck program for Mack Defense. For this we will supply rear beam and front steer axles as well as drivelines and transfer cases amounting to tens of thousands of dollars of content per vehicle. The initial contract award is for approximately 700 trucks. In addition to this business, we continue to opportunistically pursue and win other military programs. We anticipate these will provide an incremental revenue stream in the coming years. As we look at our position in commercial vehicle electrification, we recently earned new business with Ashok Leyland in India in addition to a program with a major OE that will use Meritor's e-axles in 14 of its electric trucks. Two of those vehicles will be completely equipped with content from TransPower through our strategic relationship. We are also working with Thomas Built Bus, a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America on the development of a battery electric powertrain solution for its school bus platform. Our first prototype has been on the road in California since April. This is the first commercial vehicle with a fully-functional Meritor 14X e-axle, coupled with TransPower technology. In June, we announced the appointment of John Bennett to a new position at Meritor as Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. We believe this will be a crucial role as we grow in the commercial vehicle electric space, whether through the evolution of existing products like our 14X axle for which we are redesigning gears and downsizing brakes, or through the development of all new products like the e-axle. We are taking the appropriate actions to remain a market leader and we will greatly benefit from John's expertise. One additional opportunity I wanted to tell you about is a significant award for our components business. This is a five-year contract (00:10:07) and one of the largest wins we've received since officially launching this business. Over the life of the contract, we expected to produce more than 3 million pieces and we expect production to start in early 2020. Now, let's turn to side 6. We wanted to acknowledge our global team today for recognition by several customers for outstanding performance in quality, delivery, customer service, field support, and new product development. These awards are always important to us but earning them in this timeframe is particularly meaningful considering the high demand requirements we've been successfully managing for many quarters, as I said earlier in the call. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the financials and then we'll open it up for your questions. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our third quarter financial results and our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. As you heard from Jay, we had a very strong quarter of financial performance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12%, saw revenue increase to over $1.1 billion, and generated over $100 million of free cash flow. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 7 where you'll see our third quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were almost $1.13 billion in the quarter driven by a combination of higher production in all major markets and continuing revenue outperformance. In North America, Class 8 truck production was 79,000, up 13,000 trucks from a year ago. We expect production levels will step up further in the fourth quarter as our order board remains at high levels. Sales in Europe were also up in our third quarter driven by increased volumes. As Jay has highlighted over the last several quarters, we are seeing year-over-year growth in our other international markets. In fact, we saw about $40 million of the sales growth in the quarter come from our businesses in Brazil, China, and India. In addition to strong end markets, revenue outperformance achieved primarily through market share increases and new business wins continues to supplement our sales growth and accounted for approximately $50 million of the increase in sales from last year. Driven primarily by higher revenue, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $135 million and increased adjusted EBITDA margin by 80 basis points compared to last year. As you can see from the chart on the right side of the slide, we converted on incremental revenue at just over 15% on an all-in basis, consistent with our expectations for this market environment. As we've discussed before, we have two items that will continue to impact year-over-year performance through the balance of this fiscal year. These include $8 million in lower equity earnings and affiliates resulting from the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO JV at the end of last year and $10 million in lower OPEB expense resulting from the modifications we made to our U.S. retiree healthcare benefits in September. Noticeably absent in our causal is the impact of tariffs and escalating steel costs on our financials. Let me speak briefly about each of these. In the case of steel tariffs implemented to-date, we import very little raw steel into the U.S. from abroad. As a result, the impact of steel tariffs on us has been de minimis thus far in 2018, but of course the landscape is changing frequently so we'll continue to monitor the situation including the potential late-August imposition of the new Section 301 tariffs on a broader set of imports from China. In this environment of strong market demand and escalating trade rhetoric, we have seen domestic steel prices increasing fairly significantly. In fact, the Hot-Rolled Coil Index has increased 44% since last year, inclusive of an 18% increase sequentially. The result has been an escalation in our steel costs. However this escalation has been mitigated by our recovery mechanisms which have been offsetting prior increases in steel indices thereby negating the year-over-year impact on our financials. In fact, on a year-over-year basis steel was a slight positive for us in Q3. Moving to the left side of the chart, you can see that we expanded gross margin by 30 basis points to 15.7% driven by conversion on incremental revenue and lower pension and retiree medical expense. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $80 million, or $0.89 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, a 39% increase over last year. And finally, we generated $102 million of free cash flow this quarter. In addition to higher operating earnings, we also benefited from lower retiree medical benefit payments and reduced cash interest due to the deleveraging actions we have executed over the last 12 months. Let's move to slide 8 which details our third quarter sales and EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Trailer segment, sales increased by 24% to $904 million. While the increase in revenue was driven primarily by higher market production in North America, we also saw increases in every other major market in which we operate. In addition, we saw continued benefits from new business wins and market share increases. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $103 million, up $32 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Trailer came in at 11.4%, a 160-basis-point increase over last year. The increases in both EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and the favorable impact of changes to retiree medical benefits, partially offset by lower affiliate earnings from the joint venture divestiture in the previous year. In our Aftermarket & Industrial segment, sales were $273 million, up 15% from last year. The increase was driven by higher volumes across our North America Aftermarket business and higher sales in our Industrial business which included revenue from the business we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $35 million, up $5 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.8% compared to 12.7% last year. The increases in both EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by the favorable impact of changes to retiree medical benefits and conversion on higher sales, partially offset by higher material and freight costs. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2018 global market outlook on slide 9. The North America truck market is showing no signs of slowing down in the near-term with Class 8 net orders over 40,000 units for four of the last six months and a backlog-to-build ratio of approximately eight months. We are maintaining our outlook for Class 8 and Class 5-7 production at 300,000 units to 310,000 units and 240,000 units to 250000 units, respectively. Trailer volumes have continued to show considerable strength during this fiscal year driven by more drop and hook activity due to driver shortages and the ELD implementation, as well as more frequent lighter loads resulting from increased e-commerce activity. We are increasing our estimate by 20,000 to 310,000 to 320,000 units in 2018. Europe remains at strong production levels and South America continues to recover. We've increased our outlook for Europe by 5,000 units and maintained our previous outlook for South America. As we've discussed on this call, the India market continues to expand. We have increased our 2018 outlook there by 12% to 410,000 to 420,000. This would be the first year that this market has exceeded 400,000 trucks. And finally, our revenue expectation for our business in China has increased by 8% to approximately $210 million to $220 million. Overall, end markets across the globe along with revenue outperformance are driving the strong top line growth this year. And importantly, we are successfully converting on this revenue opportunity. Based on these market assumptions, you can see on slide 10 that we are again raising our 2018 guidance. We are now forecasting revenue to be approximately $4.1 billion on the high end of our prior guidance. We're now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 11.3%, a 10-basis-point increase from our prior outlook. We are also raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $2.90 to $3 per share. Just to reiterate what Jay said earlier, we're excited that we are on track to achieve two of our three M2019 targets one year early inclusive of our adjusted EPS target. And finally based on our higher earnings expectations, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to be in a range of $135 million to $145 million. This cash flow guidance includes an approximately $60 million investment in working capital this year to support revenue growth. We would expect any incremental investment in working capital to subside as revenue level stabilize. As a result, we see the $135 million to $145 million in free cash flow in FY 2018 as the starting point from which we expect future growth in cash flow looking to FY 2019 and beyond. We are very pleased with our performance so far in 2018 as we continue to execute on our M2019 commitments. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator : Our first question is from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open. Gene Vladimirov - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Gene Vladimirov on for Colin. Would you be able to give us some color on your Aftermarket margin outlook for the rest of the year? And then when you think about the segment, what sort of timeframe should we be thinking about in terms of getting to that 14% target margin? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: With respect to Aftermarket & Industrial, we haven't simply revised the segments here. Last quarter, we haven't given a new guidance outlook in terms of what we expect the long-term run rate for that business to be. I think we're pretty pleased with the performance on a year-over-year basis. We saw margins up a little bit on a year-over-year basis, and we're continuing to progress as we look to Q4. We have been taking actions to make sure we improve the margin of the underlying Aftermarket business which is the majority of that business, inclusive of executing some pricing actions here on July 1st which should flow through in our fourth quarter results. Gene Vladimirov - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Helpful. And then with North America truck kind of at peak levels, just wondering how you're thinking about growth opportunities for next year? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think you should keep in mind of the $800 million of revenue growth year-over-year that about 25% of that is new business wins. So it's not just market growth and as I spoke to you on the call today, we continue to have meaningful new business wins in all our focused areas of growth, be it defense, off-highway, components, internationally, and Europe. A lot of our new product introductions in China are starting to take hold in the mid-market segment. So, we still feel we have a lot of headroom for growth in the areas we targeted as part of the M2019 program. Gene Vladimirov - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. Good luck for the rest of the year. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Faheem F. Sabeiha - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats on a good quarter. Just wondering if you can provide a little more color around the increased market share in the quarter, were they share gains in the heavy-duty and medium-duty markets, or do they have anything to do with the industry supply constraints that allowed Meritor to achieve higher share? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: We certainly have been successful in meeting the demands of the market. We think we're \u2013 as I mentioned, we're among the best in the industry at that. And if you go back to some comments I've made in previous quarters, that's really no accident. We've proactively built inventory banks in critical component areas. We've invested in our manufacturing capabilities to respond to what we expected to be increased market share from our new business wins. So, we have reached what we believe is the highest market penetration we've ever had in North America, and are very pleased with that performance so far. Faheem F. Sabeiha - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then regarding your components business, it felt like the focus with components was to drive a higher off-highway business, but you guys won business on a light-vehicle platform. So is the light-vehicle market the direction for this business? I mean, could we see more wins in the space, and do you have to make additional investments in the business to meet light-vehicle volume levels? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: No, the primary focus is not on the light-vehicle side, but as you know, the crossover between medium-duty trucks and then into some of what are classified as light-duty vehicles, there is some crossover on those components. So, we did target this particular market where we achieved a significant win this quarter when we set the strategy for the business, and it was a very intentional product development and focused sales effort on this particular segment. Faheem F. Sabeiha - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : Our next question is from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess starting on the revenue guidance, so you called off NAFTA commercial vehicle production schedules implies a sequential increase from the FY third quarter, and I realize there are some summer shutdowns in Europe, U.S. dollar strengthened a bit, but curious on any other drivers and why the implied sales outlook for the fourth quarter is $125 million lower than Q3. And I can appreciate, you're being conservative in light of some of the supplier constraints and trade noise, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something there. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. Neil, this is Kevin. A few things. One is, as you alluded to we typically have the seasonal shutdowns in Europe which is probably the biggest driver of the revenue step-down we expect sequentially in Q4. But keep in mind that some of our other businesses typically hit seasonal peaks coming out of the third fiscal quarter, that includes Aftermarket, China, India, Trailer which all typically take a step down in Q4. And then on top of that, we're going to see currency become a little bit of a headwind sequentially as we look at what's happened with the euro heading into the fourth quarter. So, all those things are contributors to the step down in revenue in Q4. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And could you just talk more about the industry supply constraints that occurred this past quarter; any notable impact to results you would call out? And then, more importantly, how Meritor is managing any headwinds. I'm just curious if these are improving. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: We have not had supply constraints that resulted in us missing critical deliveries to our customers, so we have not incurred those. I wouldn't say that is without some Herculean efforts and at times some typical actions you see in an upturn like this expedited freight and things of that nature, but so far we have been able to deliver on our commitments to our customers even at these very high levels. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. And then if I could just sneak one more in. So the new business wins, Jay, continue to come through for you. You called out several in the presentation. So is the $260 million of incremental revenue from new business wins that's expected to hit the P&L in FY 2019 on a year-over-year basis, is that still a good number to think about irrespective of volume changes and the underlying end markets for next year? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: We're not ready to update our guidance for 2019 as of yet, but we're still confident in the level of new business wins that we're driving and you can see and as Jay mentioned a good chunk, 25% or so, of our revenue increases this year are related to the revenue outperformance and we would expect that to continue the trajectory that we're on heading into 2019. But we'll provide more of an update on that when we give our 2019 outlook in November. Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. George Clark - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. This is George Clark on for Joe. Just a quick question on your incremental margin assumption in the fourth quarter, it looks like it's around 12%, but you guys have been executing around 15% over the past three quarters. So, can you just give us some color on what the drivers are for that, kind of, lower outlook? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. I mean the biggest driver of that is really that we have incremental steel headwinds as we go from Q3 to Q4. We've seen, as I mentioned in my remarks, certain steel indices even going up 18% sequentially from Q3 to Q4 and that's going to continue to hit us or start to hit us from a cost perspective in Q4 and we won't see the recovery benefit of that until we get into 2019. So, when you adjust for that call it about $4 million of headwind in Q4 sequentially then that puts us into our typical conversion on downside revenue driven by the revenue step-down we just talked about in response to Neil's question with Europe, China, India, and some of the other markets stepping down. George Clark - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then kind of off of that steel comment, into 2019 as you guys start to see the recoveries from this year, could that be a little bit of a tailwind from a margin standpoint, if steel prices kind of start to level off a little bit? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I think it's hard to say at this point, and I don't think we're prepared to give a 2019 outlook yet. There's been so much volatility in steel prices and with the trade rhetoric that I think we need to see where things are going to settle down over the next few months before we can really give an outlook there. We do, of course, have those recovery mechanisms in place that tend to be on about a six-month lag. So, if steel prices were to level off at a particular level or steel indices were to level off, we would start to see the recovery benefit on that about six months later, but we'll give more fulsome guidance in the November call. George Clark - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Great quarter. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Your line is now open. Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Just wanted to ask you, I mean, so much of the investor discussion has been around the Class 8 market peaking, and just wanted to get your perspective now that so much of the revenue development opportunities have been in international markets, and off-highway markets and medium-duty and defense, et cetera, what portion of your revenue now is tied to the Class 8 tractor market that is so highly volatile? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, we haven't disclosed that in the past, but I can tell you as we look forward to our future business plans, we think we can sustain a reasonable step-down in Class 8 production while holding revenue relatively flat because of all the significant new business wins that we've achieved, as you noted, outside the North American Class 8 market. And I think this quarter was just a great example of all those significant wins that are really around our diversified business. Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's good. Just also want to ask you, just on the adjusted EBITDA margins now at record levels, over 12%, can you just walk us through a little bit about how much of that was a function of the higher volumes this year and operating leverage and how much of that is going to be sustainable if we were to go to, say, a mid-cycle type level where North American production is 220,000 to 240,000 instead of 310,000? Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, as we look at jumping from last year's 10.4% margin for the full year to this year's 11.3% margin, we've obviously seen a significant uptick in revenue, about $750 million in our guidance on a year-over-year basis, and we've been converting on that at around 15%. And so, that's \u2013 there are some other puts and takes in there, but that by and large has been the driver to-date. But remember we were jumping off at 10.4% last year and expecting to continue to improve even with revenues not being as strong coming into the year. So, we continue to expect as we look ahead to be able to deliver material labor and burden performance in environments where the markets becomes \u2013 returns to more normalized levels. I think when we talk about our outlook for 2019 as well as our strategy for what's next at our December Analyst Day which we're targeting you'll hear us talk about what our expectations are for those margins over the cycle, but I think your expectation should be that this is not \u2013 11.3% for 2018 is not the peak for our business. Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then I think I missed earlier, the recovery on your steel prices, how long is the lag or when do you actually recover it from the higher prices, is it in a couple quarters or... Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: It's normally a couple of quarters, six to nine months lag from the time the indices start impacting us from a cost perspective. They tend to lag then in terms of customer recoveries on go-forward pricing about six to nine months. Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's all I had. Congrats on meeting that multi-year EPS target. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah. Hi, guys. You mentioned the euro there briefly. Was wondering if you could comment, I guess, also on forex volatility elsewhere, obviously you've got some pretty severe currency movements in South America, the RMB has been moving in China; just wondering if you can update us generally on the extent to which that'll end up having any translational/transactional impacts on your earnings and revenue. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I mean, they had some impact in the quarter, for instance, if I look year-over-year, we did see a little bit of favorability, single-digit millions of dollars from a revenue perspective related to the euro primarily. But as we look ahead as I mentioned we see what the euro has done here the last month or so, it has strengthened which will create a little bit of a headwind sequentially. But all in, the biggest driver of the movements that we're seeing in revenue right now are by and far end markets as well as our revenue outperformance. And at the end of the day, currencies aren't that significant an impact as we look at earnings both Q3 and Q4. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. I noticed you took up the China revenue guidance again really nicely. Can you comment on how much of that was off-highway versus maybe some on-highway revenues starting to creep in? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think it's a mix of both. As I mentioned on the call, we are seeing penetration of the new products that we've developed and introduced into the Chinese on-highway market really take hold. And as we spoke to you previously, we also export to other areas in Asia. The products that we produce in China because of the quality levels that we produce them out we're able to export them into other Asian markets. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Great. And then last one, you mentioned expedited freight supply chain constraints, doesn't sound like that's impacting the OE side of the business at all, but perhaps you're seeing that maybe more so in the Aftermarket segment, was I reading that correctly? Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think that is correct. And as Kevin mentioned in response to a previous question, we have executed some price increases here in Aftermarket to compensate for the increased freight costs we're seeing, the increased material costs. We do not have, for the most part, automatic pass-through mechanisms that we have on the OE side in our Aftermarket business, but we have pushed through these pricing increases recently which is part of our expectation why we continue to expect to see improvement in the margin of the Aftermarket business as the year goes on. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Carl Anderson for any further remarks. Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. This does conclude Meritor's Third Quarter Conference Call, and we thank you for your continued participation. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Jeffrey Craig : Thanks, Carl. And good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for a look at our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.  Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3. Let me start by saying we had another great quarter delivering on our financial and customer commitments and by all measures we also had an extraordinary year. For this, I want to recognize the Meritor team around the world. Our employees are doing a fantastic job driving excellent results in all areas of the company, particularly as we manage the challenges inherent to supporting strong markets and the volatility of material costs around the globe. The year is notable not only for financial results however, we did much more. We launched six new products for specialty linehaul, bus and coach and off-highway applications. We\u2019ve positioned Meritor to be a leader in electric drivetrains and as part of that strategy we launched our Blue Horizon Advanced Technology brand. We successfully integrated two bolt-on acquisitions, each of which has contributed toward our revenue target for M2019. We\u2019ve managed our business in Brazil through the severe downturn over the past several years and are happy to see volumes up almost 40% this past year as we launched new business with MAN, Mercedes Benz and Iveco. And as we remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, we bought back 4.5 million shares of common stock in fiscal '18 and are pleased to announce today that we plan to repurchase more. In 2015, we have -- since 2015 we have repurchased more than 17 million shares and significantly reduced the amount of convertible debt that was previously dilutive. In addition, we achieved our long-term leverage target of 1.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA.  Overall, these actions reflect the level of performance you've come to expect from Meritor. Turning to our results in the quarter, we generated revenue of almost $1.1 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. In addition to higher production on all our major markets, we continue to grow share and win new business, driving the step-up in revenue. We also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 30 basis points and adjusted earnings per share by 32%.  In a few minutes, Kevin will walk you through our full year guidance for fiscal 2019. You'll note that we anticipate it to be another strong year for Meritor. A key message you will hear from us going forward is related to the free cash flow generation capability we now have in place due to deleveraging, legacy liability reduction and operating performance.  On that note, let's go to Slide 4. Over the past several years, Meritor's financial performance has significantly improved and our balance sheet is now in a great place. In fact, we received a credit upgrade last month from Moody's and have achieved our target leverage one year earlier than planned. We plan to generate strong free cash flow in 2019, and expect it to continue even with normal cyclicality that is characteristic of our industry. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we completed the execution of our $100 million repurchase program by buying back 4.5 million shares in 2018.  With that now complete, we are pleased to announce a new board authorized share repurchase program which is double the size of the prior program. We believe we are now in an excellent position to accelerate aggressive capital return to our shareholders, particularly in the form of increased share buybacks. We intend to share more around our capital allocation plans at our Analyst Day in December.  Let's go to Slide 5. We are now less than a year from completing our M2019 plan. As you look at this slide, the left column shows the three financial targets we\u2019ve set for the company. You can see our status for each of the metrics and the contribution made towards each target in fiscal 2018. We realized $325 million of revenue outperformance during the year, driven by new business wins, increased market share and additional revenues from two bolt-on acquisitions. And we are on track to achieve $660 million for M2019 consistent with what we told you at Analyst Day last year. In fiscal 2019, we will continue to evaluate strategic bolt-on acquisition opportunities to further accelerate our revenue growth. Also this year, we generated $474 million of adjusted EBITDA and achieved solid conversion in elevated markets with a challenging industry operating environment. Our M2019 goal was to increase adjusted EPS by a $1.25 which was an 80% improvement from our jump up point in fiscal year 2015. We have achieved our M2019 adjusted EPS target a full year early.  With regard to capital allocation, we said we would reduce our leverage to less than 1.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. As I just mentioned, we achieved that in fiscal 2018. We also said we would return 25% of free cash flow to shareholders. Since the launch of M2019 we have returned roughly double that amount. Overall, the bottom-line earnings of the company has dramatically improved over the past several years and our ability to generate significant free cash flow has never been stronger.  On Slide 6, we wanted to give you a few highlights from 2018 as we noted for revenue gains were driven by higher production in all our major markets. In combination with revenue outperformance through increased market share and new business wins. Top-line increases in South America, China and India as noted here and speak to with the first vacation of our business. You'll see later in the presentation that we expect this trend to continue as production volumes remain robust in these regions.  Also on this slide you'll note that we continue to maintain our operational excellence even as daily rear axle production in North America increased 20% during the cycle. With our markets have slightly lower levels in 2018 than during the last peak market in 2015 it is clear that we have driven market share growth over the past few years that is being realized in our bottom line results. In fact, we believe we are now operating at our highest North American axle production level in our history. That level of production requires a tremendous effort across the company but we manage delivery commitments exceptionally well throughout the year. And in order to continue our track record of supporting our customers' needs and delivering in this market environment, we are now making some very modest capacity investments in our supply base. We believe that will allow us to sustain our shares as markets remains strong in 2019.  Finally we wanted to highlight just a few of our business wins this year with some of the largest commercial vehicle manufacturers in the world. We have new business in every region across most of our applications with products like our dual light package in China, the hub reduction axle for DAF in Europe. Our new suspension business with Ashok Leyland in India and the optimized air disc brake that is standard on freight liners new Cascadian model and a preview to our new single piston disc brake we plan to launch next year.  We have a technology and product portfolio that is consistently evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers. Our aggressive new product lifecycle is the primary reason for our market share gains and we plan to keep the pedal to the metal in this area for the foreseeable future.  On Slide 7, you will see some of the investment we made this year to increase our capability and improve our portfolio and our off-highway business, we are winning new business globally. You'll remember when we launched M2019 we talked about growing our off -highway business and we really see that taking shape.  As I just mentioned we're excited about the launch of our new single piston air disc brake, disc brake is already in test on several trucks and we believe that it will allow us to grow our position as the market trends towards air disc brakes in North America and other regions. We have talked throughout the year about our position in electrification. We are now involved in 22 different electric programs with many of the world's leading global commercial vehicle manufacturers and expect to have at least 130 fully electric medium and heavy duty commercial trucks on the road by the end of 2020. Also in 2020, we intend to be production ready with Meritor\u2019s 14X e-axle. Electric drive trains are an exciting area that we believe will grow in the short term particularly in bus [indiscernible] and pickup in delivery applications. With our own e-axle and the full systems solutions, we can offer through our strategic investment and transpower. We believe we have already established Maritor, as a leader in this area. That we plan to invest and grow appropriately to remain in that position as market adoption occurs.  Now I turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the financials and then we'll open it up for questions. Kevin Nowlan : Thanks Jay and good morning. On today's call I'll review our full year financial results and then I'll provide you with an overview of our 2019 guidance. Overall we had an outstanding year of financial performance. We drove revenue growth of 25%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 90 basis points, increase adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 61% to $3.03 and generated $147 million of free cash flow.  Let's turn to Slide 8, we\u2019ll see our full year financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were up $831 million from last year on higher production in all of our major markets and continued revenue outperformance. Starting with end markets, in North America Class 8 truck production was 38,000 units up 30% from the prior year. Sales in Europe were also higher, driven by continued strength in the heavy and medium duty truck market.  As Jay highlighted our operations in Brazil, China and India are providing additional tailwind to our sales as those regions made up about $180 million of the year over year sales increase. Revenue outperformance achieved primarily through market share increases in new business wins supplemented our sales growth and accounted for approximately $325 million or nearly 40% of the increase in sales from last year. On the right side of the slide, you can see in the line item volume, mix, performance and other we have $114 million of higher adjusted EBITDA on the $831 million revenue increase. That translates the net underlying conversion of approximately 14% which we view as a good result in market 5Bs but is particularly strong when you consider some of the headwinds we faced in 2018. For example, steel cost were significantly higher during the year much of this increase came from strong market demand and trade tensions. Although increases in steel industries drove our cost sub year-over-year, these costs were up almost completely offset by the recovery mechanisms we have in place resulting in an insignificant to our financials. We also saw higher freight and layer capacity cost in addition to other inefficiencies that are inherent when you operate the market at these levels. We were able to substantially these address these costs through performance and pricing actions. In the end, all of these cost are embedded in the volume mix performance and other line which is why we are pleased with the conversion.  Next, you\u2019ll see several items that impacted year-over-year performance which we have previously discussed during the year. These include $27 million in lower equity earnings and affiliates resulting from the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO JV at the end of last year. $39 million in lower in lower OPEB expense resulting from the modifications we made to our US retiree healthcare benefits in the prior year. $9 million in environmental reserves related to a legacy site and $10 million from a onetime legal charge for a settlement in 2017. These items provide the walk to our adjusted EBITDA of $474 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%.  In the table on the left, you can see that our operating performance coupled with reduced interest expense from the debt reduction actions we took earlier this year drilled an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations to $276 million or $3.03 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. Finally, we generated $147 million of free cash flow up from $81 million in the prior year. Higher bottom line earnings combined with lower retiree medical benefit payments and reduce cash interest to drove the increase. These contributors were partially offset by increase investment in working capital needed to support the revenue growth.  Slide nine details full year sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck and trailer segment sales increased by 28% from last year to $3.3 billion, driven by higher production in all major markets, market share increases and new business wins. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $345 million up from 47% from last year, segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck and trailer increase 140 basis points. The increases in both segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin were driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue. In our aftermarket and industrial segment, sales were $1 billion up over $100 million from last year driven by higher volumes in our industrial business and revenue from the acquisition we\u2019ve made in the fourth quarter of 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $142 million up $26 million compared to last year, segment adjusted EBITDA margin also increased up 100 basis points compared to last year. The increases in both segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin were driven primarily by lower retiree medical expense and conversion on higher sales. These increases were partially offset by higher material and freight cost primarily in the aftermarket business. Turning to Slide 10, I want to provide an update on our investors liability. During the fourth quarter, we updated our annual evaluations related to the estimate of pending and future as best as related claims. In prior years, we have used a 10 year horizon for estimating future costs, because neither we nor our valuation advisors believe that future probable expenditures beyond 10 years to be reasonably estimated.  As we reassess our valuation this year, we determine that a longer term horizon estimate is now both probable and reasonable, based on our history and experience managing as best as related litigation, diminish volatility and consistency in our observable claims data, and the maturity of as best as litigation overall, among other factors. As a result, working with our specialist, we move to a penultimate horizon for estimating claims, which means that we are now estimating the potential cost of as best as defensive indemnity claims through the year 2059. While they're changing horizon estimate lead to an increase in our as best as related claims liability, we also recognize additional anticipated insurance recoveries that will mitigate a portion of the costs related to those as best as claims. The impact of moving to the longer horizon estimate of the liability, net of insurance coverage receivables was a onetime $56 million non-cash charge. The next bullet on page shows the impact of a new settlement agreement that we reached in Q4, with an insurer to resolve previously disputed coverage of claims. Over the past several years, we've been aggressively pursuing strategy to settle disputed insurance claims and have now settled all of the major outstanding disputes.  Pursuant to the terms on this new agreement, we receive $3 million in cash from the ensure and recorded at $28 million receivable that is expected to offset future claims resulting in $31 million of income that helped offset the projected time horizon change.  The net impact of these asbestos items was a $25 million charge, which was excluded from our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The chart on the right hand side of the slide shows the incoming cash impacts from expenses related items. You were called it in 2016, we reached a settlement agreements with several insurance which resulted in meaningful cash and income recognition. As you can see in our forecast for 2019, all of the settlement agreements are expected to mitigate the likely income statement and cash flow impact associated with feature as best as costs. Next I'll review our fiscal year 2019 market outlook on Slide 11. We\u2019ve seen strong net orders for most of 2018 in North America Class A truck, with the backlog to build ratio now at 9 months. We believe elevated build levels will continue through our fiscal year, resulting in production of about 320,000 units.  As we look to our other markets, we anticipate that Europe will be relatively stable in 2019 at approximately 485,000 trucks. The economy is forecast to continue to grow and the solid fundamentals support a strong truck production market. Moving to Asia, we expect our sales in China to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar. And the India should produce about 450,000 trucks slightly higher than the record levels we saw in 2018. Finally, we forecast South America production will expand to around 110,000 units. In Brazil, business confidence is improved and we are hopeful the new government will bring stability and continued growth to the economy.  On Slide 12, I'll review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2019. Our forecast is for sales to be approximately $4.25 billion up slightly from 2018. The callout box on the right walks to this revenue figure from our 2018 actuals. As you can see our market outlook is up $50 million with North America Class A production providing the largest year-over-year growth. However, we are also seeing headwinds from FX driven by the appreciation of the US dollars against most major currencies which we estimate to be approximately $100 million.  Our guidance also includes revenue outperformance of what $120 million to $150 million driven primarily by new business wins ramping up or coming online. As Jay mentioned this puts us on the path to achieving $660 million in revenue outperformance for M2019. Moving back to the table on the left, we also forecasted our adjusted EBITDA margin will increase 20 basis points to approximately 11.5% which is what we guided to when we first launched the M2019 plan and again at our Analyst Day last December. We expect margin expansion from conversion on higher revenue and operational performance initiatives partially offset by modest increases in net deal cost.  Building on our strong adjusted diluted earnings per share performance in 2018. We anticipate 2019 to be approximately $3.10. Walking from our 2018 adjusted EPS of $3.03 Increased adjusted EBITDA should yield about $0.15 partially offset by higher adjusted tax expense of $0.11 per share. This reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of around 15% which is up a bit from last year but consistent with the longer term guidance we've previously provided.  Finally, we expect to generate $175 million to $185 million of free cash flow. In 2018, we invested a significant amount of cash in working capital to support $131 million in growth we experienced globally. As revenue growth moderates in 2019, that should reduce the amount of incremental working capital investment, which means we should see even stronger cash flow generation in 2019 as reflected in our guidance.  From a financial perspective, the bottom line is this. We delivered one of our strongest years on record and we expect even stronger results in 2019as we enter the final year of our M2019 plan.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Jay for closing remarks. Jeffrey Craig : Thanks, Kevin. Let's go to Slide 14. On December 6, I hope you can join us in New York for Analyst Day. At that time, we look forward to sharing with you our new M2022 plan. I think you'll find that plan to be as aggressive that to you before and driving shareholders value but no less achievable.  Before we go to Q&A, I want to recognize again the Meritor team around the world. Our employees have manage the challenges this year and the unrelenting work schedules its required with great success. This team has a remarkable dedication to meeting our commitments. From our manufacturing plants to our corporate offices we share the desire to be a leader which we demonstrated for many years now.  Now let's take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : I guess I just wanted to start on some of the outperformance stuff you reported and as a sort release of \u201919. I think if we go back to analyst day last year you were looking for about $315 million of outperformance. It looks like you did a little bit better with the $325 million and then there was still if I recall correctly, like you had a gross opportunity of $625 million and you were putting in like a risk adjusted number of about $190 million to get to that $660 million. So you know now that we're a year forward I'm assuming that's not necessarily a risk adjusted or unawarded number at this point. Is that correct? like that were you able to actually execute on those opportunities that you saw in the marketplace? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, Joseph you've got some of the numbers right. The $315 million we talked about was business that we had won but was not yet in the P&L and that wasn't an \u201818 number that was an \u201818 and \u201819 number. And if you look at the combination of those two columns from Analyst Day with 315 and a risk adjusted number of 145. So let's combine about another $460 million of revenue outperformance in \u201818 and \u201819. And so what we're saying is we achieved $325 million of that $460 million in \u201818. Frankly a little bit quicker than we were originally anticipating in our guidance at the midpoint suggests we'll get the balance of $135 million in 2019. So right on track for that $660 million in total revenue outperformance. Joseph Spak : Okay, of that $315 million I guess you're right which was sort of not in the P&L over and I know presumably most of that was or the line share that was in \u201818 versus \u201819. Is that fair? Kevin Nowlan : It's a mix. I think some of that still coming in \u201819 as we grow some of those new business wins that were we had won but they still might be ramping up in \u201819. So it's a mix. But I'd say the bulk of that column 315 was what we saw in 2018. Joseph Spak : And then I guess like you know if we sort of compare and contrast again like you know your outlook for Class 8 in FY \u201819 is now higher than you thought about a year ago. So how do we think about sort of volume adjusting some of those targets. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean when you think of that Class 8 truck market being up. You know if you look at just 2018 what happened to the truck market going from 237,000 Class 8 trucks to 38000 Class 8 trucks. What that effectively means it's about $280 million dollars of incremental revenue from \u201817 to \u201918 from the Class 8 truck market. But obviously keep in mind we grew $830 million in the year with a big chunk of that being the revenue outperformance.  I think as you look at the outlook we provided at Analyst Day last year, I think the revenue was quite a bit lower than what we're now projecting for 2019. Now we're projecting $4.25 billion. I think we're a little south of $4 billion and a big piece of that is a Class 8 truck market is stronger and that's reflected in our guidance. Joseph Spak : Okay, maybe moving to the free cash like, if I look at your guidance for \u201919, it looks like a free cash flow conversion is almost 10 percentage points sort of higher than what you realized in \u201818. It sounds like maybe you're going to talk more about sort of free cash flow and the path forward at the Analyst Day but given that you've already sort of given \u201819 guidance here, I was wondering if you could just talk about what are some of the drivers of that improvement and maybe like to have an ultimate goal on sort of conversion? Kevin Nowlan : In terms of what's happening in '19, fundamentally, it's that as revenue levels off, we're making less investment in working capital. So, in 2018, we had $830 million of revenue growth. Our working capital tends to run 8% to 10% or so of revenue. So, we were making those investments in working capital, particularly inventory. But as revenue levels off in '19, we no longer have the overhang of incremental working capital investment which simply means that more of the earnings flow to the bottom-line as free cash flow. And so, that's what's fundamentally happening which is a good level of free cash flow and something, in a stable environment, we'd be able to throw off as we look forward. But you're right. We'll provide more guidance and more thoughts on how we see cash flow progressing and what we do with that cash flow beyond '19 when we get to analyst day in a few weeks. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then just real quick, on the buyback -- and it sounded like Jay, in your opening comments, you want to try to attack that fairly aggressively. Although, it doesn't look like in the guidance you're assuming much of anything in terms of excess buybacks. Maybe some to offset regular dilution. So, how should we think about you attacking or executing against that? And is it really just opportunistic? And over what time frame should we think that you execute that entire plan over? Jeffrey Craig : Yes. Good question and observation, Joe. I think you're right. Implied in the guidance is all of the share buybacks we executed in 2018. But we don't have anticipation of those buybacks in our '19 guidance. Please remember that our cash flow tends to be most significant in the middle of our year, so as you get into the end of Q2, Q3, and the beginning of Q4. So, that's when we tend to execute the bulk of our buybacks. So, for the impact on EPS, it tends to be back-end loaded. We obviously view the price at which our shares are trading right now as just a great opportunity if we look at our earnings multiples and the stability of our company based on all the deleveraging we've done. And I think what places us somewhat unique in our space is we have no calls on our cash flow. We're at the debt levels we want to be. Our legacy liabilities are really pretty well taken care of and behind us. So, all this free cash flow generation can be directed toward growth or share buybacks. So, quite frankly, we're very excited with the trading levels of our stock and potentially the opportunity it provides us in the near-term. Q - Unidentified Analyst Joseph Spak : Okay. Thanks. Congrats. And look forward to seeing you guys in a couple weeks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line's open. Joe Nolan : Hi. This is Joe Nolan on for Neil. Congrats on a great quarter. I know that you guys said that you almost completely offset steel cost in the quarter. But I was just wondering what that headwind was on a year-over-year basis. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. On a full-year basis when we look at '18 versus '17, we almost entirely offset it. When you look Q4 to Q4, we did have a little bit of a headwind. Call it about $2 million or so. And sequentially, even going from Q3 to Q4 because we've seen steel cost ramping up in the back half our fiscal year. We also saw a sequential headwind probably of $4-ish million going from Q3 to Q4. But full-year '18 versus '17, the way steel moved and our recovery mechanisms kicked in, it was a push. Joe Nolan : Got it. And then what is embedded in the fiscal year '19 EBITDA guidance for steel cost headwind? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. The assumption is that we're going to be burying the cost of the movements that we saw in steel in the season, the back half of our fiscal year. And as you know, our recovery mechanisms in our OE contracts work on a lag. So, we'll have a little bit of a lag that creates a headwind from a steel perspective. Call it high-single-digit millions of steel cost on a year-over-year basis which is embedded in our guidance that we provided. Joe Nolan : Okay. And then can you just talk about the success of the mid-year price increase within the aftermarket business? And did that benefit margins at all in the fiscal year fourth quarter? Jeffrey Craig : Sure. I think we have been successful in executing the price increases we planned for. I think you see that on the fourth quarter results of our aftermarket group. We're achieving the objectives we set out for this year to return that business to more normalized margins. And we're very pleased with the run rate of the profitability of that business going into 2019. Joe Nolan : Okay. That's it for me. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Jason Stulgrair : Hi, guys. Good morning. This is Jason Stulgrair on for Brian Johnson. I was just hoping to ask about the margins in the quarter. I guess I'll follow up from the previous question. The margins in aftermarket and industrial above 14%. It sounds like that's largely the effect of price increases. And you guys would expect that run rate to continue into 2014. So, just wanted to confirm that wasn't necessarily a one-time timing issue and that was a more structural change in that business. Kevin Nowlan : No, you're correct. If you look at the full year, what we saw in the aftermarket business is we were incurring certain costs, freight costs, steel costs, other costs throughout the entirety of the year. And we didn't execute pricing actions to mitigate the bulk of those cost increases until Q4. So, we generated a Q4 margin in that segment of 14.7% which is obviously higher than what the full-year margin for the segment was. And there is nothing unusual about that. It's the fact that we're now recovering the cost that we were seeing throughout the year. So, as we head into '19, our expectation is we'll see a typical dip in Q1 as we normally do in the segment because that's the seasonal low point for aftermarket with fewer selling days in the quarter. But as we look at the last nine months or the last three quarters of the year, that we're expecting aftermarket industrial margins to be well north of 14% for each of those quarters going forward. Jason Stulgrair : Okay. Yes. Terrific. And then I guess just moving to commercial truck and trailer, margins were a little lower in the quarter on top of strong volume. And I know you guys called out material and freight headwinds in both segments in the press release. And so, obviously, higher material and freight comes with growth. But was there anything that surprised you in the quarter like premium freights or spends of inefficiencies that surprised you for efficiency of growth? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I guess a couple things. When you look at the truck segment that you're talking about, truck and trailer, if you're looking at Q4 to Q4 as opposed to the full-year which is what our press release was focused on -- but Q4 to Q4, I'd say there are really three things. One is we do have currency impacting the business right now. The US dollar has gotten stronger in the last few months. You can see just on a year-over-year basis versus the Reais. The Reais depreciated almost 25%. The Swedish Krona's depreciated quite a bit. So, Q4 to Q4, we saw headwinds from that. Don't forget we also had the Meritor WABCO business that a year ago, we owned, and we no longer own. That's worth about 90 basis points to that segment in Q4 numbers. And then we did incur some premium costs as we were delivering on the strong markets and the peak markets that we're seeing. And as Jay mentioned in his remarks, we're investing in some supplier capacity, making some modest supplier capacity investments to be able to mitigate the costs as we look ahead. Jeffrey Craig : Yes. Jason, I'd just add to that. One part of your question I think was were we surprised by that. I'd say quite the opposite. What we saw -- and you saw this in us being able to realize many of the M2019 revenue grains earlier than we anticipated -- we saw an opportunity to really lock in those market share and revenue gains. And so, we purposely incurred some premiums, bringing on some new suppliers to bring that volume in. And with the site investments we'll make in those suppliers, we're already seeing those premiums abate. And we should see them virtually disappear by the first calendar quarter or second fiscal quarter. The payback on those investments was a matter of months. And we just felt it was a great opportunity to lock in additional market share and still be able to hit both our near-term and mid-term financial commitments. Jason Stulgrair : Okay. Great. And then just one more if I could. On the 2019 revenue target of $4.25 billion, obviously, it increased from 2018. But as I look at the end markets that you guys are forecasting, the increase in revenue target from where you guys were at investor day which, as you guys alluded to, was just under $4 billion to now is like a 7%-8% increase. But with end-markets like Class 8 trucks and Class 57 trucks in North America increased around the 20% range from investor day, it just seems like some of us might have been expecting a stronger 2019 number given where you guys ended up with your end-markets. So, are there any other puts and takes there? Is that pricing? Is it FX that we should be considering? Kevin Nowlan : Well, I guess a couple things. One is keep in mind the Class 8 truck market going up from where we were in 2017 to even this year is worth $280 million. And we increased our revenue this year $830 million. So, while the truck market is stronger, that wouldn't drive something that's hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars higher. It's $280 million higher year-over-year. And you're seeing that in our guidance. But we are also seeing then an FX headwind as we head into 2019 of about $100 million. And you can see that with the strengthening US dollar against most of the European currencies, the Chinese currencies, the Brazilian Reais. So, it's really across the board that we're seeing that revenue headwind. Jason Stulgrair : Okay. That's it for me. Congrats on finishing up a great fiscal '18, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Faheem Sabeiha : Congrats on a great quarter. I was just sticking to the revenue outlook for next year. Wondering if you can provide a little commentary around your aftermarket industrial business. And it seems like that $50 million sales increase is primarily coming from the Class 8 market. Just wondering if you can provide some thoughts as far as what the guide implies for the aftermarket industrial business. Kevin Nowlan : Effectively, that's right. The bulk of the market increase we're talking about is really Class 8. And if you do the math based on the guidance we've given before, every 5,000 Class 8 trucks translates to about $20 million of revenue. So, it's a little bit more than $40 million associated with the Class 8 truck market. So, it's the bulk of the increase. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And then your production outlook for North America Class 8 seemed a little conservative given where the industry's backlog sits today. Is your initial production guide based on current delivery schedules that's being communicated by your customers? Do you guys not have much confidence in the order or it's past the first half of calendar '19? Just any thoughts around there would be great. Jeffrey Craig : Yes. I think our outlook is very consistent with the market services of ACT and FCR if you look at those in the first part of our year. I think we have a little uncertainty as compared to them in Q4. And that's not really based on current production outlook from the OE customers. It's really just looking forward. And I think we are a little more conservative in our outlook in our fiscal Q4 just given how long this upturn has lasted so far. So, obviously, we'll see how that Q4 turns out. But that's really the main difference. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And you guys talked a little about the material cost for next year. I'm just wondering what else is embedded in your incremental margin. It looks like it's gonna be at the high end of your typical range. Just any sort of commentary around freight costs and pricing. That would be great. Kevin Nowlan : Hi. You're right. The implicit guidance we have there is that it's about 20% incremental conversion on a year-over-year basis. I mentioned that steel is a headwind in the single-digit millions of dollars. Remember, in our 2018 results you saw on the walk we did from '17 to '18, we did have a one-time environmental remediation reserve that we booked. So, as you look on a year-over-year basis, that should be a tailwind on the causal going '18 to '19. But when you net all the puts and takes out, it means that we're probably converting on normal incremental revenue growth in that 15% to 20%, probably closer to the 15% range with all the puts and takes. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And just one last question. Regarding your braking business, as the market shifts to the single-piston air brakes, which, from what I understand, have lower payback periods over the next few years, just wondering if these next-gen disc brakes would be a net neutral or loss from a content standpoint versus the brakes that are -- Jeffrey Craig : Well, yes. Good question. The content on single-piston disc brakes is still markedly higher than a drum brake. It's less than our dual-piston brake which is currently being specked. But I think what we're seeing is you can expect configurations on trucks that they most likely will have dual-piston on the front axles and potentially single-piston on the two rear axles. So, overall, compared to the drum brake content, there's significantly increased content in that configuration. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Carl Anderson for any further remarks. Carl Anderson : Thank you, Catherine. We thank you for your participation on today's call. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Carl Anderson, Group Vice President of Finance. You may begin. Carl Anderson : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and President Trailer & Components and Chief Financial Officer.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you\u2019ll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay. Jay Craig : Thanks, Carl, and good morning. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3. We had a great first quarter, with total company revenue up $135 million from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5%, and we generated $0.79 of adjusted diluted EPS. Higher truck production, combined with market share gains in North America, drove the majority of the revenue increase. But we also had year-over-year sales growth in South America and India as well as in North American Aftermarket, Trailer and Industrial. Kevin will give you more color on the quarter, but we are obviously pleased to begin the year with such excellent financial performance. With our strong first quarter performance and a higher Class 8 market than previously expected, we are raising our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook for the year. On Slide 4, we provided an update on the $200 million equity repurchase program we announced in November. You\u2019ll recall that our Board of Directors had just approved this additional share buyback program following the completion of our previous program. In the first fiscal quarter of 2019, we utilized $50 million under this recent authorization to repurchase another 3 million shares, which now completes 25% of the new program. As we referenced last month at Analyst Day, since 2014, we\u2019ve invested about half the Company\u2019s free cash flow in share buybacks. With the strong cash flow we expect to generate for fiscal 2019, we will continue to be opportunistic in buying back our shares. As Kevin told you in December, we firmly believe that our ability to generate cash flow and deploy that cash to create shareholder value is the most underappreciated aspect of Meritor\u2019s story. On the next couple of slides, we want to highlight the growth in our trailer, off-highway and specialty businesses. We have recently signed three significant contracts for new trailer business, as you\u2019ll see on Slide 5. Last month, we told you about the three-year renewal with Wabash that maintains Meritor\u2019s loose axles in standard precision on all Wabash Dry and refrigerated van trailer products. Also with this contract, the Meritor Tire Inflation System is the preferred automatic tire inflation system. Optional products for all Wabash configurations include air disc brakes, the trailing arm suspension and our recently launched MTec6 trailer axle. We\u2019re also excited to announce today that we\u2019ve signed a two-year agreement with Great Dain. This is a conquest win that gives us standard position for loose axles and automated slack adjustors. This is a meaningful award that allows us to strengthen our relationship with Great Dane in these product lines and also provides further revenue opportunity with this important customer. In addition, we now have standard position with Stoughton for loose axles and preferred position for MTIS. With these agreements, Meritor has solidified its position with three of the top six trailer manufacturers. Moving to Slide 6, you will see some examples of the growth we\u2019ve achieved in off-highway and specialty. Growing these businesses is a key priority for us and our M2019 and M2022 plans. We announced in December that we had completed a strategic supply agreement with Manitowoc to supply a variety of drivetrain products for several types of cranes under its Grove brand. This conquest win is another step towards establishing Meritor as a leader in the commercial off-highway industry in North America. To that end, we\u2019re also seeing more heavy haul fleets specking their vehicles with Meritor\u2019s P600 planetary axle, which we specifically engineered for heavy haul oilfield, logging and mining applications. RyTy Developments, which provides heavy hauling and off-road transportation services for the Canadian gas and oil industry, recently became the first fleet in the region to order their Kenwood trucks with our P600 axle. The strength and reliability of Meritor\u2019s off-highway products, combined with our vertically integrated short lead times, ready access to service and support with 24-hour part availability and our long-standing relationships on the line haul side of the business, are driving demand for Meritor\u2019s off-highway drivetrain solutions. On the specialty side of the business, we mentioned in December that we are supplying a unique transfer case for Navistar on the launch of its international CV Series Class 4 and 5 truck. These trucks will feature Meritor\u2019s two-speed, gear-driven transfer case with 3,000 pound per foot capacity and electric shifting controls. We are the first to market a gear-driven transfer case for this class of trucks. We have started production of this product in our Laurinburg plant in North Carolina where we have made a significant investment to support the expansion of our Industrial business. Shifting next to electrification on Slide 7. We were proud to be featured at the recent CES technology show as Peterbilt unveiled its new Class 6 pickup and delivery truck. With CES being the global stage for next-generation innovations, it was exciting to be highlighted as the supplier in collaboration with TransPower of Peterbilt\u2019s 220 elective drive system shown here with Peterbilt\u2019s Head of Engineering. Our relationship with TransPower continues to grow with an additional investment we recently made into the company. The full system solutions available through TransPower as well as our own proprietary eAxle currently in development makes Meritor an excellent choice for electric vehicle manufacturers around the world, which is evident by our growing customer base. In closing, I\u2019m pleased with our performance in the first quarter and with our outlook for the fiscal year. We are on track to achieve another successful year in 2019. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the financials, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Kevin Nowlan : Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll review our first quarter financial results and our updated 2019 guidance. Overall, as you heard from Jay, we delivered a strong start to the final year of our M2019 plan. We drove increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. Let\u2019s walk through the details by turning to Slide 8 where you\u2019ll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $1,038,000,000 in the quarter, up $135 million from a year ago, driven primarily by higher truck production and increased market share. The largest increase came from North America with Class 8 production up 24% compared to last year. In Brazil, the truck market recovery continues with Q1 production up 21% this year. And finally, growth in our other North American businesses, Aftermarket, Trailer and Industrial also contributed to the rise in sales. As you can see from the causal on the right, we converted on this revenue at about 16%, which is in line with our normal expected range. Included in this conversion is higher earnings performance at our unconsolidated joint ventures, which are also capitalizing on the global market conditions. This conversion was partially offset by FX headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduced sales by $26 million and adjusted EBITDA by $6 million compared to the prior year. The result is that we generated adjusted EBITDA of $119 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, a 50 basis point expansion over last year. Gross margin came in at 13.6% this quarter, down from 14.6% a year ago. Operating at these production levels and in this overall market environment, we have seen some pressure on gross margin, primarily driven by higher material, freight and other premium costs. We do expect gross margin to recover throughout the year as we have not yet fully recovered the increases in steel costs that we experienced in the latter half of 2018. Additionally, we expect to see some benefit from pricing actions in our Aftermarket business that were implemented in January to mitigate such costs. One more point on gross margin. Due to a recent accounting standard update that we implemented this quarter, you\u2019ll notice that our gross margin for both this year and last year now reflects the removal from operating expenses of the non-service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense. These amounts have been reclassified to the line item other income on our income statement. As you move down the table on the left, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re reporting $90 million of GAAP net income from continuing operations, which is significantly higher than last year. There were two key drivers to this increase. Last year, we recognized $77 million of non-cash tax expense arising from the enactment of U.S. tax reform. And this year, we recognized a $31 million gain from remeasuring the Maremont asbestos liability. I\u2019ll be discussing this in more detail in a subsequent slide. Adjusted income from continuing operations, which excludes the impact of both of these items, was $69 million, resulting in $0.79 per adjusted diluted share, a 27% increase over last year. And finally, free cash flow was negative $12 million this quarter compared to an inflow of $15 million in the same period last year. Higher adjusted income was more than offset by increased incentive compensation payments due to our 2018 financial performance, investments in inventory to support stronger revenue and increased capital expenditures as we invested more in supporting our growth opportunities. Let\u2019s move to Slide 9, which details our first quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Trailer segment, sales increased by 16% to $824 million. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher truck production in North America and increased market share. Unfavorable foreign currency impacts due to the strengthening dollar only partially offset these gains. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $79 million, up $10 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Trailer came in at 9.6%, roughly flat compared to last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, partially offset by higher material and freight costs, SG&A expense and FX. In our Aftermarket & Industrial segment, sales were $257 million, up 12% from last year. This increase was primarily driven by our North America aftermarket, specialty and defense businesses. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $38 million, an increase of $6 million or almost 20% compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin grew 80 basis points to 14.8%. This growth was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue. On Slide 10, I wanted to provide an update on the actions of our non-operating subsidiary, Maremont. Recall that in December, we announced that Maremont was seeking to create a trust under Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to resolve all correct and future asbestos claims. Last week, we announced that Maremont and its subsidiaries voluntarily filed cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The remaining key actions include confirmation of the reorganization plan by the courts and funding of the trust, primarily with a $28 million contribution and the repayment of an approximately $21 million intercompany loan by Meritor. As a result of this initiative, we recorded a $31 million gain in the first quarter as we remeasured Maremont\u2019s net asbestos liability to the terms of the reorganization plan, which now represents the best estimate of the liability. Once the bankruptcy process is complete, these actions are expected to eliminate approximately 70% of net asbestos liabilities from Meritor\u2019s balance sheet. Next, I\u2019ll review our updated fiscal year 2019 global market outlook on Slide 11. Although we saw some softening of Class 8 truck orders in December, the backlog is still almost 300,000 units. This gives us confidence that production levels should remain elevated for the rest of our fiscal year. Therefore, we are increasing our production estimate by 10,000 trucks to approximately 330,000, driven primarily by our expectations for a stronger fourth quarter than we were previously anticipating. Our forecast for the remainder of our market is unchanged, so we are keeping volume assumptions at our prior guidance levels for all of these other markets. Overall, solid to strong global end markets continue to support our positive outlook for 2019. Based on these updated assumptions, you can see we are raising our guidance on Slide 12. We now expect revenue to be approximately $4.3 billion, up $50 million from our prior guidance. We are maintaining our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 11.5%. In light of our stronger revenue outlook and the incremental conversion we\u2019re able to generate, we are modestly increasing our investment to support our electrification initiatives. This incremental investment is offsetting some of the margin conversion from our higher-revenue guide. In addition, as you think about Q2, we do expect to see our normal seasonal trend of increasing revenue sequentially. However, with the strong production levels we experienced in our first quarter, we expect the sequential step up to be much more modest in the next couple of quarters than we see in most years. For that reason, you should expect any sequential step-up in EBITDA margin to also be relatively modest. With stronger top line revenue, we expect to generate an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations. This higher income, coupled with the repurchase of 3 million common shares we executed in Q1, is expected to drive adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $3.30 per share, an increase of $0.20 from our prior guidance. This puts us close to $0.50 above our M2019 target. And finally, we are maintaining our free cash flow outlook at $175 million to $185 million. The increase in earnings from revenue growth expected in Q4 is expected to be largely offset by a corresponding increase in working capital investment, which yields no change to our free cash flow guidance for 2019. As we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, this is the level of cash performance you should expect from Meritor to generate as we transition from M2019 to M2022, and it\u2019s this level of cash generation that supports our M2022 capital allocation priorities as we focus on investing in strategic growth and returning value to our shareholders. We\u2019re excited about the positive start to this year, which puts us on the path to successful conclusion of our M2019 plan. Now we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, great, thanks. I was wondering if you could provide some more color in your business in China, including after Caterpillar missed earnings the other day, setting a slowdown in that market. I see on Slide 6 that your sales in China actually surged in 2018, but just curious if you\u2019re seeing any of the same slowdown more recently. And maybe if you could remind us of some of your more unique customer end market exposures within China we should be thinking about in the current environment. Jay Craig : Yes, good question, Ryan. We\u2019re still expecting the market to be flat this year as compared to last year. The segments we\u2019re involved in, such as with XCMG, in construction are holding up similar to what we saw last year as far as the infrastructure projects and their product support. And then we tend to be at the higher end of the quality spectrum on the on-highway. And so far, that\u2019s performing very similar to what it did last year. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great, thanks. Just lastly for me too, I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the market share gains. You\u2019ve had several in the Trailer segment. Just curious who you\u2019re winning these from, and what the outlook is going forward. Jay Craig : Well, I\u2019ll begin that. I\u2019m actually going to ask Kevin to talk a little bit about Trailers since he\u2019s leading that business for us. And he and the team have done an excellent job of getting our product development strategies aligned with what the customer markets are demanding, and I think that\u2019s starting to show in that three wins we talked about today. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, as it relates to Trailer, I mean, the performance that we\u2019re generating in terms of seeing some market share gains are being driven by our strong delivery performance as well as our high-quality product. And so we continue to be the leader in that trailer market in terms of supplying loose axle and among the market leaders in tire inflation. So strong product, strong delivery performance and strong quality have been supportive of us gaining share there. Ryan Brinkman : Very good, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joe Spak : Thanks. Good morning, congratulations. Jay Craig : Thanks, Joe. Joe Spak : Just maybe we could start in Commercial Truck. First of all, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, I was wondering just how much of an FX headwind was in that segment this quarter. And then back at the envelope, it looks to us like maybe 75% to 80% of the organic growth was from what I\u2019d call market and then maybe the rest was sort of your new business and end market share gains. Is that \u2013 do you roughly agree with those numbers? Kevin Nowlan : On the market share gains, I have to come back to you. It\u2019s probably in the ZIP code. I mean, we had tens of million dollars \u2013 tens of millions of dollars of revenue outperformance as I look Q1-to-Q1 on a year-over-year basis. I didn\u2019t do the math to see is that 25% or so, but it\u2019s probably in that ZIP code somewhere. Joe Spak : Okay. Kevin Nowlan : And with respect to the question on FX headwind, the bulk of that headwind is in the Commercial Truck & Trailer segment because the Aftermarket & Industrial business is predominantly in North American business. They have some European exposure, but it\u2019s predominantly a North America-based business. Joe Spak : Okay. And you said it was $26 million. Is it what? For the total company? Was that the number? Kevin Nowlan : Revenue of the whole company, $6 million of EBITDA. That\u2019s right. Joe Spak : Okay. And then just in Aftermarket, if I recall correctly, I think you were sort of taking some pricing actions there because that was sort of the area where you were able to offset some of the raw material movements. Is that what occurred? And how \u2013 and if so, how much did that contribute in the quarter? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean, part of what we executed in the middle of last year, in July of last year, we did execute some pricing actions to mitigate some of the costs that we were seeing from a steel perspective and a freight perspective. And as we started this new calendar year in January, we\u2019ve continued to execute pricing actions to reflect any market economics that we\u2019re seeing. I\u2019d also point out in that segment, the Industrial business is performing well as well and saw some growth and contributed to margin growth there. Joe Spak : Okay, and maybe just a follow-up then. And I think you were sort of \u2013 previously, sort of talking about this business that could get sort of 14%, 15% margins, but I think that was before you made some reporting changes. So is there any additional sort of color you\u2019re willing to provide on sort of what you think the right or the ultimate sort of margin potential of the Aftermarket Industrial business is? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think you, obviously, saw a big step-up in margin on a year-over-year basis, 80 basis points. We expect that business to operate north of 14% each quarter as we look ahead through 2019, and that\u2019s a step-up from what we saw a year ago because we did have a couple of quarters in the middle of the year where we operated below 14% on a fully loaded basis. So we are expecting to operate north of 14% in that business for the year. Joe Spak : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Picariello of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. James Picariello : Hey, guys. So for your joint ventures, I mean, you had a solid quarter for equity income. Just wondering if you could talk about \u2013 you have, I think, four primary joint ventures at this point. Can you talk about what drove the upside in the quarter and how are you think about the rest of the year? Jay Craig : Yes, I think \u2013 thanks, James. I think you can think about those joint ventures really seeing the benefit of the end market increases and market share gains that we talked about. So we have our Mexican joint venture, Sysmex, for example, that shared in the growth we saw in North America. We\u2019re seeing the recovery in Brazil, and that bring Masters, our braking joint venture\u2019s results along with that. And then we\u2019ve talked about the strength of India as well, and so we have our significant joint venture there with the Kalyani Group. So it\u2019s pretty widespread, just those joint ventures participating both in our market share gains and the end market increases. James Picariello : Yes. On the topic of India, you have new missions, standards hitting. You also have a mandatory forced aging of the fleet of replacement greater than 20 years or older. So what\u2019s your outlook on the timing of when you might see some significant prebuy ahead of both of those factors in the market? And are you already seeing it? Or right now, is this \u2013 would you chalk this up to just strong market demand? Jay Craig : I think it\u2019s really primarily strong market demand, I think, if we would expect may be late in 2019. But remember, India does have some history of pushing off those deadlines because the market at times cannot ramp up capacity to meet the demand required for those changes in regulation. And we are making some modest increases in our capacity through our joint venture to make sure we\u2019re ready for that. But I would say it, we would expect at earliest to see the impact of those changes in late 2019. James Picariello : Got it. Appreciate it. Just last one, if I could. Have you guys quantified the commodity headwind that you expect for FY2019 in terms of the incremental impact? That\u2019s it. Thanks. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean, in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, it had a few million dollars of negative impact on us. Remember, steel indices are actually up, particularly in North America, year-over-year anywhere from about 20% to 30%. Now most of that increase happened in the latter part of 2018, so it\u2019s really just a delay as our recovery mechanisms start to kick in. And we\u2019ll start to see some sequential tailwind from that heading into Q2. But if you take a step back, in totality for the full year, 2019 versus 2018, we expect steel to be a headwind on a net basis high single-digit millions, and that\u2019s embedded in our guidance. James Picariello : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel of Stifel. Your line is now open. Mike Baudendistel : Thank you. Can you give us some sense, I mean, these contracts seem pretty significant on the trailer side, just what \u2013 how big those contracts are in terms of revenue? And sort of how that fits into your plan to outperform the market? Kevin Nowlan : It\u2019s \u2013 this is Kevin, I\u2019ll speak to that. It\u2019s a mix. I mean, a couple of those are solidifying existing positions that we have, particularly with Wabash and Stoughton, although they position us to grow with certain product categories with those key customers. In the case of Great Dane, there is some conquest business there that we achieved on loose axles and slack adjustors. So important growth opportunities for that trailer business. Mike Baudendistel : Got it. So it\u2019s a mix of the two. I guess, can you also \u2013 just getting back to the materials cost, can you sort of explain why that seems to be impacting the margins on the Commercial Truck & Trailer side but not the Aftermarket side? And when does it start to be a neutral or \u2013 on a year-over-year basis? Kevin Nowlan : Well, for Commercial Truck, remember, we have recovery mechanisms with our OE customers that kick in generally on about a six-month lag. So as we saw steel indices increasing towards the back half of our fiscal year 2018, those mechanisms simply haven\u2019t had a chance yet to kick in. With Aftermarket, Aftermarket updates its pricing periodically once or twice per year based on overall macroeconomic conditions inclusive of steel. And so the Aftermarket started pricing for that back in January \u2013 or back in July of last year and started to see some recovery from the mechanisms from the increase in steel indices that we were seeing last year. So they saw a little bit of an improvement sooner than the truck business. Mike Baudendistel : Got it. That makes sense. That\u2019s all I had this morning. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Your line is now open. Colin Langan : Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you. Colin Langan : More of an accounting question, but there was $11 million of other income, which typically, that\u2019s only a couple of million or zero. Any color on what that is in the quarter and whether that\u2019s a sustainable number? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, Collin, this relates to an accounting standard update that we had to implement this quarter. So it\u2019s actually the reclassification of non-service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense. So that\u2019s about $9 million that we moved out of gross margin or cost of goods sold that\u2019s actually income and moved down to other income. We actually recast 2018\u2019s numbers as well. So you\u2019ll see that went from a number that was de minimis to now it\u2019s a positive $8 million in Q1 of a year ago. So that\u2019s simply an accounting change that we had to make that impacted both last year and this year. Colin Langan : Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then when we think of share repurchases, those $50 million in the quarter, is that the pace that we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? Is that \u2013 or will it move around through the year? Jay Craig : I think you should remember, Colin, as our cash flows tend to be seasonal, where we generate a meaningful portion of our free cash flow in Q3. And then we do have some other obligations, one of which Kevin spoke to, the funding of the Maremont liabilities that we think are upcoming. So we saw a great opportunity in Q1, given the price at which our shares were trading and we felt highly confident on our free cash flow projection for the year. So we decided to lean out a little in Q1 and take advantage of that market disconnect in our valuation. Colin Langan : Got it. Any \u2013 can you just remind me of the $200 million authorization for the next two years? Is there a time line on that? Kevin Nowlan : The $200 million authorization is open to be able to support repurchase activity through our 2022 planning horizon. And so it\u2019s just the initial approval that we\u2019ll execute on as we generate free cash flow and we see the opportunity to deploy cash accordingly. So at this point, we\u2019re $50 million utilized of that full $200 million, 25% done, but we\u2019ll continue to execute as we see opportunities to deploy cash accordingly. Colin Langan : Got it. And just lastly, any update \u2013 we covered most of the regions other than South America. I mean, any update on that business? I think you were expecting a small increase. Is that still on track? And how should we think about the potential there with maybe higher incrementals because of the low base you\u2019re off of? Jay Craig : Well, we are seeing a pretty measurable increase year-over-year, over 20%, and what we expect in the market, 18% to 19%. And we still feel confident in that. So I think we\u2019re feeling good about that. And the market with the new government in place, the confidence seems to be developing in the country. And I would say, we\u2019re considerably more optimistic on that market recovering to more normalized levels. Colin Langan : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Your line is now open. Brian Johnson : Yes, good morning. I have question is on two fronts, just some of the margin in Aftermarket and then on EVs. On the margin, I think you alluded to this, but what \u2013 is what we can take away from the lack of freight, SG&A and material offsets in Aftermarket \u2013 in the Aftermarket Industrial business that it\u2019s just shorter cycle pricing and you\u2019re able to move those factors up and down, so you just \u2013 it\u2019s just basically straight incrementals there? Kevin Nowlan : No, I\u2019d actually say it\u2019s more because we\u2019ve reacted to what we\u2019ve seen in the market from escalating costs throughout 2018, and we executed some pricing actions in July of last year to mitigate the impact of those. So we have seen increased freight costs last year in 2018 and other economic factors, and we\u2019ve been pricing for it. Brian Johnson : Okay. Secondly, over on the EV front, we know you guys have 22 prototype programs out there. Is there any kind of way to bucket what you\u2019re spending the EV money on? Is there kind of a core technology that you spend on across all those programs? Is it just on each prototype? Or kind of any way to kind of think about that? And then how that might progress if any of those actually move closer to production? Jay Craig : Yes, I would say, Brian, we\u2019re spending, you could say, approximately $10 million this coming year on both our pure R&D and also prototype development where we\u2019re not receiving reimbursement from customers. So in certain cases, we do receive reimbursement from the customer for partial reimbursement of the cost we\u2019re incurring. But as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we\u2019ve seen such great opportunities there. We\u2019ve ramped up the spending a bit from what we had initially expected because of how well the company is performing and the opportunities we\u2019re seeing. Brian Johnson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Neil Frohnapple : Hi, thanks and congrats on a great quarter. First, I just want to round out the EBITDA margin discussion for the year. So I mean, you guys just delivered an 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin, well above expectations in, again, what is historically, I think, the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, so great performance there. So could you just talk about some of the puts and takes from a margin perspective for the remainder of the year to get to the 11.5% full year guidance. I know you guys cited the increased investment in electrification, but on the flip side, it sounds like you\u2019ll get maybe a sequential tailwind in Q2 from steel, the pricing initiatives in Truck & Trailer and then expect higher gross margins, I think you said so. Again, just wanted to round that out, and if you could provide more color, that would be great. Kevin Nowlan : Okay. Thanks, Neil. Definitely, I mean, we\u2019re pleased with the fact that we started the first quarter strong. 11.5%, up 50 basis points year-over-year is a strong first quarter for us. As we look ahead, the first thing I would just mention is that, typically, our second and third quarter, we see a much more robust step-up from a revenue perspective than what we would expect this year because Q1 was so strong from a revenue perspective. And take last year, going from Q1 to Q3, revenue was up $200-ish-plus million from one quarter to the third quarter. This year, we expect it to be up less than $100 million. So there\u2019s a lot less conversion opportunity as you go from one quarter to the next. But we are expecting to continue to convert on that incremental revenue. So you see a little bit of upside in margin from that, but then being offset by some of the additional electrification investment that we\u2019ll be making over the next couple of quarters, starting in our second fiscal quarter. So net-net, we still expect to be around approximately 11.5% for the full year, but pretty pleased with the start to the year. Neil Frohnapple : Okay, thanks for the color, Kevin. And then with NAFTA Class 8 production this past quarter coming meaningfully higher than expected due to a surge in build, I think, in the month of December, did that require you to more over time and things like escalated freight cost to serve the market, which may have laid on Commercial Truck & Trailer margin in the quarter? And I guess just curious on relative to what you\u2019d expect for the rest of the year. Jay Craig : The short answer is, yes. We continue to see \u2013 so continuing less-than-optimal efficiency in our operating plans and also some additional premiums as we expedite freight. They were within our planning assumptions. So \u2013 and we do have some expectations for the rest of the year that we are running some layered capacity as we speak to it on the margins of our supply relationships. And we have embedded in the guidance that Kevin updated the cost of those additional expedited freight and layered capacity suppliers. Neil Frohnapple : Okay. Great, thank you so much, guys. Jay Craig : Thank you, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Potter : Hi, thanks. Good job in this quarter, guys. I guess, I have one additional question on electrification. Deploying more capital for that opportunity, which is a good sign. I\u2019m interested to know if this is something that you\u2019re doing opportunistically because you\u2019re doing better than what you thought, revenue is higher, margins are higher, so you can redeploy some capital. Or is that something that you would have likely done anyway? Jay Craig : Well, that\u2019s a good question. I think we, in my mind, probably would have done it anyway but would have had to allocate where different investments would have been reduced. I think with the good news we\u2019re seeing in the business, we\u2019re able to continue to deploy capital to all the opportunities we\u2019re seeing and increase that investment in electrification. I think, as you know, under this leadership team through M2016, 2019 and now 2020, we take the targets that we set very seriously and try to manage all our different puts and takes within those targets. But certainly, because of the strength we\u2019re seeing in our business, we were allowed to continue to make all the investments required. Alex Potter : Okay, very good. And another question on China also. I know that historically, you\u2019ve got more of an off-highway focus. You mentioned more \u2013 when it comes to the on-highway side of the business, there\u2019s more premium high end. But my understating is that that\u2019s also \u2013 one of the goals of the company, I suppose, is to increase exposure to the on- highway segment there. It\u2019s a area that you\u2019ve historically been under indexed. Is that \u2013 has there been any development in that regard? What do you expect over the next one, two, three years? Jay Craig : Yes, there have been developments. What I\u2019m pleased with is, we have an excellent disc brake offering in China. So we\u2019re starting to see opportunities there that are coming forward. In our core axle business, we continue to see opportunities on the premium side of the market. So the one caution I would give us, we will not derogate the margins of the overall company by chasing opportunities in spaces in that market that just don\u2019t have the returns required. And that\u2019s been our challenge over the years is that market has not had the returns for suppliers in our segment that have been acceptable to us. So we\u2019d \u2013 that\u2019s why our growth strategy has been more measured maybe than others. Alex Potter : Okay. Yes, that makes good sense. And then my last question, I guess, related to the supply chain in the U.S. Still, there\u2019s, as you mentioned, expedited freight, over time, things of that nature. Do you think the supply chain is properly capacitized at this point? Or when do you think that people have their upstream or downstream or whatever the supply bottlenecks are, do you think that more investment is likely to be earmarked to address those bottlenecks? Or do you think we\u2019re basically just going to be dealing with the current situation indefinitely until the backlog runs down? Jay Craig : I\u2019ll give a few brief comments and ask Kevin to provide additional detail. But as we spoke to previously, we\u2019ve increased some capacity in North America just beginning coming online here in January. And that capacity, directed at the Class 8 market, was \u2013 the investment was primarily directed at our supply base just trying to bring on more capacity and different suppliers. So we continue to monitor very closely but have to make some incremental investments to bring on that additional capacity. Kevin Nowlan : And this is Kevin, I\u2019ll just \u2013 I don\u2019t have much to add. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t anticipate seeing a significant step-up in investment beyond that. I think the modest investments we made in some supplier tooling to support the strong market that we anticipate, at least through the balance of this fiscal year, I think that\u2019ll carry us through this year. But I\u2019m not expecting to see more from the way of capacity investments beyond that at this point. Alex Potter : Okay. Nice job again, guys. Jay Craig : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Faheem Sabeiha of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Faheem Sabeiha : Hi, good morning guys and congrats on a good quarter. Just wondering, with the acceleration in share repurchases in Q1 and the funding of the Maremont trust coming up soon, can you maybe talk about your appetite to maybe use debt to make an acquisition if one were to come up over the next quarters? Jay Craig : Well, I think the question we ask ourselves is and the answer we provided in the rollout of the 2022 plan is we\u2019re very pleased with the core business and our ability to grow organically. So we continue to look at opportunities and acquisitions that are more bolt-on in nature. And really, we do not believe we are interested in a transformational acquisition of the scale that would take us off track on our capital allocation strategy that we laid out in the December Analyst Day. So we have a significant number of opportunities we\u2019re constantly evaluating, but those tend to be bolt-on in nature. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And final question for me. Can you talk about other opportunities for your gear transfer case within the Class 4 and 5 market, given the success you had getting on the platform with GM and Navistar, or maybe any other adjacent markets to that? Jay Craig : Well, we do see the investment we\u2019ve made and the development of that transfer case and also a brand-new assembly line in our Laurinburg facility that I spoke about on the call as an opportunity to look at additional market share gains in that area. So we don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t see anything specifically that will be announcing in the near-term, but we certainly are continuing to make headway in that market. And I think it\u2019s very unique technology that Navistar appreciated, and I think the end market will appreciate as that vehicles rolled out here over the next few months. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Carl Anderson for any closing remarks. Carl Anderson : Thank you. This does conclude Meritor\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger. Tom Linebarger : Thank you, James. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter results and finished with a discussion of our outlook for 2019. Mark will then take you through more details of our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year. Revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were a record $6.2 billion, an increase of 1% compared to the second quarter of 2018. EBITDA was a record $1.1 billion, or 17%, compared to $897 million, or 14.6%, a year ago. Lower campaign costs, positive pricing and lower material costs more than offset our increased investments in research and engineering, the impact of tariffs and lower joint venture income in China. Engine business revenues were flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago. Revenues in North America, increased by 7%, driven by higher industry production of heavy and medium duty trucks, as well as continued strong demand in construction markets. International revenues declined by 15%, primarily as a result of lower demand in Chinese light duty truck and construction markets. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 15.4%, compared to 13.4% for the same period in 2018. Lower campaign costs, improved pricing and lower material costs more than offset lower joint venture income increased investment in research and engineering, and the negative impact of tariffs. Sales for our distribution segment grew by 2% year-over-year, driven by higher demand for power generation equipment in North America. Second quarter EBITDA was a record $172 million or 8.5% of sales, compared to 7.3% in the second quarter 2018. EBITDA margins benefited from higher volumes and positive pricing. The second quarter revenues for the component segment declined by 2%. Sales in North America increased 5%, driven by higher truck build rates, while revenues in international markets declined by 12%, as a result of lower truck demand in Europe, China and India. EBITDA for the second quarter was $297 million, or 16.1%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in EBITDA margins was primarily due to lower campaign costs, and the benefit of material cost reduction programs, which more than offset increased development and increase investment in the development of new products, aimed at emission standards in China and India. We are currently selling a limited number of national standard six products for specific urban applications in China, such as sanitation vehicles and will ramp up production in 2020, and again in 2021, when all medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles are scheduled to comply with NS6 standards. In India, we will begin producing new products later this year, as we prepare for a transition to the broad stage 6 standard in April 2020. Power system sales in the second quarter declined by 3%. Demand in industrial markets declined 11% due to lower sales of oil and gas and mining engines, while sales of power generation products were flat. Power generation sales increased 12% in North America, driven by continued strength in the data center markets offset by 11% decline in International markets, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 2%. EBITDA in the second quarter was 14.4%, compared to 14.9% a year ago, the decrease in EBITDA was due largely to lower joint venture income in China, where we experienced declined demand for standby generator sets. In the Electrified Power business, EBITDA was a loss of $33 million in the second quarter, in line with our expectations, as we invest in the development of new products for commercial launch, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the second quarter of 2019, starting with North America, and then I'll cover some of our largest International markets. Our second quarter revenues in North America boost 7% to a record $3.9 billion driven by higher industry build rates of medium and heavy-duty trucks, continued growth in the sales of construction equipment and increased sales of power generation equipment to data center customers. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks grew 19% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to a year ago, and 4% compared to the first quarter of this year, supported by a strong, but declining industry backlog. Our market share through June was 35%, compared to 33% a year ago, representing our highest market share in five years, and reflecting the strong performance of our products in the eyes of our customers. Production of medium duty trucks increased 14% in the second quarter. A growing U.S. economy, coupled with high levels of consumer spending, low unemployment and low interest rates continues to drive demand for medium duty trucks. Our market share in the medium duty truck market was 78% through June, compared to 80% a year ago. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 20% compared to a year ago, as we increased production of a new engine for RAM2500 and 3500 pickup trucks. Year-to-date shipments for pickup truck customers have increased 6%. Engine demand for construction equipment in North America increased 10% in the second quarter and remained that historically high levels supported by non-residential construction and infrastructure spending. Revenues for power generation grew by 12% due to higher demand and data center markets partially offset by lower sales to recreational vehicle OEM. Demand for engines in oil and gas markets declined by 91% due to a sharp reduction in purchases of new fracking equipment. Our international revenues decreased by 6% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.5 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. Higher power generation equipment sales to datacenter customers and engine sales to oil and gas markets were partially offset by lower demand and on Highway in construction markets. Industry demand from medium and heavy-duty trucks and China decreased by 9% compared to a year ago, even though the market was positively impacted by a pre-buy of natural gas engines ahead of the move to NS6 standards in July. We estimate that the impact of this pre-buy was approximately 20,000 units, increasing market size by 5% in the quarter, our market share improved to 12.8% this quarter from 10.9% a year ago, as we increased our share at full-time. We expect further improvement in our market share in subsequent quarters due to further share expansion at our OEM, and a shift in the market towards over the road trucks versus construction related dump trucks. Industry sales of light duty trucks declined by 9% in the second quarter, and our engine market share was 8%, which is 1% higher than a year ago. This increase was driven by our new joint venture with JAC, which launched in late 2018. In the second quarter, the light duty market was impacted by increased enforcement of loading regulations, significantly reducing both second quarter industry demand and our projections for the remainder of the year. Some truck model has historically been registered as light duty trucks are now to be classified as medium duty trucks, which limits access to urban areas and requires additional licensing for drivers. Second quarter demand for excavators in China increased 4% from a year ago. Our market share increased from 15.3% to 15.6%, driven by the strong performance of our local partners. Demand for power generation equipment was down 3% in the second quarter, with lower demand for standby power, partially offset by growth in data center markets. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures was $516 million, a reduction of 1% from the second quarter a year ago with lower industry truck production and the impact of a week a rupee partially offset by increased demand for power generation equipment. Industry truck sales decreased 21% year-over-year in line with our expectations with lower demand driven by the timing of elections, as well as challenges in the truck financing industry. Within the truck market, we saw more severe decline in heavy duty applications where we have the highest share. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We now expect company revenues to be flat for the year, which is at the low end of our prior guidance range. We're maintaining our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America at 300,000 units, up 5% compared to 2018. The industry backlog declined this quarter to below 200,000 units from its peak of over 300,000 eight months ago. While inventory is elevated at 80,000 units. Our guidance assumes lower industry production of trucks in the fourth quarter, driven both by fuel workdays as well as reduced build rates. We expect our market to be at the high end of our prior forecast of 32% to 34%. The combination of the increased capacity of fleets and lower freight demand has resulted in lower utilization of available equipment in the industry. Because of this reduced utilization, we've seen lower demand in our parts and remanufacturing business. We expect parts demand to continue to be relatively weak through the end of the year as dealers begin to reduce parts inventory in anticipation of lower market activity. In the medium duty truck market, we are maintaining our forecast for industry production of 140,000 units, up 6% year-over-year and we expect our market share to be in the range of 74% to 76% unchanged from prior guidance. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for 2019, compared to a very strong 2018 and unchanged from our expectations three months ago. In China, we now expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 2% in 2019. We are maintaining our outlook for medium heavy new truck demand at 1.2 million units, representing a 10% decline from last year. In the light duty truck market we now expect a 12% reduction in demand, compared to our prior guidance of 7% down, this decline is driven by the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations I discussed earlier, we expect our market share in the medium and heavy duty market to be in the range of 13% to 14% and in light duty, expect our share to be 8% to 9%, both in line with our prior guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2018. This compares to our prior guidance of down 10%, and it's driven by increased exports of excavators developing countries primarily in Southeast Asia. In India, we now project revenue, including joint ventures to be down 5% compared to our prior guidance of flat. We anticipate industry demand for trucks to be 17% lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 and compared to our prior guidance of down 5%. Truck demand is being negatively impacted by the continuing high cost and low availability of credit in India shadow banking system, which has been under pressure due to defaults by non-bank lenders. We continue to expect power generation and construction to grow 5% to 10% due to continued infrastructure investment. In Brazil, we are now projecting truck production to increase 2% in 2019, down from 13%, three months ago. Economic growth has not accelerated Brazil as much as we anticipated this year. The GDP growth now projected at 1%, lower economic growth has resulted lower demand growth in truck, construction and power generation markets, compared to three months ago. We now project our revenues in Brazil to be down 10% compared to our prior projection of flat. We continue to expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to be down 5% this year, we project demand for oil and gas engines will decline 40%, which is unchanged from a prior guidance. However, we now anticipate sales in North America will decline by 75%, compared to our 60% down expectation three months ago with lower demand for new equipment in the Permian Basin, as well as reduced demand for engine rebuilds. This deterioration in our outlook for North America is offset by increased sales to China. The demand for mining engines has moderated over the last three months as commodity prices have fallen and capital budgets have been cut. We now expect mining engine sales to be down 5% lower than our prior guidance of up 5%. Demand for power generation equipment was flat in the second quarter, and we expect demand to remain at second quarter levels to the remainder of the year. We expect revenue to be flat for the full year with growth and data center markets and increased military revenue offset by lower sales of generator sets to the RV market, lower demand and backup power applications in China, and a drop in large plant power applications in Europe. In summary, we're now expecting revenues to be flat for the year at the low end of our previous guidance, driven by lower demand in international truck markets, moderating aftermarket demand in North America, and the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollars, we are maintaining our EBITDA guidance of 16.25%, to 16.75% of sales as lower joint venture income and the impact of lower volumes will be offset by lower material and other costs. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 15%, the 10th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. We continue to project returning 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. In June, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the majority of shares a fuel cell systems provider Hydrogenics Corporation for $290 million. This agreement is still set to Hydrogenic shareholder approval, as well as other customary closing conditions. Strong execution across all of our businesses resulted in record revenue being translated into record EBITDA and operating cash flow in the first half of the year. As we move into the second half of 2019, our guidance projects that revenues will decline from second quarter levels as several of our end markets experience lower levels of industry production. The company is well-positioned as we move this period to repeat our track record of increasing cycle over cycle earnings and returning significant cash to shareholders. We will continue to invest in technology to ensure the future success of our stakeholders, while reviewing areas for additional cost reduction and efficiency gains, as we have in prior cycles. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of the drivers of our strong financial performance in the second quarter, and then comment on our revised outlook for the full year. Second quarter revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 7%, and International revenues declined by 6%, currency movements negatively impacted overall company revenues by 2%. Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization or EBITDA were a record $1.1 billion or 17% of sales for the quarter. EBITDA increased by $161 million over the second quarter last year, as a result of stronger gross margins and higher other income, which more than offset increased research and development expenses and lower joint venture income. Gross margin of $1.6 billion, or 26.4%, improved by $201 million. Results for the second quarter of 2018 included a $181 million charge for an engine system campaign. In addition to lower campaign costs, improve pricing benefits from material cost reduction programs more than offset the impact of higher tariffs year-over-year. Our selling administrative and research costs $880 million increased by $48 million year-over-year, driven primarily by new product development in the engine components and Electrified Power segments. Joint venture income declined by $14 million, driven by weaker demand in light duty truck and power generation markets in China, in addition to some increased expenses in China associated with the launch of new on highway products, to meet the new National 6 emissions regulations. Other income of $43 million increased by $18 million, primarily driven by $18 million of mark-to-market gains on the investments that underpin our non-qualified benefit plans. The mark-to-market gains were recorded other income in the income statement, and with eliminations in our segment reporting. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4% down from 22.5% in the second quarter last year, and in line with our full year forecast of 21.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.27 in the second quarter, up from $3.32 last year, resulting from stronger earnings, a lower effective tax rate and the positive impact of share repurchase activity completed over the prior 12 months. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $808 million, bringing the year-to-date total to a record of $1.2 billion, up $747 million from the same period last year, driven by stronger earnings and a much slower pace of working capital expansion. I will now comment on our revised guidance for 2019. For the engine segment we expect full year revenues to be down 2% to up 2%, compared to our previous guidance of growth of 1% to 5%. This lower revenue outlook is the result of a weaker projection for parts sales in North America, weaker demand in that Chinese light duty truck market, and a slower pace of economic growth in Brazil. We've revised our forecast of EBITDA margins in the engine business to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16% driven primarily by the impact of the lower sales outlook, and weaker joint venture income in China. For the distribution segment, we now expect revenues to be 1% to 5%, compared to our prior guidance of 2% to 6% with a slight adjustment driven by a stronger dollar, and therefore a higher currency headwind. We are raising our outlook for EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be in the range of 8% to 8.5% compared to our prior guidance of 7.5% to 8.5%, driven by stronger operational performance, which more than offsets the negative impact of a depreciating dollar. 2019, we now expect components revenue to be between down 2% to up 2%, compared to our prior year projections of growth of 1% to 5%, driven by a lower demand in China and India. We've raised our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.75% to 16.25%, up from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16.25%, driven by stronger operational performance year-to-date. In Power Systems, revenues are forecast to be down 2% to up 2% unchanged from our prior guidance. We're also maintaining our focus for EBITDA margins, to be in the range of 13.25% to 14%. In the Electrified Power segment, we continue to expect the net expense of $120 million to $150 million, as we continue to make targeted investments and that advance new product development towards commercial launch. The net impact of the changes to individual segment projections is that we now focus total company revenues to be flat in 2019 at the lower end of our previous range of flat to up 4%. Tom said, we are maintaining our forecast for company EBITDA margins to be in the range of 16.25% to 16.75% full year operating cash flow is projected to exceed 10% of sales. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $133 million, bringing our year-to-date, total investment to $242 million, and we still expect our full-year investments to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. In the second quarter we have returned $179 million to shareholders, for the first six months we have returned $458 million through dividends and share repurchase activity. As Tom mentioned our board recently approved a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, which reflects our confidence in the long-term performance and commitment to strong shareholder returns. We expect to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through share repurchase and dividend. To summarize, we delivered a strong second quarter, and record first half of the year in terms of sales EBITDA and operating cash flow. These results extend our track record of improving earnings cycle over cycle, delivering first quarter return on invested capital and enabling us to invest in future growth, while maintaining strong cash returns to shareholders. Now, I'll turn it back over to Tom. Tom Linebarger : Thank you, Mark. As you remember, we announced on April 29th and then discussed in our first quarter earnings call that we'd initiated an internal review of our emissions certification and compliance processes for our pickup truck applications as a result of conversations with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board. Our review continues, and we are proactively working closely with the EPA and CARB and other agencies to address their questions. During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our 2019 pickup truck applications, the agencies raise concerns that certain aspects of our emission systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emission control systems and did not fully comply with the requirements for certification. As a result, our internal review has been largely focused on the agency's concerns. We are working closely with the agencies to enhance our emission systems to improve the effectiveness of our pickup truck applications, and to fully address the agencies requirements and meet the expectations of our customers. Consistent with the values and the history of the company, which include a strong commitment to compliance, we\u2019ll work with regulators and other agencies to address the issues identified in our internal review and develop future technologies that will advance our industry. It's too early to conclude on any changes that we will make to our processes and organization as a result of our internal review. It's also too soon to know what the response of the regulators will be to our view, or to determine any potential financial consequences. Now, let me give it back to James to open for Q&A. James Hopkins : Thanks, Tom. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Michel, we're now ready for our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I guess two questions, one for Mark one for Tom. Mark, just on the change in engine guidance understanding you took your sales down a little -- the margins I guess were down a little lower than what I would have thought, so if you could just help me understand the puts and takes there? And then Tom, a question for you on 2020 understanding you probably want to frame that more, when we get to your Analyst Day or the fourth quarter, but can you just -- given you touched so many markets, can you give us some view on how you're thinking about 2020 given the macro concerns out there, and then any positives and negatives, investors should think about outside of the markets that could help or be a drag on Cummins that are within your control? Thank you. Mark Smith : Okay, Jamie, so quickly the two main drivers of the lower margins for the engine business, lower top-line outlook which in part is due to a kind of leveling off of parts demand in North America, and then of course the lower outlook for joint venture, it is principally driven by China, especially driven by Canada lower outlook for the light duty market, which is really all negative impact the JV earnings which constrict off the EBITDA percent. So those are the two primary reasons otherwise everything else is pretty much in line. Tom Linebarger : And with regard to next year I will just make a few general comments, Jamie and of course we'll be very detailed when we get to the Analyst Day about what we're seeing. But broadly speaking, as you know many of our markets are either at or near cyclical peaks in our view, which means that inevitably we will start to see some of these markets decline. We don't know the exact quarter, we done a fairly detailed projection for the U.S. truck market because there's a lot of data and it\u2019s easier to do. But even that has some variance depending on who in the industry you ask. Most of the other markets have more variance as to when people think they thought but many of them will inevitably fall at least to some degree, so we are prepared for 2020, and even into 2021 for markets to be relatively lower cyclically, at least many of our major ones and we are prepared in the following sense. We are already managing our cost to make sure that our capacity levels and cost levels will be at the right place when it's time and making sure that we're the first to be ready and the first to react. And so, a lot of our focus is on ensuring that were prepared from a cost structure point of view for that cyclical downturn that's how we ensure that in the next downturn we have better margins than the prior downturn. The second thing is that our products are performing incredibly well, that's why you see many of our market share projections sort of tipping towards the higher end of our estimation for the year as because we think our products are performing very well. We think that serves us well in downturns because a few points of market share can make up some cyclical downturn. So, we will continue to emphasize the quality and performance of our products and we will continue to launch new products. So that when we're in downturn, our competitors will see us continues to go from strength to strength because in downturns as well, we also think we can gain market share and commitment from customers. Also, we will be seeing some gain hopefully from the SS6 and NS6, we've been investing significantly in engines and components for those launches and we think we'll be ready. We feel ready now and we think our products will outperform competitors and we think that will give us a chance to step up our market positions in both India and China, which we think will be lasting positions. So those are just some of the puts and takes, again, not all markets will follow the same time, we have a very global market and as you know, not all the cycles of the same, but we are just prepared for cyclical downturns are turning into this mode. It says while this is lower and we're going to make sure our cost structure right and we will gain share from competitors and continue to launch new products in a way that conditions are better for the fall the upturn. Jamie Cook : Thank you. That was helpful. I will get back in queue. Operator : Our question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. On your down 10% earnings from JVs in your guidance. I think that implies around flat for the second half versus down 15% to 20% in the first half that, how much of that is easier comps or is it an expected pickup in sales, emission guidance for something else. Mark Smith : So, I think we will start to see a tail off certainly on a system side of our joint venture earnings towards the back half of the last year, so your method is exactly right, Steve. There is no assumption [ph], it is just kind of leveling out in aggregate and flat in the second half of the year. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then could you just clarify the parts outlook to what extent are you already seeing a lower demand exiting the quarter, I think you had 2% growth disclosed in the distribution segment. So, has that already started to turn negative or are you just adjusting production and anticipation of lower demand later this year and the next year? Rich Freeland : Steven, its Rich. Let me give just a little background on parts, some perspective. We are parts and service business for last three years which has grown about 10% a year, since we put more and more product out there and more complex power trains, we've seen some pretty rapid growth in that. What we forecast about 4% to 5% growth again this year, including pricing and what we've seen is bit of a fall back on that. And mostly in North America as we look to truck utilization, the data is not a strong here, but our hypothesis is that older trucks are not being run as heavily and so therefore our parts and service down a bit. And when that happens, we've seen -- there will be some adjustment, kind of in dealer inventories and adjustment there. We don't think inventories are bloated at this time or excessive. I think just some prudent trimming of inventories is what I would expect to see. Again, this reduction that we put on our forecast basically says we will still be flat to last year. So, at a record levels and so it remains bullish going forward. We're putting out about 1.5 million engines a year, so over the last three years. So those engines move into the parts consuming business. So, we think a little bit of adjustment second half of the year, bullish long term. Steven Fisher : Great, thanks, Rich. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Actually, yeah. My question was on parts, and that that was fantastic color Rich, on the past growth rate, et cetera. Just out of curiosity, I mean, you mentioned it all tickets bloated, how much of your sales goes to non-Cummins, I guess distribution? If you're willing to give that number? And then, do you think is the six-month adjustment? And then, were kind of all clear. Part of the reason I'm asking is just we didn't see this sort of slowdown as you had in pack car, obviously selling to someone markets. Mark Smith : Yes, so I would say, I don't have exact numbers in but more than half, the channels putting split more than half going to through non-OEM channels. So, there is a wide range of customers buying inventory. Tom Linebarger : What Mark is saying is more than half of go through OEM dealer channel versus our own channel. And that's in the truck side. And as you said, the adjustments, the adjustments in parts, they're kind of hard to predict this time. Because there relatively small adjustments in grand scheme of parts inventories, but they can have an effect on a quarter. And we see this every downturn there are some adjustment. And frankly, we're not that good at predicting much quarter it is. So, we're now kind of we were surprised that it was now, but it was. And I think what Rich is saying is that every time we see this, we see it every downturn, it tends not to be lasting very long. Parts is a very stable business, our services business, so, we don't expect it to keep going down, we expect it to level off. And then we expect to see it continue to increase in future quarter. So, we're just trying to be prudent that it seems inevitable in a downturn that dealers will adjust some inventories. And we saw a little bit of that in this second quarter and we expect to see a little bit more of it as we go on second half of the year. But we'll see, right what happens. And like you said, everybody is going to have different circumstances depending on where they're holding inventory, how much they're holding and all that kind of. I think we should just expect variability, but it's inevitable if you just look over the cycle that parts inventory dropped some in the downturn, and then they rise up again as things start to rise. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Tom Linebarger : Hi, Ann. Ann Duignan : Maybe you could walk us through the different regions of your business and comment a little further on which one markets you see as being at peak. I mean, everybody understands North America heavy duty, and maybe the impact that has on components also. But what other end markets do you feel are post peak? Tom Linebarger : In, most of the truck markets are at or near peak. I mean, Brazil is a notable exception, because it's kind of running along the bottom, but most of the others. So, India is already on the way down, China look like it's on the way down. Heavy duty, you talked about, medium duty is holding strong, but it's been up for a while. So, it just, and Europe is the one we are not sure about. But even that showed a little weakness in this last quarter. It's hard to say exactly how much what that means. But we've heard some rumblings out of Europe that some of the truck makers are getting concerned. So, it's sort of hard to find a truck market that doesn't feel peakish, if not already headed down the other side. It looks to us like mining is a little bit of a different story. It doesn't look like it's at peak, but it's definitely leveled off. I mean, there's just nothing else to say about that. Now, whether it's going to turn back up again or just sort of steadily grow we're not sure that's kind of our view is that it's going to have a slow growth from here for a little bit longer, but there's no question that compared to a year ago. It's leveled off. And so that that doesn't look like it's got a whole bunch more left in it. And then I'd say construction markets. U.S. construction markets still strong but at some point, if after the truck market, it feels like construction market has to also tail down and we already think China's got to start tailing down because China has been up for a while and unless they continue to stimulate the market is likely to head down. India, India has got some -- the government has continued to invest and stimulate there, and we think they probably still will. So, India might hold up a little longer on the construction side. But again, that's some of them. But you remember and we show where we kind of put all the markets up there. We'll bring that that to the Analyst Day, and we'll kind of put all the markets on there. But suffice it to say those we look at that there's more kind of up and around the top of the that little hills and then there are at the bottom on their way up. So, we're just being realistic about what that means for revenues in 2020. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate that. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Tom Linebarger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mark Smith : Jerry, hi. Good morning. Jerry Revich : Tom, I'm wondering now that you folks have Isuzu joint venture setup, can you just update us on the market share opportunity for you folks on light duty diesel globally. I'm wondering, if you could flush out what the opportunities set is and what the strategy is now with the joint venture and how it fits in for the company's overall opportunity set. Tom Linebarger : Sure, it's early days in that joint venture, but we're really pleased with our conversations. It's a terrific company, I mean it's not a company that we had done a lot of business with until we started having conversations with them. But although we've always been impressed with them from afar, they we kind of feel like at least in the off-highway market where we see each other, they're the one the engine that we think is actually competitive to ours, and we think highly of them. So anyway, we've had terrific conversations, but we are early days as to kind of what the market share opportunity. But here's how we're thinking about it together, is that the two companies are both spending a lot of investment -- putting a lot of investment into the various technologies that will occupy the commercial industrial equipment space. So, think about not only diesel but natural gas and hybrid and electrification and fuel cells and start to think about what that means. Then they also have a truck business which has to identify -- also has to do autonomous safety, other integration of their vehicle. So, they're thinking about all the investments they need to make in that all the investments they need to make in power train and coming up and thinking that tips us over a company our size. So, but they need to be leading, there's no room for laggards, there is not going to be any second place is there, I mean, they're the strongest truck company in Japan, they have a terrific market share in Southeast Asia and they're the second largest and diesel engine maker with us. So, what we're going to try to do is figure out how we can make sense and rationalize these investments in these various technologies, and it's my sense that they would like to figure out a way to do that, so that Cummins can do a lot of the investments in the power train, and they can focus more investment on the truck. And if they can do that in a way that allows them to ensure supply, make sure they're leading utilize the technology and assets they have, I think that's going to be a solution that they like. But there -- there's a lot of conversations about to have about how you do that. And the reason we think this is really a great opportunity for both companies is if we can figure this out, I think a lot of other OEMs around the world would like to figure out something similar there. There all of us are stuck with the same problem of a lot of investment in new technology for essentially the same markets and essentially the same size, which looks like an equation that again, keeps most of us over unless we can figure out some solutions to either add content and or find new ways to rationalize investment. So, I think it's a really important set of work that we're doing, that could be indicative of how some of the other industry discussions go. Jerry Revich : That's really interesting. And on the shorter-term side, you folks are preemptively looking at markets where demand could be weaker. Can you just update us on your framework for detrimental margin, so the detrimental margins were really in the teams on this revision, which was nice to see, are you optimistic that you can achieve better detrimental than the mid-20s that I believe you\u2019ve targeted in the past? Mark Smith : Well, we will give you a more precise of that in the Analyst, Jerry, as we get a closer view on those markets, but as clear goal of improving cycle-over-cycle earnings, and you're right, yes, in the second half of this year, we will be in the kind of mid-teens, I think we've got to balance that against just some of the investment needs in the near-term on some of the new technologies. So, we'll come out and give you a clear answer, but you should be clear, that we committed to improving those earnings on the down cycle as well as the up. Jerry Revich : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Leiker of Baird. Your line is open. David Leiker : Good morning, everybody. Mark Smith : Thank you, David. David Leiker : I wanted to talk a little bit, how you get a great amount of detail in terms of year-end markets and what you're looking for. I was wondering if we could dig into a little bit further in terms of that pace of production going into the third quarter and fourth quarter. We're hearing different things from different folks that, build rates may hold up through the end of the year. But just you're seeing lower -- you're thinking that daily build rates actually fall as we go through Q4. That something you're thinking that might happen? Are you seeing that in some of the schedule says you look further out towards the end of the year? Rich Freeland : Okay. Hey David, this is Rich. So, a few things. One, we're not seeing it in the short-term schedules, they remain strong. We see out our visibility through Q3. And what we're doing just planning for a scenario, where production begins to fall off as the backlog goes down. And so, we have no visibility to that. We've just seen it in past cycles that some OEMs don't run at this elevated rate, because people are working pretty close to capacity right now. As a backlog comes down, what we've seen in past cycles is people begin, don't run full steam all the way to the backlog is gone. They begin to moderate their production schedules. So, we haven't seen a lot of that, we built that into our guidance, but that will happen in Q4. And of course, there is a scenario where that doesn't happen. And we're prepared for that also. But that's the vision we have is more on what we've seen in past cycles, David. David Leiker : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just one additional item on the balance sheet. The working capital numbers pretty high. It looks like receivables and inventory. Mostly just any thoughts on that and where you think that trends over the second half of the year? Thanks. Mark Smith : I think, when we look at our metrics business. There are pretty similar to where we were last year, our inventory hasn't certainly kind of leveled off in the second quarter. So, I would expect to be in that kind of the 20% of sales range for working capital overall, past dues were in pretty good shape, collections are in good shape. So yes, but to the extent we're facing some weaker outlook then would expect to bring it down. And there would be some positive cash flow impact from that earlier in the downturn. David Leiker : I was looking on the cash flow statement and your pretty significant use of working capital in this quarter versus the same quarter last year? Mark Smith : Yes, that's just Q2 this one of the strongest quarters ramping up from Q1, which I don't see\u2026 David Leiker : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Adam Uhlman : Hi, guys. Good morning. Mark Smith : Good morning, Adam. Adam Uhlman : I had a follow-up on David's question on the cash flow. I guess, the share repurchase has been kind of low so far this year. And you reiterate the plan of returning 75% of the operating cash to shareholders this year. I'm just wondering, if any depending deal activity or potential deal activity could lead to a pause in that share repurchase plan for the second half of the year? Mark Smith : I guess, there are a number of factors that go into share repurchase in any given quarter. But we just restarted our current expectation is we'll get to around 75% of operating cash flow item. I guess there are some scenarios in which that could be a little bit different. Those are not the ones that we see right now for this year. Adam Uhlman : Okay. Got you. And then on the power gen markets, it sounds like the data center demand has been holding up relatively strong. I wonder, if you could talk through what you're seeing with your order rates? Have you seen any kind of -- any softness within the data center market and just how much visibility do you really have on the global gen set market at this time? Rich Freeland : That remains -- that look strong, as far out as we can see. And then the core activity is good. Our hit rate on getting market share on that. So, I mean, the general consensus is, we're not giving 2020 guidance, but that looks strong through the end of the year into next year at least. Tom Linebarger : And the bright spot, Adam has been this China side. One of the things we've always been worried about is how big is the data center market relative to the total, because we've kind of been looking at it as a U.S. and maybe European phenomenon. But now we're seeing starting to see developing countries, especially China, build out data centers and because of our position in that market that had kind of the premium end of the market. We've been actually been able to develop quite good share. And our team in China has done a terrific job ensuring that as these data center markets start to build out that come in since the player that they look to. So, I think, again, that's a big reason why you're seeing continued strength in data centers is that although it's just one segment of the market, we're seeing it build globally. So, it's -- I think that's steadied out the growth and kept it robust for longer. Mark Smith : Yeah, we're seeing a little bit of increase in our military business, and then a little bit of weakness in the all these segments in North America, which has been on a multiyear strong run. So that's feels like it's cycling down a little bit. Adam Uhlman : Great. Thanks. Mark Smith : Thanks, Adam. Operator : Our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to gain comfort with the margins. Obviously, the downside operating leverage which is really critical to the story looking into 2020. So, I'm just trying to understand like say the engine division. If a year ago, we adjust for that campaign charge. We just saw the engine business year-over-year have up sales a little bit, but profits down over $40 million. While the second half of the year, engine business supposed to have revenues down over $200 million, but profits only down about $40 million to $50 million. So just coming off that second quarter performance, it obviously is implying the second half is a lot better, despite somewhat notable sales decline. Can you help build some confidence on what is changing in the second half? I assumed materials, -- I'm just trying to understand after that second quarter, our comfort with the second half margin for engines. Mark Smith : Yes, David, it's Mark. So, I think we've just got some moving parts in some of those different comparisons. So, number one, the first a tougher compound China JV earnings partly due to adjustment in light duty, I think that comp gets a little bit easier in the second half of the year. And then we're lapping with a higher tariff run rate, remember the actual tariff expenses in the first half of the year close to zero. And so, we're just kind of lapping on those higher numbers. And then of course, we're doing relatively well on certainly on the heavy-duty market share. So, I think by and large, there is nothing heroic in the second half of the year, we've taken down our outlook for part, as Tom said, some of the actually weaker outlook are leveling off, maybe a better way to describe it already occurred in the second quarter. So, we're not expecting a significant down shift. For those, I think, are the major moving parts, not a significant amount of change in price, or material cost, first half to second half. David Raso : Yeah, I guess, I pushed back a little bit on the JV income. I mean JV income was down about 10% in engines year-over-year. It seems like the second half is not terribly different, in the context of your overall company JV income for the second half. So, is there some number around the materials or something about mix that we can again, gain comfort that we can handle that biggest sales decline in the second half with ... Mark Smith : That was just really back up to the overall company guidance, we've delivered something like 71% for the full -- for the first half of the year, we're at 16.25% to 16.75%. We've kind to maintain the margin guidance on a slightly weaker revenue outlook. So generally, things are going pretty according to plan on the cost side. So, I've got I think we would what we know today, that's our best guidance, and I don't think there's anything heroic in the numbers. David Raso : I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Smith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Alex Potter : Yeah, hi, guys. If you could comment a bit on the light duty policy changes that you're seeing impact demand in China in the truck markets and the reclassification from light duty to medium duty? Is there -- well, first of all, I guess any qualitative commentary you can offer on that policy would be helpful. But then secondly, is there a reason to think that you could have demand shifting to the medium duty side of the market as a result of this and if so, presumably, the Domfront [ph] joint venture should be able to capitalize on that? Tom Linebarger : Thanks, Alex. Just a couple of qualitative points and I'll let Rich add if he has more. This is the -- if you're in China, they call this the blue-plate issue, you get a blue plate if you're light duty. And if you -- and what this means is you have easier driver licensing requirements. It's closer to a car license, and you can access the very inner parts of the city, you can imagine why that would be a smaller vehicle, lighter vehicles, less congestion, et cetera. And the rules were already in place, it's just that they didn't enforce them quite as tightly in every city, and so now what they've done is they've, just picked the day and all of a sudden enforcement started. To say that it had disruption in the market would be an understatement. So, I, when I was in China recently, there wasn't a single OEM that didn't complain about this, because it just all of a sudden happened and it created absolute havoc in the market. So, my -- I'm wondering, in part, if there'll be some sort of compromise proposal to kind of rationalize this a little bit, because it really takes a lot of vehicles that were previously being sold and used in cities and brings them outside of the city. And again, it's not just the fact that you have to spend more money to get more licenses that you can't actually get into all the spots. So that there's a significant change and the ones that can get in have to be very lightly loaded. And so, you're now you're afraid moving capacity has just reduced significantly. So anyway, there that there's a bunch of that going on, I'd say there's only so much you can figure out about that in China and how fast that's going to move like you know, from your experience. But my sense is that if there's quite a bit of consternation, and there's some -- some potential outcome where things get compromised or rationalized that whether or not this demand moves to medium duty is another question. My feeling is that there's not a lot of movement there. Because really, this is the part that takes the final -- it is the final mile delivery stuff. And most of the larger cities anyway have restrictions on vehicle size, doing that final mile delivery. So, a medium a bigger medium duty truck is not really going to solve your problem. And they maybe don't need so many more of those. But, you know, could be -- there could be some substitution. I think the biggest impact for us was, we got this new JAC JV, we've got Foton going and they're both going gangbusters with great products and great -- great trucks and so it just kind of came to a screeching halt for a second while, this thing is getting rationalized. We think we still have a great line-up in either case, it's just that it, it had a pretty abrupt hit in the second quarter. Alex Potter : Okay, thanks. Thanks very much. That's super helpful. And then I guess one you mentioned the relationship for Foton there, I noticed that you Yuchai just announced the joint venture partnership of some kind with, with Foton, is there a potential for overlap there with what Cummins does? I guess any commentary there would be helpful as well. Tom Linebarger : So I -- here's the situation as you know, each of the OEMs has a number of businesses and another number of segments that they're trying to make sure that they're competitive and, and, you know, they use domestic engines and some of those segments and they use joint venture engines with us in other segments, and then a fair bit of those for export. And so, they always have to have multiple partnerships to cover themselves. Not to mention there are a number of government programs where they need to have domestic engine supply to comply with it. So we are, you know, we're now after, after many, many years there, we're now getting more used to this kind of thing where we, we think we've got the engine thing, good to go. And then all of a sudden, there's another partner in, but again, al-in-all, we still feel very good about our partnership with photon. And Rich, I know has spent some recent time with him, so I want to let Rich comment to on the photon partnership. Rich Freeland : Yes, so I would say our relationship with photon is as good as it's been in recent years. In fact, both relationship there and then the customers view of the Foton Cummins product. So, in fact, our share of Fotons so is up from 46% a year-ago, to in the mid-60s now. And so again, I think it's just as Tom says, the nature of the business there's going to be multiple options, always and so our strategy remains the same to work with the partners develop the best power train product and let customers choose, since we've kind of get used to it there will be customers will have multiple options, but right now I feel really good where we're positioned with Foton. Alex Potter : Okay. Thanks, guys. Tom Linebarger : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First a shorter-term question on 2019 pricing, I believe you've been expecting about an 80-bps growth from pricing and I think a lot of that had to do with the parts business. You know, what are the current expectations, and can you still get that sort of price growth in parts if we're seeing lower activity levels? Mark Smith : I think this puts and takes around the business. But that's round about where we said at the start of the year. So yes, a little bit lower on parts. But overall, we're in that 80 basis points range for the year. Again, the pricing hasn't gone down, just a little bit a little volume gain. Noah Kaye : Okay, that's helpful. And then longer-term I mean that you just formally adopted the CO2 regs, for the first time for heavy duty trucks. You already talked about potential Euro 7. Can you talk a little bit about the potential tailwind there for new components business over the coming years and how you think you are positioned? And maybe even kind of contextualize some of your recent investments, electrification, fuel cells, in light of those red? Tom Linebarger : I think, thanks for that. No, I do think those are just those regs. By the way, those are tough and draconian. There isn't a single OEM that is feeling nonplussed about those. But here's what I say is it they are just -- they are emblematic of what we're going to see across the world. And so, and especially now that regulators have in their sights, some of these new technologies, which look like they have lower, at least local emissions and the potential to potentially be economically viable. Things like of course, electrified power trains, or hybrids, or fuel cells, et cetera. Once they have those in their sights, and they think they can be economically viable, they are going to shove regulations harder, for obvious reasons. And Europe is, of course, one of them. But we will see them inevitably in the U.S. and elsewhere. So, we think that the content - and that's kind of linked back to my conversation, when Jerry asked me about Isuzu. I think all of our customers, and Cummins are all seeing significant investments required in power trains, power train components, and systems. And as well as in vehicles in order to be competitive and at the front end of their markets. Everybody has a good view of what those kinds of might be. But the amount of investment, the number of models that have to be covered, the different regulations that they're going to have to meet cities, countries regions, it looks daunting. So, what we're -- what we think is that that's the space where Cummins has historically been most successful. When that's kind of the technology challenge in front of us, we've made a bunch of investments, as you know, in EV, in hybrid in diesel and natural gas. And if we can complete this transaction with Hydrogenics will also have the beginnings of fuel cell offerings. So, our intent is to have the power train of choice for each of these, these providers, and including providing components in those technologies for them to integrate their own systems. So, we think, again, we will be at the forefront of technology. So, we are talking to every European manufacturer about the role they'd like us to play in their system, and everyone has a different view about that. We're clear that they are the system provider, and we're there to support them technically. And we think as you said it, whenever there is technology change, whenever regulations are challenging, that's the tail when to come in, because that's essentially what we make, that's what we differentiate on. That's where we our meals are made. So, we will invest you will lead there, we will ensure that that we're ready when they're ready to, to use us. And again, a lot of people are wringing their hands, figuring out how they're going to meet all these requirements. And we're just we show up every day and say, we're ready to help let us know what you want us to help. Noah Kaye : Right. And it would seem to me just that in a market where you're providing a lot of subcomponents currently. And you're going into alternative power trains, where not every OEM is going to do a vertically integrated, power train. I mean, they may spec their motors outside or something like that. I mean, there's more of a gain opportunity, it would seem to me at lease. Tom Linebarger : It seems to me too. Although I'm sure there'll be plenty of others that also see that. So, we'll show up with others there too. But I agree with you that it looks like an opportunity to us. We just don't want to get our cart in front of the horse. It's up to our OEMs to announce what they think. But we will be pushing hard to help those OEMs meet that standard with technology and components that we have. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much. Tom Linebarger : Thank you. James Hopkins : Great. So, with that, it looks like we're at the end of our hour. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your interest in Cummins today. And as always, I'll be available for any follow up questions this afternoon. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation, are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger. Thomas Linebarger : Thanks, James. Good morning. I just want to start one correction of James remarks. Retiring Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland, has said he will not be available for questions after the call, unless it's about how cute his grandchildren are or about golf. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2019. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full-year. Revenues for the third quarter of 2019 were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA was $958 million or 16.6% compared to $983 million or 16.5% a year-ago. Positive pricing, lower variable compensation, material cost reduction activities and lower warranty expense partially offset the impact of lower volumes and increased investments in research and engineering. Engine business revenues declined 11% in the third quarter compared to a year-ago. Revenues in North America decreased by 6% as we began to see the impact of OEMs preparing for lower production of heavy-duty trucks in North America, as well as declines in shipments to construction markets. International revenues declined by 25% primarily as a result of lower demand in China light-duty truck and construction markets. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.1% compared to 14.9% for the same period in 2018, and included a $33 million charge related to ending production of our 5-liter ISV engine for the U.S. pickup market. Improved pricing and lower material costs partially offset the impact of lower volumes, reduced joint venture income and the $33 million charge. Sales for our Distribution segment grew by 4% year-over-year driven by higher demand for power generation equipment in North America. Third quarter EBITDA was a record $186 million or 9.3% of sales compared to 8% in the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA margins benefited from higher volumes, positive pricing and lower variable compensation costs. Third quarter revenues for the Component segment declined by 6%, sales in North America increased 2% driven by higher demand in the U.S. pickup market, while revenues in the international markets declined by 18% as a result of lower truck demand in Europe, India and China. EBITDA for the third quarter was $286 million or 17.3% compared to 16.4% in the same quarter a year-ago. The increase in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower warranty costs and the benefit of material cost reduction programs, which offset increased investment and the development of new products to meet advancing emission standards in China and India as well as the impact of lower volumes. Power Systems sales in third quarter increased by 2%. Demand in industrial markets increased 3% with lower sales to oil and gas markets offset by increased sales to marine, rail and mining customers. Power Generation sales increased 8% in North America, driven by continued strength in data center markets, offset by a 4% decline in international markets, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. While sales increased compared to a weak third quarter last year, sales declined 6% sequentially with lower demand in power generation, oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA in the third quarter was 14% compared to 14.7% a year-ago. The decrease in EBITDA percent was largely due to the impact of higher material costs, including tariffs, and lower sales of industrial engines. In the Electrified Power business, EBITDA was a loss of $36 million in the third quarter and in line with our expectations. We completed the acquisition of Hydrogenics, a leading producer of fuel cells and electrolyzers for the production of hydrogen, on September 9. Our third quarter results included $2 million EBITDA loss related to Hydrogenics. Now I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the third quarter of 2019 starting with North America, and then I'll cover some of our largest international markets. Our third quarter revenues in North America were flat at $3.6 billion. Increased sales of power generation equipment, especially the data center customers were offset by lower shipments of heavy-duty truck and construction engines. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks increased 3% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to a year-ago and decreased 4% compared to the second quarter of this year with low truck orders, a declining industry backlog and historically high levels of new truck inventory driving lower industry production. While industry truck production increased compared to last year, our shipments declined as OEMs prepared to ramp down production in Q4. Our market share through September was 32%. Production of medium-duty trucks increased 4% in the third quarter. A growing U.S. economy, coupled with high levels of consumer spending, low unemployment and low interest rates continues to drive demand for medium-duty trucks. Our market share in the medium-duty truck market was 78% through September compared to 81% a year-ago. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased for the third consecutive quarter to over 41,000 units supported by strong demand for the Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks. Engine demand for construction equipment in North America decreased 30% in the third quarter. While non-residential construction spending remains high, we are seeing industry participants take steps to reduce their equipment inventory, which currently stands at a historically high levels. Revenues for power generation grew by 8% due to higher demand in data center markets partially offset by lower sales to recreational vehicle OEMs. Demand for engines in oil and gas markets declined by 86% due to continued low purchases of new fracking equipment. Our international revenues decreased by 8% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to a year-ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 2% over the prior year. Lower demand in construction and light commercial vehicle markets was partially offset by increased demand in medium- and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased 1% compared to a year-ago and was positively impacted by a prebuy of natural gas engines, ahead of the move to NS VI standards. We estimate the impact of this prebuy to be approximately 27,000 units this quarter, increasing market size by 10%. This increase, in addition to the 20,000 unit prebuy that occurred in the second quarter. Our market share improved to 16.1% this quarter from 15.6% a year-ago as we increased our share at Foton and saw a shift towards over-the-road trucks versus construction-related dump trucks. Industry sales of light-duty trucks declined by 3% in the third quarter and 15%, sequentially. Our engine market share was 7.4%, 0.2 percentage points higher than a year-ago. We continue to be impacted by increased enforcement of loading regulations where truck models that has historically been registered as light-duty trucks are now to be classified as medium-duty trucks, which limits access to urban areas and requires additional licensing for drivers. OEMs did begin to launch new light-duty vehicles in the third quarter, resulting in higher industry productions than we had originally forecasted. Third quarter demand for excavators in China increased 16% from a year ago. Our market share also increased from 15% to 15.4% driven by the strong performance of our local partners. While industry sales and our market share increase compared to a year-ago, our sales for the quarter including joint ventures declined 29% due to OEMs and dealers reducing inventory built primarily in the second half of last year. Demand for power generation equipment was flat in the third quarter with lower demand for standby power, partially offset by growth in demand for data center markets. Third quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $344 million, a reduction of 29% in the third quarter a year-ago with lower demand in all of our major end markets. Industry truck sales decreased 52% year-over-year and even larger decline than we'd expected, driven by continued lack of credit availability. Credit availability also started to impact other markets during the third quarter with construction revenues down 75% as companies struggle to finance construction projects, placing pressure on equipment purchases. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on individual regions in end markets. We now expect company revenues to be down 2% for the year compared with our prior guidance of flat. We are lowering our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America. Hopefully, we\u2019re off mute now. Okay. More concerning, the industry backlog declined 31% or 61,000 units [technical difficulty] to 133,000 units from its peak of over 300,000 units a year-ago. Inventory remains elevated at 81,000 units and third quarter orders of 34,000 units were the lowest since 2009. Industry production decreased monthly as we [technical difficultly] third quarter and we expect monthly declines to continue through the end of the year. We expect our market share for the year to be at the low end of our forecast range of 32% to 34%. Market share is being negatively impacted by lower shipments to OEM's ahead of truck production cuts. Demand in our parts and remanufacturing business remain stable in the third quarter. As we continue to see the impact of increased capacity of fleets and lower freight demand resulting in lower utilization of available equipment in the industry. We continue to expect parts demand to be relatively weak through the end of this year as dealers reduced parts inventory and anticipation of lower market activity. In the medium-duty truck market, we're lowering our forecast for industry production to 138,000 units are up 5% compared to our prior guidance of 140,000 units are up 6% year-over-year. While retail sales of medium-duty trucks remained strong, up 13% year-to-date, industry truck production has now been above order intake for seven months, lowering the industry backlog to levels that will result in lower build rates. We continue to expect our market share to be in the range of 74% to 76% unchanged from our prior guidance. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for 2019, compared to a very strong 2018 and unchanged from our expectations three months ago. Shipments of construction engines are now expected to decline 5% compared to our prior expectations of 10% growth as OEMs and dealers reduce inventories from historically high levels. In China, we now expect domestic revenues including joint ventures to be down 1% in 2019 and improvement compared to our prior guidance of down 2%. We are increasing our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand to 1.23 million units or down 7% compared to our prior guidance of down 10% due to the additional prebuy of natural gas trucks that occurred in the third quarter. In the light-duty truck market, we now expect a 7% reduction in demand compared to our prior guidance of down 12%. This improvement is driven by OEMs launching new truck models in light of the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations that began in the second quarter. We expect our market share and the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be in the range of 13% to 14% and in light-duty we expect our market share to be 8% to 9%, both in line with our prior guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators in China to increase 8% from the record levels achieved in 2018, compared to our prior guidance of flat. While industry sales are expected to increase this year, we are expecting lower levels of industry production in the second half of 2019, compared to 2018 as the industry prepares for lower demand in the spring 2020 selling season. In India, we now expect total revenue including joint ventures to be down 20% [technical difficultly] compared to our prior guidance of down 5%. We anticipate \u2013 industry demand for trucks to be 30% lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 compared to our prior guidance of down 17%. We now expect construction demand to decline 40%, compared to our prior outlook of 5% to 10% growth with a lack of financing for construction projects lowering demand for new equipment. Demand for power generation equipment is now expected to be flat compared to 5% to 10% growth. In Brazil, we are now projecting truck production to be flat in [technical difficultly] down from our forecast of 2% growth three months ago. While domestic demand in Brazil continues to increase from levels experience in [technical difficultly] truck production in Brazil for export markets is expected to decline 50% compared to 2018 \u2013 primarily due to weak demand for trucks in Argentina. We continue to project total revenues for Brazil to be down 10% this year. We now expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to be down 10% this year, compared with our prior guidance of down 5%. Demand for new oil and gas engines is now expected to decline 50%, compared with our prior guidance of just down 40%. We now anticipate sales in North America will decline by 85%, compared to our 75% expectations three months ago with lower demand for new equipment in the Permian Basin as well as reduced demand for engine rebuilds. The deterioration in our outlook for North America is partially offset by growing sales [technical difficultly] which have represented 61% of our oil and gas engine sales to-date. Demand from mining engines has moderated [technical difficultly] three months as commodity [technical difficultly] and capital budgets have been cut. We now expect mining engine sales down 7% lower than the prior guidance of down 5%. Demand for power generation equipment increased 2% compared to the low levels experience in the third quarter of last year and declined 3% sequentially [technical difficultly] primarily due to lower demand in India. We now expect full-year revenues to be down 2% compared to our primarily due to lower demand in India. For the full-year growth in data centers is being offset by lower sales of [technical difficultly] lower demand in backup power applications in China and India, and a drop in large prime power applications in Europe. In summary, we are now expecting revenues to be down 2%, for the year lower than our prior guidance of flat. This revenue decline is driven by lower demand and domestic international truck markets, weakness in Indian end markets and lower demand in several off-highway markets. Lower sales reduced joint venture income in India and the acquisition of Hydrogenics will impact our EBITDA for the year, which we now projected at 15.9% to 16.3% of sales, down from our prior guidance of 16.25% to 16.75% of sales. Strong execution across all of our businesses resulted in record revenues being translated into record EBITDA and operating cash flow in the first nine months of this year. Our strong and consistent cash flow generation continues to support our plans, return cash to shareholders and we returned $910 million of cash in third quarter [technical difficultly] 2.9% of outstanding shares. While we were pleased with our operating performance in third quarter, we've been working to prepare the company for what lies ahead in the fourth quarter and in [technical difficultly]. As we have discussed before, several of our end markets have been above replacement level for some time and we are now expecting cyclically reduced demand. Our third quarter revenues declined 7% sequentially and our guidance projects that they would decline another 8% in the fourth quarter. This steep level of decline resulted in a number of actions to align costs with production levels including a recently announced voluntary retirement package in United States, which we [technical difficultly] reduced headcount by 400 to 450 people. We are in the process of making additional structural changes in several areas of the business and we'll continue to drive actions to improve costs. As always, we will capitalize on the downturn period to improve our company and merge as a stronger and more profitable Cummins. We will also maintain our investments in the key [technical difficulty] and product development programs that will ensure leadership and sustainable growth in the future. During the third quarter, we announced new [technical difficulty] powertrains and launched an updated ISX15 engine for the North American heavy-duty truck market. These actions demonstrate our commitment to lead both in alternative powertrain technologies and continue to lead in traditional powertrains. We closed on our acquisition of Hydrogenics, one of the world's premier fuel cell and hydrogen production technology providers in September. Their expertise and innovative approach will strengthen fuel cell capability. This is another step forward as we continue to invest in a broad range of clean, fuel efficient and high-performing products and technologies that will deliver value to customers. [Technical difficulty] who designed manufacturer fuel cell range extenders and announced the partnership with Hyundai to jointly evaluate opportunities to develop and commercialize electric and fuel cell powertrains. While we increase investments on alternative powertrains, we continue to enhance our diesel and natural gas products delivering more fuel efficiency, power and lower emission. At the North American Commercial Vehicle show in Atlanta, we are currently showing our new ISX15 Efficiency Series. [Technical difficulty] an endurance transmission will provide up to 5% improvement in fuel efficiency for [technical difficulty] meeting 2021 greenhouse gas standards one-year early. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the [technical difficulty] for the full-year. Third quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 3% from a year-ago. Sales in North America were flat and international revenues [technical difficulty] 8%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%. Earnings before interest and tax depreciation and amortization were $958 million or 16.6% for the quarter, compared to $993 million or 16.5% of sales a year-ago. EBITDA decreased by $25 million driven by the negative impact of [technical difficulty] reduced joint venture income and [technical difficulty] partially offset by material cost reduction activities, lower warranty and decreased variable compensation expenses. Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 25.9% decreased by $57 million or 20 basis points. Benefits from favorable pricing actions, material cost reductions, lower warranty and variable compensation expenses mitigated the negative impact of lower volumes [technical difficulty] charges incurred to cease production of certain unprofitable product lines and higher tariffs. Our selling, administrative and research costs of $842 million, increased by $9 million year-over-year, driven primarily by new product development in the Engine, Components, and Electrified Power segments, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. Joint venture income declined by $22 million due to weaker demand for light-duty trucks in China and lower truck production in India. Other income of $61 million increased by $34 million, driven primarily by $35 million of gains related to closing out certain derivative contracts associated with the Company's foreign exchange hedging program. Net earnings for the quarter was $622 million or $3.97 per diluted share compared to $692 million or $4.28 from a year-ago. Third quarter results were positively impacted by $23 million or $0.14 per diluted share and discrete tax items and the after-tax gains of $28 million or $0.18 from closing out the foreign exchange hedging contracts I referred to earlier. During the quarter, we also incurred after-tax expenses of $35 million or $0.23 per share related to actions taken to cease development and production of certain products. These actions will benefit future financial performance. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.4%. Excluding discrete tax items, the tax rate was 21.5% in the third quarter and in line with our full-year forecast. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record in flow of $1.1 billion. That's $208 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, we've generated a record $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities, up $955 million from the same period last year, driven by higher earnings and a much slower pace of working capital expansion. I will now comment on our revised guidance for 2019. For the Engine segment, we expect full-year revenues to be down between 5% and 6% compared to our previous guidance of flat at the mid-point. The reduction in sales is driven by declines in heavy-duty engine shipments in North America, weaker demand for construction equipment in North America or India, and the lower outlook for medium-duty truck engines in North America, Europe and Brazil. We revised our forecast for EBITDA margins for the engine business to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.8%, down from our prior guidance of 15% to 15.5%, driven primarily by the impact of lower volumes, weaker joint venture incomes and the costs incurred in the third quarter associated with ending production of one engine platform. For the Distribution segment, we now expect revenues to be up 2% to 3% compared to our previous guidance of 1% to 5%, due to lower sales of construction engines in North America and lower engine rebuild volumes with oil and gas and mining customers. We are raising our outlook for EBITDA margins by 35 basis points to be in the range of 8.4% to 8.8% as continuous solid operating performance and lower variable compensation expense more than offset \u2013 the slightly lower outlook for sales. For 2019, we now expect components revenues to be down between 4% and 5% compared to our prior projection of flat at the mid-point and this decline is \u2013 being driven by reduced truck demand in North America, India, Europe, and Brazil. As a result of the lower sales outlook, we've revised our focus for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.6% to 16.1%, down from our prior guidance of 15.75% to 16.25%. Power Systems revenues are forecast to be down 3% to 4% lower than our previous guidance of flat at the midpoint, due to lower demand for power generation equipment in international markets and weaker demand for engine rebuilds and new engine shipments in mining and oil and gas markets. We're also revising our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 12.5% to 13% down from our prior forecast 13.25% to 14%. In the Electrified Power segment, we now expect a net expense of $145 million at the high-end of our previous guidance range due to the completion of the acquisition of Hydrogenics. The net impacted the changes to Individual segment projections is that we now forecast total company revenues to be down 2% and company EBITDA margins to be between 15.9% and 16.3. This compares to our prior guidance of flat sales and the EBITDA in the range of 16.25% to 16.75%. Full-year operating cash flow is projected to be a record $3 billion due to the strong full-year earnings and lower working capital. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $153 million, bringing our year-to-date total investment to $395 million. We expect our full-year capital investments will be in the range of $700 million unchanged from our prior guidance. In the third quarter, we returned a record $910 million to shareholders. We repurchased 4.6 million shares after a total of $706 million. And for the first nine months, we have returned $1.4 billion through dividends and share repurchase activity. We still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year while maintaining a strong balance sheet. To summarize, we delivered a solid set of results in the third quarter, including record quarterly operating cash flow and in response to a slowing global economy driving weaker demand in a number of our end markets. We have taken a number of actions to reduce costs and address some underperforming parts of our business. Consistent with prior downturns, we will continue to identify additional opportunities to drive efficiency and cost reduction whilst maintaining investment in the products and services that will deliver a stronger future. Finally, I want to remind everyone of our upcoming Analyst Day on November 21 of the New York Stock Exchange. I look forward to seeing you all there. Webcast of our presentation will also be available on our Investor Relations section our website. Thank you for your interest today, your patience with a difficult phone call. Now let me turn it back over to Tom before we move to Q&A. Thomas Linebarger : Mark, with all the challenges we have in fuel cells and electrification, I did not expect to be flooded by a phone. There you have it. Just to conclude our prepared remarks. As you will remember, we announced on April 29 and then discussed in our first and second quarter earning calls that we are initiated an internal review of our emission certification and compliance processes for our pickup truck applications as a result of conversations with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board. Our review continues and we are proactively working with EPA and CARB as well as with the Department of Justice and SEC to address their questions and information requests. During conversations with regulators, they raise concerns that certain aspect of our emission system on the model year 2019 Ram engine may reduce the effectiveness of our emission control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. Based on these discussions, we've developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 Ram 2,500 and 3,500 trucks that has been included on all engines shipped since September. During our discussions, the agencies have asked us to look at other model years and other engines that the primary focus of our review has been the model year 2019 Ram. Consistent with the values and the history of our Company, which include a strong commitment to compliance, we will work with regulators and other agencies to address the issues identified in our internal review and develop future technologies that will advance our industry. We are already making changes to our process and organization structure as a result of our review. However, it's too soon to know what the response of our regulators or agencies will be to our review or to determine any potential financial consequences. Now let me turn it back to James for Q&A. James Hopkins : Great. Thank you, Tom. Out of considerations to everybody on the call to ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up, and if you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. With that operator, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Joseph O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thomas Linebarger : Hi, Joe. Joseph O'Dea: Tom, I'm just curious about kind of what your assessment is of what's currently underway in terms of what we're seeing on slowing demand. I think there are pockets of these end markets that you've been talking about things slowing for at least a couple of quarters now, but whether or not you're seeing this more as we're coming off of a level of very strong demand or whether there's something else at play in terms of kind of how you're thinking about things slowing down here? Thomas Linebarger : Yes. I want Tony to talk more specifically about what happening in the truck market. It'd be a good chance for him to \u2013 he's been very close to it and a good chance for him to talk about that. I would just say that broadly speaking, we've seen a number of our markets been at cyclical peaks over the last couple of years, which has been terrific for the company. We've generated strong earnings and cash flows as a result, but indeed some of those markets are beginning to turn down and we've been seeing signs of that. Typical signs that we're used to reading things like slowing orders, inventory build, et cetera. And now what we're seeing is those things starting to come to fruition. Maybe what's surprising to me is it's broader than I thought. Like we are seeing challenges in India, challenges in China, challenges in \u2013 even in Europe is slowing. We saw North America coming, that was all part of what we expected, but some of the challenges in some of the other markets, how quickly we've seen in the large engine markets sort of peak out and begin to turn the other way has been a little surprising. So maybe that's what's new, not the \u2013 not necessarily that things would turn down, but just how broadly and how quickly they have. And Tony, why don't you just talk about what you're seeing in North America? Tony Satterthwaite : Yes. I would just add \u2013 thanks, Tom. Joe, I would just add, we are definitely seeing \u2013 freight growth has slowed. We are seeing orders slow and production has got to come down to meet \u2013 to match the backlog and meet those orders. And so we are seeing things slow. I agree with Tom. The surprise has been how quickly things have gone bad internationally and that was probably not expected at the beginning of the year. I do believe in North America it is a cyclical downturn. I don't quite know what you mean by anything else other than that, but that's basically what we're seeing. Construction has also slowed down in the U.S., as Tom mentioned in his remarks, which I think is another sign that perhaps it is a broader slowdown than just freight and truck markets. But we've been seeing this coming all year and it\u2019s here. Mark Smith : I guess the other thing I'd add to that, Joe, really, in North America, the pickup truck market is the only one that's been holding out steady and strong through the year. Joseph O'Dea: That's helpful. And then just a cost related question, maybe in the context of what's implied on 4Q EBITDA margins. Can you give any sense of what the impact would be from related cost actions that you're taking right now? So what kind of margin lift you would anticipate if you got the full benefit in the quarter with some of the cost actions underway? Mark Smith : I think you should think about the actions that we're taking is really setting up 2020. The biggest impact will be 2020, by the time we fully executed those actions. And again, we'll give a framework for 2020 at our Analyst Day. We're not going to give specific guidance today, Joe, but our guidance is the results without the cost of those actions. We will call out the customer benefits at the appropriate point in time. What's really driving our margins from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which I think is underlying your question. Number one, it's the significant decline in revenues. That's by far the biggest single impact. Number two, whilst we haven't changed our full-year outlook for warranty or product coverage as a percent of sales is a little bit lower than trend rate in Q3, they\u2019re a little bit higher than the Q3 run rate and Q4 are unchanged for the year. And then the third factor is really that our variable compensation plan is working as designed. So our outlook is lower than our projected payouts, short-term compensation is going down through the third quarter and will move back to more of a normal run rate in the fourth quarter. And really those are the three main factors. So the key now is really talking about the cost reduction initiatives going forward. And again, we'll provide a framework. Tony will add some comments right now. Tony Satterthwaite : Yes. I would just add. We\u2019ve been ready for this all year. We are committed to flexing our costs down with demand. We're committed to managing the cycle. We've been tight on discretionary spending and hiring all year and we actually really started to take things out in the third quarter. We've been analyzing underperforming businesses and as Mark said, we decided to close one in the third quarter, we've launched a voluntary retirement program here in the U.S., and so these are all actions we're taking, the majority of which will bear fruit in 2020, but we are moving now to take out cost as demand drops. Joseph O'Dea: I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Linebarger : Hi, Jerry. Mark Smith : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you can talk about what level of restructuring is embedded in guidance, Mark, just to follow-up on the last question. So in the past, you folks have been able to put up 20% decrementals as you've got production now embedded in guidance, looks like you have restructuring. It sounds like price cost is positive, so can you just help us disaggregate it a bit more? And I appreciate there's a wide range of restructuring actions that can be taken, but what level of core decremental margins are you folks expecting? Mark Smith : Well, we're going to give that core margin kind of framework Jerry in a couple of weeks when we're reviewing with all your peers in New York, so I'll defer that piece. But other than to say that the guidance really does not anticipate. There will be some cost in the fourth quarter associated with further cost reduction activities that Tony has talked about, but most of those benefits and even the benefits of exiting production and some of the products we've exited here, they're going to flow into next year. So we're incurring cost now, but actually even if we ignore the costs we're going to have a year-over-year improvement for those. But again, we'll come back and kind of bundle the overall picture together for you going forward. But as Tony said, we're committed to managing costs, managing well through the down cycle. Thomas Linebarger : And I guess, Jerry, just to talk about decremental margins because we will get into the framework. But as you expect, the decremental margins in the fourth quarter are not where we want them to be. And that's just reflects the typical situation when the market starts falling quickly and we're still spending money on future investments. It doesn't work out in quarter one. And so that's one of the reasons Tony is really focused \u2013 he and his staff on how to take actions right away, so that we're \u2013 as we go into 2020, we bring those decrementals around to what our goals are and you know those as well. So we will be \u2013 as Mark said, we will be showing you the targets we have for the core business, why we're confident that we can hit them and then what are some of the other things in and around that, what are some of our new investments, et cetera, that we\u2019re having to stretch to meet, how that all going to fit together. But needless to say, Q4 is not representing what our goal for our decremental margins is going to be. And that's just because the market is falling fast now and we're still doing the actions that were taken. So it's sort of hard to read core decremental margins from the quarter where all the revenues fall off. Jerry Revich : Sure. I appreciate that. In terms of the light-duty diesel platform for you folks with exiting the 5-liter production here in the U.S., can you give us an update there, you folks finding that there are opportunities to source similar products from elsewhere, maybe the Isuzu joint venture or otherwise because you folks had been looking for light-duty diesel to be potential option value for you folks over the next couple of years. So can you just update us on the decision tree to discontinue production here in the U.S.? Thomas Linebarger : Yes. I think it's \u2013 from a strategic point of view, we still think the light-duty diesel business is a good business for Cummins. And as you said, we are talking to Isuzu about how to cooperate fully across that market. It's a market that requires relatively high volume and scale to be successful. And so that's one of the reasons that we think the opportunities between Cummins and Isuzu are significant. I think one of the things that we recognized with the Nissan-related business, the ISV, is we just didn't reach the scale we needed to reach. And that was a function of the customers and the segments that we\u2019re after. The scale wasn't there. But the scale across the light-duty segment for Cummins is significant. As you know, we have very large scale across our 3.8, 2.8, 4.5 and 6, 6.7-liter engines. We have a global scale, which is unmatched in the industry and that\u2019s of course helping us get good profits, good returns off that engine. And we do expect by the way, electrification in the lower power segments to go faster and that in the higher power segments. Having said that, we think the transition is going to be relatively slow and we think the opportunity to consolidate and earn returns over many, many years to come is there for Cummins and ideally there for the Cummins, Isuzu partnership. So we are investing there and trying to see what we can do to consolidate in the industry in the light-duty segment. It\u2019s just that, with the one \u2013 the ISV, we\u2019re after a certain segment in the U.S., it just didn't appear to offer scale for the engine. Jerry Revich : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Linebarger : You bet, Jerry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew Casey : Good morning and congratulations. Thomas Linebarger : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Casey : Just a couple of clarifications and then a question on China. In the quarter, you'd talked about $35 million charges for the cessation of development and product exit, $33 million of that showed up in engines. Was the remaining two also in engines? Or was that somewhere else? Mark Smith : Components. Andrew Casey : Okay. Thank you, Mark. And then on China \u2013 I\u2019ll come back offline for the other one. On China, you talked about the lack of credit availability, do you see that changing in the near future or in 2020? Mark Smith : The credit availability issue is really in India. And just to kind of maybe provide a little more background, the credit market is supplied by non-bank credit institutions. Sometimes \u2013 in the country, they call it the shadow banking system, but it's these private credit institutions. And they had a couple of bankruptcies in there, in that segment and the market is largely closed, and to the extent it's opened up, prices are very high. So that's what's going up on India. So we do expect it to find its way through as things do in India. We do expect that to mitigate. We just don't think it's mitigating really fast. It's going to take some time because the financial problem, financial crisis not an economic one. So it is a significant issue in the country and there are other economic challenges in India. So we do expect that things are definitely worse than we expected at this time. And we expect some of those things to linger. The opportunity for us remember though, is BS VI is coming. So \u2013 and we are fully prepared for BS VI. Our technology, we believe is leading in the market. We think we have not only a technology, but we also have a cost and scale leadership as well as a service network, which we think is better than competitors. So we do hope to see that this BS VI gives us an opportunity to increase share and increase profitability in India. We just think next couple quarters are going to be rough. That's just the way I'd summarize it. Andrew Casey : Okay. I'll leave it there, and thanks for the correction. Mark Smith : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning and congratulation, Rich. I hope you have a fantastic retirement and thanks for all your help throughout the years. I guess sort of first question, I appreciate the color you guys gave on sort of what impacts the margins going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But I think everyone was also trying to get their arms around just the magnitude of the revenue step-down in the fourth quarter. So I know you talked the markets globally being weaker, but how much of that is just demand versus you guys also making adjustments relative to what your customers are doing sort of on the production cuts size to rightsize inventory? And then I guess my second question, Tom, as you look to 2020, can you sort of talk about cost conversations you're having with customers? Are they sort of reevaluating where their investments are going and how that could potentially be an opportunity for Cummins? And if so, should we think about that is a 2020 opportunity? Thank you. Thomas Linebarger : Great, Jamie. So let me let Tony to talk a little bit about what's happening in North America. And I think it's applicable in some other markets, too, about inventory and inventory corrections. Tony Satterthwaite : Hi, Jamie. This is Tony. We have OEM supply chain where we don't hold a lot of inventory for our OEM customers. We pretty much deliver to their schedule. As they adjust their schedules, they move their inventory around a bit or just their production flow. And we think that's part of the challenge we're seeing in the market today. Those adjustments are making it difficult to kind of pin down exactly what our numbers are going to be versus the market. But we are seeing a little bit of that. I would say none of our OEM customers have significant engine inventory, but there is inventory of trucks in the fields that we see peaked here at the end of September. And so that's just another signal I think that we're going to see demand coming down. The vast majority of the revenue drop into the fourth quarter is from the North American truck side though rather than all the other markets. They are down bit, but it's really North America that's down the most. Thomas Linebarger : And we do expect market share \u2013 our market share to be impacted Jamie to some degree in the fourth quarter as well. I mean it happens every downturn. What happens is that the OEMs basically keep building to fill orders and they slowdown shipments of our engines and they use up their engines more than our engines. We see it, that market share move just as we see it move our way when things start to get busy or in fall. These quarter-to-quarter variations smooth out pretty quickly and we still expect to be in our normal range 32% to 34% or there thereabouts. But in the short-term, we expect we'll see some short-term market share numbers, which are lower just because \u2013 this is just what happens every time. So we expect it at this time too. I think with regard to your question about conversations with OEMs. There is no question that every OEM I talked to is wondering where they want to put their investments. Their decisions are still in front of them for many of them, but they are wondering because they're looking at autonomous vehicle investments. They're looking at, of course, a whole new set of truck ranges, very competitive markets. They're looking at where they want to go internationally and what that takes and what joint ventures and partnerships and they want to do. They're thinking about telematics and other information technology investments. They're thinking about electrification, fuel cells, other CO2 related investments, especially for the European truck makers of CO2 regs are really, really tough. So they just look staring down the barrel of a set of investments that look 2x or 3x their average R&D spend and asking themselves what they want to do. They're mostly making money selling diesel engines today. So the difficulty is, do I keep selling and investing the things that I'm making money today or do I prepare myself for the future where money is going to be made tomorrow? Those are hard set of discussions and we are in discussions with them all the time trying to demonstrate to them that we can help partner with them, take some of those diesel investments off the table. We also of course have electrified powertrains and now fuel cell powertrains to offer them to. But all of this is to say we can take some of those investments and still partner with you, so you can do the rest and succeed in competition. And those conversations are hot and happening all the time. Where they'll come out? We'll see. But there's no question, you can hear in my voice that I think it's an opportunity for us to expand our relationships with OEMs and increase our opportunities to sell more of both traditional powertrains and alternative powertrains. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Ross Gilardi : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thomas Linebarger : Good morning, Ross. Ross Gilardi : Tom, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on how some of your more stable businesses like after market components, distribution and power gen would perform in a downturn. I mean do you think they move sideways or do they actually go down on the aftermarket side or are you seeing much deferred maintenance at this point that's impacting that business? Tony Satterthwaite : Yes. Ross, this is Tony. We expect distribution and our aftermarket business to mostly move sideways in a downturn. It's not perfect, but it does not go through the same cyclical ups and downs as our first-fit business. And we've been growing the aftermarket significantly over the last couple of years. We're seeing a little \u2013 as Tom and Mark said, a little slowdown this year, a little moderation of the growth, but we have strong confidence in the aftermarket, both distribution and the parts businesses are going to look really \u2013 perform really well on the downturn. Thomas Linebarger : And part of that Tony is due to the growing population of Cummins engine out in the field and in a number of end markets, that means we've got to build in pipeline of aftermarket opportunity over time. Mark Smith : Yes. So I think you have that right. We've got some \u2013 we think are going to remain relatively sideways while the others go down. The other thing going on, which you probably saw in the numbers is in the distribution business, especially in North America, there's been still quite a bit of improvement driven from our initial acquisition of all of our North American distributors. We spent the first four years making sure we consolidated, got the right managers in the right place, made sure we held on to customers and let them know that we're a good distribution business and care for customers. And now what we're beginning to do is figure out how to operate those businesses more or like a North American distribution business rather than a bunch of different branches. And so we're beginning to see some improvement in profitability. We'll see where that goes from here, but there's a lot of good plans in that distribution business. So my own view is I'd like to see it do better than sideways because I think there are opportunities for it to do better than sideways during the downturn. But I think Tony has called the aftermarket point just right. We always see a little bit of noise where utilization goes down here or there. We don\u2019t go down a little bit, but we're talking about 5% drops as opposed to 30% or 40% drops. Ross Gilardi : Got it. Thank you. And then just a related follow-up. I mean your biggest customers still seeing in mid single-digit growth for Parts and your Components business is down 6%. I know they're not apples-to-apples and it sounds like most of the weaknesses is international as opposed to North America. But are you losing share in any of your key markets for components and is the model changing at all, particularly with respect to that customer? They're focusing very, very heavily on their distribution business and seem to be stocking more parts from others as well, so just thoughts there? Mark Smith : The best proxy for our overall Parts business is really the Distribution business. The Components business is probably 70% for us fit, Ross. So turbochargers what was going on the new equipment, obviously that's down quite heavily in some of the markets right now. Our underlying Parts business, we're confident in that. That's not the real issue here. Thomas Linebarger : Yes. And by the way, we believe that with OEMs like our customers, them doing well in parts is not a detriment to comments because remember there's a whole group of parts players, secondhand parts players and rebuild parts builders and even people that are bringing in different makes of parts. And so what we are wanting to do is make sure our end customers get real quality parts and they get a good service experience. And if they do that Cummins and our customers grow their market share and we earn good parts revenue. So we earn good parts of margin selling through our OEM channels just as we do sell in through our own channel. So from our point of view, just gaining share in the market through our customers and through us all looks like a win to us in terms of both revenue growth and profit growth. So for us, them \u2013 our customers gaining share is not a bad thing, but a good thing. Ross Gilardi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Joel Tiss with BMO. Joel Tiss : Hey, guys. How is it going? Thomas Linebarger : Hi, Joel. Joel Tiss : I just wondered if you can talk a little bit about power gen. The revenues were up a little bit. You guys have been working on that business for four years or five years to lower the cost. And just any color on why the margins are under pressure there? Thomas Linebarger : Joel, I'd love to throw that one to Tony, but probably isn't very yet. I'll give them a quarter or two. But no, you hit it on the head. I mean we're not where we want to be on the power gen business. The good news, of course, overwhelmingly been data centers. The data center business has continued to grow. We keep expecting it maybe to be built out, but it just turns out not to be. We're continuing to see more data center business. And of course, we've now got the Asian section of data center business also growing, which is, which gives kind of a second kick to the data center business. The basic standby business has not been good for some time. It's not that there isn't any, there is. It's a big business and it doesn't \u2013 it's a lot of business for our distribution system, but it hasn't been growing. It hasn't really recovered in any significant way. And we saw a little bit of recovery earlier this year and thought, well finally, and then it kind of tailed off. And then of course we had \u2013 we've had a couple of really bad areas like the Middle East has been really bad for a while, but I've just kind of pulled the life out of whatever growth we did see. So we're not exactly sure what that means about the market. We have a lot of market data about it and trying to understand what the future trend is. I mean, we understand what the past is really well, what the future trend looks like. It's hard to see, but it looks like, broadly speaking that energy demand while still increasing is increasing at a rate that's slower than energy capacity build. And that's mostly because while there's been growth since the downturn in 2008 and 2009, its growth has been relatively modest and infrastructure has kept up as compared to the high growth we saw especially in developing countries in the decade before. That said, we got a lot more work to do. It's still a profitable business for us and good returns, especially when you consider the fact we've got a distribution part to it, plus we've got all the industrial business engines that come from it, but we want it to be more profitable and we're disappointed with where we are. There's just nothing else to say about that. Joel Tiss : Okay. And then so Tony doesn't feel left out. Can you give us your kind of best shot at, if you think the underlying demand for transportation is enough to absorb all the excess capacity that's in the channel now, by the time we exit 2021? Tony Satterthwaite : That's a tough question. I probably was better prepared to answer the power gen, and this was given I ran that business quite a few years. That's a great question. And I don't think I have a good answer to be honest. I don't really have a strong view of that yet. So maybe in a very unfair thing, I'll see if Rich wants to have a shot. Joel Tiss : Yes, that\u2019s one of his babies. Thomas Linebarger : He's going to bring out the pictures of his grandkids first, but then he'll answer the\u2026 Richard Freeland : Just play back one more time, Joel. Joel Tiss : The growth in transportation demand, the way you guys see it is enough that by the end of 2021, it can absorb all the excess capacity that we're seeing in the channel right now. Richard Freeland : Okay. Yes, I mean I think so and what you have Joel, you know, when lead times get long, the order boards actually get over inflated because people are wanting to get, build slots and all that. And right now I think actually it's underrepresented what the demand is because I think \u2013 I mean what the future demand is. So like I talked to fleets, they're not putting orders in right now because they're saying lead time is low, I can put it in later, I can delay that. But eventually the trucks run and they need to be replaced. And so I just think we're going to have our normal shake out over a few quarters and then kind of get the backlog cleared out and the orders will begin to come back in. Thomas Linebarger : And maybe just a little historical protective, Joel because it's always hard when you're here at the floor to figure out when does it all get right. But historically, you'd say what \u2013 I mean, you'd say in four quarters the market will be back. Again, there maybe something unique about this, but it isn't obvious that there is something unique. So we'd expect by the end of the year that we would indeed have absorbed whatever there is. There's one other trend underlying. You've probably seen this, but people like the new engines and trucks, they're seeing much better performance reliability out of new engines and trucks. So I think anything that's older than 2017 you're going to see no matter how, whatever we are in the cycle, people are going to want to switch out those trucks and engines just because they're getting such lower operating costs out of the newer engines and trucks. That'll be a little bit of a boost, I think as we start to get out to the back half of the year. James Hopkins : Okay. I think we've got time for one more last question. Operator : Okay. Our next question will come from David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : All right. Thank you. Thomas Linebarger : You slipped in David. Way to go. David Raso : I have a question about the JV income, really a clarification, but then I want to talk to the markets real quickly. I apologize with the phone cutting out, maybe I missed it. The JV incomes implied bouncing back in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Is that related to some of the emerging markets and how you're handling the upcoming emission standards? I'm just curious why it bounces back from $68 million to implied $79 million in the fourth quarter? James Hopkins : Yes. Hey, Ross, this is James. So there's a couple of little things go on from the third to the fourth quarter, so most of the markets are relatively stable as we go from Q3 to Q4. China gets a little bit better than some of the on highway markets, like commercial vehicles starts popping up just a little bit as well. And so you've got a couple of positive things going in the right direction there. But it's a relatively modest on both from Q3 to Q4 in the grand scheme of things. David Raso : But I was trying to think about is what you're implying about 2020 to have that bounce back because in the quarter the royalty and interest income really dropped down as just wasn't sure what was going on there. So we'll talk offline. What I wanted to ask about particular though, outside of North America truck and obviously Tom, you have great insight from your customers and markets, what they're telling you, different players do different things and getting ahead of the curve behind the curve outside of North America truck. Can you just take me around the horn quickly on which markets do you think what you're hearing from your customers? They're actually getting ahead of the curve on taking production down to almost leading things out by the end of the year, which ones are so clearly behind the curve and which ones look about just right. Just we'll get some level set on various geographies and end markets going into\u2026? James Hopkins : Yes. Let's start with China. So clearly in China, the construction guys overbuilt, in the second half of 2018 thinking they're going to have a great 2019. They overbuilt and they're clearly behind the curve, right. You saw that \u2013 you heard the numbers, like the markets up and we're down a pile and that's just because they're just selling dealer inventory and their own manufactured inventory, so that that's for sure. It won't take very many quarters before they're caught up, but they're in not at that stronger market, so it's stronger than we thought it would be today, but it's not so strong. So we're hopeful they'll catch up in a few quarters. But again, it just really depends on end markets. I think truck markets a little bit better than we thought. I think people are pretty much caught up. Nobody's really far ahead. The only thing as you heard was there some prebuy done, which means they'll have some inventory, but it's mostly in gas. It's pretty small markets I'd say. China, we got the construction markets to catch up and they're behind and the truck market's kind of on. In India, it's just \u2013 we just got the rug pulled out. The whole finance thing means it's all underwrite. There's nobody carrying a bunch of inventory or anything. There are some, but that's not the big problem. The big problem is the demands all completely flatness back. So there's really, I mean who's behind the head is kind of the side story. In Europe by the way is straight on. So Europe has got no big challenges in inventory a little bit here and there, but generally speaking, Europe has kind of moved from pretty good, okay, they're not \u2013 it's not a disaster. It's just, okay. And I see pretty quickly everybody's adjusting hourly rates in Europe. I was just talking to a bunch of the OEMs they're all adjusting down. Everybody's making the adjustments. There'll be down to the right numbers in a quarter or two. So I'd say that's right. On the mining side, they adjusted super quickly. I mean, in my opinion too quickly maybe, but mining is not a disaster or anything. It just rose up and it kind of leveled out pretty quickly and they're not overbuying and for obvious reasons they already did and it's bad. So mining is one where I don't think we have a lot of \u2013 they're on plan. In fact, maybe keeping costs lower than they would have in the past segments. And then Latin America, I guess broadly speaking, things aren't very strong. We thought Brazil would be better than it is. And the big issue has been export markets. The domestic demand is about where we thought, it's up a few percent in GDP. I mean, and then underlying demands up. But the export market, because Argentina is a big wreck. And frankly all around, Latin America what you're having is used to be Brazil was the problem. Now you got every other economy is a problem. And so there is a little inventory there, but the numbers have been so low that it's nothing to worry about. So I guess the only place I'm really worried about is China construction with regard to inventory and we're already reporting those numbers thereof. And in North America, Tony talked about this, but there'll be a couple of quarters where our market share will fall while they use their own engines and get all those, get their truck production down and get everything leveled out. But then it will be right back to normal. Mark Smith : And then just a smaller market, but marine feels like it's on a bit of an opportunity\u2026 David Raso : Is there a pick up in marine or is it production just getting back in line with a flat business? Mark Smith : Yes. I think demand is picking up. Thomas Linebarger : Demand is picking up a little. Again, it's in a weak set of markets. It's just that it started, came off the bottom basically. David Raso : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thomas Linebarger : Thank you, David. Mark Smith : Thank you, David. Thomas Linebarger : Thank you. Bye-bye. Tony Satterthwaite : So thank you, everybody. Mark Smith : Yes. Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir. Todd Chirillo : Thank you Catherine. Good morning everyone and welcome to Meritor\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President, and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today\u2019s call are available at meritor.com. We\u2019ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you\u2019ll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay. Jay Craig : Thanks Todd and good morning. We appreciate you joining us today for a look at our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Let\u2019s go to Slide 3. Our performance this year was excellent. You can see we have consistently delivered meaningful improvement over the past three years. Since launching M2019, revenue was up 25%, adjusted EBITDA margin has expanded by 25% or 240 basis points, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is up 140%.  In a moment, I want to highlight some of our achievements during M2019, but first let me make a few comments about this past year. We saw commercial vehicle volumes at peak levels, closing out the year at 359.000 units, up 17% year-over-year, the highest market in 13 years. Production at that level requires nothing short of highly orchestrated cross-functional and regional coordination to ensure customer requirements are fulfilled. I am proud to say that despite the stress this level of production puts on the entire supply chain, our delivery performance was greater than 99% for the total company and our quality score was 108 parts per million. If we excluded an issue that arose in one facility this year, our quality would have been an impressive 24 parts per million.  I am pleased to tell you that we achieved an overall total recordable safety case rate of 0.59 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. This safety rate required significant diligence by all of our employees during this time frame.  In addition to the great effort required to manage the peak efficiently and convert on the increased revenue, we also completed the acquisition of AxleTech, made incredible progress in our electrified drive train offerings, and launched several new products in core and adjacent markets. We also recently announced that Steve Beringhause, CTO of Sensata Technologies, will join our board of directors. Steve\u2019s background and expertise in the application of advanced technology for the transportation industry make him an excellent addition. We are pleased that he has agreed to join us as we begin M2022. Now let\u2019s talk about the highlights of M2019 performance. On Slide 4, we scorecard our financial results against targets. We had more than $600 million in revenue outperformance or 16%, driven by new business around the world, including adjacent markets and revenue from our three most recent acquisitions. As a result of our high performance during the peak cycle, we were also able to gain rear axle share with customers in North America. Not only did we beat our adjusted diluted EPS target, we almost exceeded it by $1 per share, increasing it by $2.23 from 2015. You will remember this was an aggressive goal when we announced it at the end of fiscal year 2015. At that time, we said we believed an 80% improvement in adjusted EPS was the ultimate measure of success for M2019. We actually delivered 140% improvement. Our third financial target was to achieve 1.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the financing associated with the AxleTech acquisition, we achieved 1.3 times or 1.6 times if we include it. We generated strong free cash flow over the term of the plan that reduced legacy liabilities. Let\u2019s go to Slide 5 for a summary of our capital allocation strategy. As I mentioned, we are now generating strong free cash flow and are returning a significant percentage to Meritor\u2019s shareholders. During M2019, we returned $276 million of cash to shareholders through equity repurchases, which represents 56% of our free cash flow since fiscal year 2016. That is more than double the target we established of returning 25% in that time frame. We intend to maintain an aggressive rate of share repurchases during the M2022 time frame.  We told you at analyst day last December that our cash generation and the ability to deploy that cash to drive shareholder value is a critical underpinning of our next strategy. This is where we expect to drive tremendous value for our shareholders. We will provide more detail later in the discussion. Slide 6 provides a summary of strategic transactions. We completed three acquisitions that diversify our revenue streams to help us offset the cyclicality of the line haul markets. These acquisitions expanded our portfolio and customer base with new technology and products in off highway, severe service, and defense. AxleTech is the most recent acquisition that we completed in July. We still expect annual run rate synergies from AxleTech to be more than $15 million by 2022. Our integration process is moving along well and our belief in the strategic value of this transaction has been reinforced in the past several months. As you know, we sold our interest in the former Meritor WABCO joint venture in 2017 and recently announced that we have exercised our option to terminate the exclusive aftermarket distribution arrangement. Under the terms of this agreement, WABCO will pay us between $225 million and $265 million, which provides further flexibility for capital allocation.  Finally, our investment in TransPower has served as an accelerant for many of the electric programs we have with major OEMs. We look forward to our continued collaboration as customers show increasing interest in electric drive train solutions for a range of applications. Slide 7 shows a few examples of the 21 products we have launched during M2019 for a variety of applications. Our current launch cycle is one of the most aggressive in the company\u2019s history. New products include front and rear axles for medium and heavy applications, line haul, construction, buses and trailers, in addition to an optimized air disc brake and a transfer case for the medium duty all-wheel drive market.  Moving to Slide 8, you see that new business accounted for 16% of our revenue outperformance, largely driven by new product offerings. We are designing and manufacturing for a wide range of applications and end markets, and our efforts to grow our business in these areas is gaining traction and will continue under M2022. Slide 9 reflects our efforts to position the company as a market leader in electrified drive train solutions. During M2019, we introduced Blue Horizon, which consolidates Meritor\u2019s advanced solutions under a single brand, reflecting more than 20 years of technology leadership. In the past two years alone, we have progressed through a third generation of the 14XE and are delivering preproduction samples to major customers. We have accumulated thousands of testing miles across a range of applications and duty cycles. We have been awarded 22 e-mobility programs and expect to deploy over 130 vehicles by the end of 2020 in addition to the electric vehicles Volkswagen in Brazil will launch over the next few years. This program award, which we announced at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show, for 1,600 trucks will begin with the OEM\u2019s 11-ton e-delivery truck equipped with Meritor\u2019s 12X with e-optimized gearing and will be substituted with our 12XE electric power train as it becomes commercially available.  We also announced at NACV the introduction of two new e-axles, one for medium and the other for heavy duty applications. With the addition of these two new axles, we believe Meritor now has the most comprehensive e-axle portfolio for medium and heavy duty trucks of anyone in the world. With that, I will turn it over to Carl for more detail on the financials. Carl Anderson : Thanks Jay, and good morning. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll review our 2019 financial performance along with our fourth quarter segment results. I will then provide you with an overview of our fiscal year 2020 guidance. Overall, we had another outstanding year of financial performance and we successfully completed our M2019 plan that we committed to almost four years ago. In the last year of the plan, we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, increased adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.82, generated $153 million of free cash flow, and deployed over 60% of our free cash flow to repurchase $95 million of common stock. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10, where you\u2019ll see our full year financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were up $210 million from last year driven by higher North American truck production, increased aftermarket industrial and trailer volumes across North America, and continued revenue outperformance. From a segment perspective, we saw the largest increase in revenue from our aftermarket, industrial and trailer segment, which was up $137 million from the prior year. We benefited from a strong all-wheel drive market, the launch of the first ever gear driven transfer case for Navistar, and a 7% increase in trailer production. The commercial truck segment was up $80 million in revenue. In North America, Class 8 truck production was up 17% from the prior year. We also saw strong demand in medium duty, increasing almost 10% to 288,000 units driven by demand for last mile deliveries. In fact, our revenue since 2017 in North America truck has grown by over 50% compared to growth of 35% for the combined heavy and medium duty market. We were however negatively impacted by lower sales in both India and China. In India, the pending implementation of a new emissions standard significantly impacted sales in the back half of the year. In China, we have seen a slowdown in the economy which significantly impacted sales in our fourth quarter. For the full year, China\u2019s revenue was $165 million, down 18% from our expectations when we started the year. The overall increase in revenue was partially offset by an approximately $100 million unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies.  Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see on the line labeled volume performance, mix and other, we had $51 million of higher adjusted EBITDA on $306 million of revenue increase. That translates to net underlying conversion of approximately 17%, which we view as a very good result in markets like these as we were faced with higher layer capacity and net steel costs as well as other inefficiencies, primarily in the North America truck market.  Additionally, as we compare 2019 results to the previous year, we had a one-time $9 million environmental charge related to a legacy site which occurred in 2018 and did not repeat. Given the FX headwinds in the year, adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $14 million. These items provide the walk to our adjusted EBITDA of $520 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%. In the table on the left, you can see that our operating performance drove an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations to $330 million or $3.82 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. In addition to the higher overall adjusted EBITDA generated this year, we also had a lower tax expense. Our effective tax rate was approximately 9%, which is lower than the 13% rate we saw last year as we benefited from a higher percentage of earnings coming from jurisdictions which have net operating losses or tax credits to offset taxable income. Finally, due to our continued focus on capital allocation, we had approximately 5 million less diluted average common shares outstanding, which drove about $0.20 of adjusted diluted EPS. All of these items allowed us to exceed our M2019 target of $2.84 of adjusted earnings per share by almost a full dollar. Additionally, on a GAAP basis we recognized approximately $8 million related to restructuring. This was primarily driven by costs incurred as a result of the $20 million restructuring plan announced in September to reduce hourly and salaried headcount globally in anticipation of market declines. We expect the remainder of the restructuring costs to be incurred in fiscal year 2020. We also recognized a $9 million charge to impair certain customer relationship intangible assets related to the AA gear business we acquired last year.  Finally, we generated $153 million of free cash flow in 2019. This is inclusive of the $50 million cash contribution we made as part of the bankruptcy reorganization for the non-operating entity, Maremont, that was completed in July. Exclusive of this transaction, we generated $203 million of free cash flow, a $56 million increase from the prior year. Slide 11 details our fourth quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck segment, sales were $728 million, down 11% from last year. The decrease in sales was driven by lower production in India, Europe and China. While segment adjusted EBITDA was $69 million, down 7%, our segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck increased 40 basis points over the same period last year. As we previously discussed, higher costs associated with record markets in North America began to abate in the third quarter, and this quarter\u2019s results continued this trend. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by lower net steel premium and freight costs and material performance, which more than offset the impact from lower revenue. In our aftermarket trailer and industrial segment, sales were $31 million, up 11% from the same period last year. This was driven by the inclusion of revenue from AxleTech. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $44 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 80 basis points compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the consolidation of AxleTech. We expect this acquisition to be decretive to margins through the end of the calendar year as certain targeted synergies, primarily from the elimination of cost overlap, have not yet been fully realized. Next, I\u2019ll review our fiscal year 2020 market outlook on Slide 12. In the North America Class 8 market, we are projecting production levels between 240,000 to 250,000 units. Fundamentally, this is due to continued lower order intake over the past several quarters combined with higher current dealer inventory, which is driving the step-down we are seeing for production in 2020. As we look to our other markets, we anticipate that Europe will be in the range of 450,000 to 460,000 units, down approximately 6% from last year. Overall economic conditions are pointing to a modest slowdown in 2020 following several years of strong truck markets in Europe. Moving to India, we are seeing the continued impact of the transition to the BS6 emission standard along with continued liquidity constraints in the credit market. Ahead of the April 1, 2020 deadline when all new vehicles registered must comply with the new regulations, we expect significant headwinds impacting the first half of our fiscal year compared to the prior year. The impact of BS6 should abate in the second half of our fiscal year as we pass the implementation deadline. Overall for the full year, we believe the market will contract and be in the range of 330,000 to 350,000 trucks, down approximately 17% from last year. Also, while we have not included China on our outlook slide, I did want to briefly discuss this market. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen a significant economic slowdown in the region which is impacting the off-highway market where we compete. As a result, we expect our sales in China to be down approximately 35%, which is between $55 million and $65 million from the previous fiscal year. On Slide 13, I\u2019ll review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2020. Our forecast for sales is expected to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. We are projecting most of our markets to be lower in 2020. The call-out box to the right walks to this number from our 2019 actuals. We expect lower global markets to reduce revenue between $625 million to $725 million. We are also seeing continued headwinds from foreign exchange, which we estimate to be the in range of $50 million to $75 million. Additionally, we anticipate terminating the WABCO aftermarket distribution agreement in the second quarter of our fiscal year, resulting in an approximately $75 million revenue headwind in the second half of the year. Offsetting the impact of global markets and the WABCO distribution transaction will be a full year of revenue from AxleTech. Moving back to the table on the left, we forecast that our adjusted EBITDA margin will be in the range of 11% to 11.2%. As you can see in the call-out box, we expect our operating performance, lower net steel prices and layer capacity costs to significantly offset declining markets. Additionally, we expect an approximately 20 basis point impact from the termination of the WABCO aftermarket distribution agreement. We are also planning to double our investment in electrification in 2020 given the significant opportunities we are seeing in the market. This does result in a 30 basis point margin impact as compared to last year. Overall, our downside conversion, even including the increase investments in electrification and termination of the distribution agreement, is approximately 16%, which is well within our typical downside conversion rate of 15% to 20%. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, we expect 2020 to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which does include the impact of our share repurchase plan that Jay will discuss coming up. Additionally, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of around 15%, consistent with the M2022 planning guidance we previously provided. Finally, we expect to generate $165 million to $175 million of free cash flow, an increase of $10 million to $20 million from last year. This increase will be driven by the one-time funding of the Maremont trust not repeating in 2020, and improvements in working capital due to market normalization. Based on this, we expect to achieve our M2022 target of 75% free cash flow conversion in the first year of our new three-year plan. From a financial perspective, the bottom line is this : we delivered and achieved the second consecutive three-year strategy with M2019, and even as global markets are softening, we expect to deliver solid results in 2020, continue our investments in electrification, and aggressively deploy capital as we pivot to M2022.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jay. Jay Craig : Thanks Carl. Let\u2019s look at Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we highlight the competencies we have demonstrated during M2019 from strategic transactions, product launches and new business awards to our exceptional operational management through the peak Class 8 cycle and global market upturn. These competencies have positioned us well for M2022. We have shown that we have the ability to flex the organization up or down as needed to adjust for major fluctuations in production. We have diversified outside of the Class 8 line haul market in North America by growing our business in adjacent markets. We have improved our balance sheet and set in motion a capital allocation plan that is returning value directly to our shareholders. The transformation we have undertaken since we launched M2016 has been dramatic and will allow us to effectively manage even the most negative economic environments profitably. For example, our modeling indicates that even if the North America Class 8 market were to decline to a level of 215,000 units and Europe to 400,000 units, we would expect to generate $3.5 billion in sales and maintain a 10.5% EBITDA margin. We also would expect to generate $120 million of free cash flow in this type of environment while maintaining our investments in increased productivity and new advanced product capabilities. Therefore, we fully anticipate that our earnings and cash flow will ensure our ability to take advantage of future capital allocation opportunities that we have established under our M2022 plan. Let\u2019s go to Slide 15. As Carl indicated, our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for fiscal year 2020 is in the range of 11% to 11.2%. Our M2022 target is 12.5%. We have demonstrated our ability to improve adjusted EBITDA margin during each of the last two plans. Through continued focus on material costs, labor and burden, along with execution of synergies from the AxleTech acquisition and additional new business wins, we expect to achieve the 12.5% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2022.  Let\u2019s take a minute to discuss our M2022 capital allocation strategy, as shown on Slide 16. Our board of directors recently increased our current $250 million share repurchase authorization to $325 million, which we intend to fully utilize in 2020. We have already repurchased $60 million of shares in October in addition to the $25 million executed in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are planning to repurchase another $240 million in the remainder of fiscal 2020. The adjusted diluted EPS guidance that Carl referenced for the year includes the impact of these anticipated repurchases. Given our free cash flow expectations going forward, we also have an opportunity to utilize another $400 million for future repurchases in 2021 and 2022.  We strongly believe that we have a significant opportunity to aggressively deploy capital to take advantage of current market prices in our equity, therefore we plan to continue and in fact accelerate our commitment to share repurchases. We will execute this plan through strategically timed open market purchases. We are also committed to strong credit profile and retaining flexibility to invest for the long term. We intend to hold leverage in a similar range through the three-year period. The company retains a significant liquidity buffer should additional investment opportunities, internal or external, present themselves over the coming years. Moving to the last slide, we look forward to the future as we ramp up for M2022. In every area of the company, we are executing well due to the talented dedication we have around the world. I want to recognize our employees in every region of the world for their role in what Meritor has become. Each one of our 9,000 employees is responsible for our success.  We also have excellent relationships with our customers, suppliers and investors. Over the past month, our management team has worked with one of our largest long-term shareholders, Glenview Capital, who has provided input on our capital allocation plans which are fully aligned with our M2022 strategy. We appreciate the support and feedback from them and all of our long term owners as we drive performance for our customers, opportunities for our employees, and value for our shareholders. Now let\u2019s take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from James Picariello with Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hey, good morning guys. Jay Craig : Morning James. James Picariello : Just digging in on commercial truck and the expectations around the decremental margins for the year, this fourth quarter decrementals came in as promised - you know, solidly at 10%. It does sound like you plan to almost double your electrification spend. Just wondering the cadence of the year and maybe just the timing on the electrification spend, if there is any lumpiness there. Carl Anderson : Yes James, it\u2019s Carl. Good morning. I think as it relates to electrification, I think as you look at the planned spending on that, it\u2019s relatively ratable each quarter as we go forward in 2020. Then in the commercial truck segment, if you look at where the margin performance and some of the tailwinds we had in the fourth quarter as it related to lower steel costs as well as freight cost and layer capacity costs, that will be offset by obviously just the lower revenue volumes as well as we go forward. James Picariello : Got it. Then thinking about your other segment, the decrementals in this fourth quarter were pretty elevated. Just wondering what might be one-time related or what\u2019s the favorable offset into next year related to the AxleTech synergy pull-through, and just your thoughts again on decrementals for that segment as we think about next year. Carl Anderson : Yes James, if you look at the performance and margin, actually it\u2019s all really attributable to AxleTech, so if you were to strip out the AxleTech revenue, margin performance would have been very similar on a year-over-year basis within the quarter. As we said in the prepared remarks, we think AxleTech, we\u2019re right in the process of continuing to execute on the various synergies that we outlined previously, and we fully expect as we get out of the first quarter that that will be more in line with our expectations as we get into Q2 and beyond. James Picariello : What was the AxleTech contribution, revenue contribution in the quarter? Carl Anderson : It was right around $30 million. James Picariello : Okay, thanks guys. Carl Anderson : Thanks James. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Jason Stuhldreher : Hi, this is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. Going to the guidance quickly, if I look at the revenue guidance, end markets are guided for a little more conservative potentially than third party estimates, which I think is fine. I guess I was looking at any potential for revenue outperformance in 2020, and I know the key tenets of the M2022 plan was some pretty significant, at least $300 million or so of revenue outperformance driven by new wins. Just wondering if we\u2019re seeing any of that in that global markets bucket, or if the cadence of that outperformance is maybe a little more back end weighted. Jay Craig : Thanks for the question, Jason. This is Jay. I think first of all, we\u2019re seeing the full year benefit of AxleTech revenue, which again we included in our new revenue targets, so you\u2019re seeing that benefit flow through. I think we are expecting some significant downturns around the globe, and I know that\u2019s difficult at times for people analyzing us from outside the company because of how global we are. We\u2019re also looking to hold the vast majority of our North American Class 8 penetration increase at or above 7 out of 10 trucks now running on our axles in the Class 8 market, so we\u2019re continuing to see revenue outperformance but these step-downs in some of our markets, particularly in China off-highway, some of our contractual return obligations for declining steel prices and productivity, tamped down that a bit, but we\u2019re still continuing to bring on new business that\u2019s increasing penetration as well. Jason Stuhldreher : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then just secondly, as we think about steel costs next year, which I know was guided to be a tailwind and is sort of within that first bucket you mentioned, offset by lower layer capacity costs, steel costs, just wondering if you can help us--you know, if we assume the indices and the prices stay flat from here, I was wondering if you could help us with maybe the cadence of the steel tailwinds next year, because I know it\u2019s a little complicated with any sort of escalation clauses and pass-through clauses you have with customers. So, should we assume tailwinds are sort of evenly spread throughout the quarters next year, or is there any strange cadence we should be aware of? Carl Anderson : I think on steel, most of it will be in the first half as we expect kind of the tailwinds from that. As we\u2019ve assessed it, it\u2019s probably high-single-digit millions is what our expectations is for the tailwind in 2020 as you compare to \u201919. Jason Stuhldreher : Okay, understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. One moment while questions queue up.  I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Todd Chirillo for any closing remarks. Todd Chirillo : Thank you. This concludes our fourth quarter call. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions. Thank you very much for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Jay Craig : Thanks Todd. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first quarter and have a number of highlights we would like to share with you today. Let's look at Slide 3, which provides an overview. I am especially pleased that we continue to perform well despite production volumes being down year-over-year in most of our global end markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9% and we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64. As markets have weakened, we have taken steps to manage cost and maintain a downside conversion of 15% which is at the lower end of our expected range of 15% to 20%. We are effectively managing what we can control considering the cyclical nature of our business and the rapid declines in virtually all of global end markets, continuing our track record of operational excellence. In the first several months of the fiscal year, we continued to execute our share repurchase program, finalized a meaningful new electrification agreement with Paccar, were added to the S&P 600 small-cap index, enhanced our technology and product portfolios and appointed Chris Villavarayan, Chief Operating Officer. As you saw in the press release announcing Chris's appointment, he has been with Meritor for 20 years in various leadership roles. In each of those positions, he has excelled and has made significant contributions toward achieving the targets we set forth both in M2016 and 2019. Global operating responsibility for both of Meritor's business segments was the next appropriate step for Chris and critical to leadership development for our team as we move forward. Notably, Meritor's electrification business is transitioning to low-volume production more quickly than we anticipated as adoption of battery electric commercial vehicles increases globally. This is demonstrated by the new business award we announced today with Paccar. Meritor is providing customers with a range of electric powertrain technology including fully integrated system solutions. We are confident that our differentiated offerings are establishing Meritor as a leader in the industry. With Chris's transition to Chief Operating Officer, I will be personally dedicating more time to electrification as we expand product development, integrate TransPower and grow our customer base. I look forward to having more direct involvement in refining and executing our strategic plan as we go to market with our blue horizon portfolio that serves global customers in many different applications. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a capital allocation update. On our last earnings call mid-November, we noted that we have repurchased $60 million of shares as part of our planned $300 million share repurchase program for fiscal year 2020. Since that time, we have repurchased an additional $140 million of shares for a total of 8.8 million shares purchased effectively completing two thirds of the 2020 program. Late last fiscal year, we exercised our option to terminate the aftermarket distribution arrangement with Fabco. We now expect to complete that transaction in this quarter with proceeds anticipated to be at the high-end of the $225 million to $265 million range we previously disclosed. As a result, we accelerated $200 million of repurchases in the first four months of this fiscal year. As we have said, we believe that committing capital towards significant share repurchases is one of the primary ways we intend to achieve our shareholder return objectives under M2022. On Slide 5 we highlighted variety of products introduced in the quarter. These new offerings further demonstrate that we continue to expand our portfolio maintaining the aggressive new product launch cadence initiated under our M plans. As part of M2022, we have a clear view toward maintaining our leading market share positions with best in class products and services. We are introducing new products including our single piston air disc break in our range of high-efficiency axles. This includes a new vocational axle that is the first of its type in decades. We are also bringing to market the lightest weight trailer suspension in the industry providing 23,000 pound capacity for tankers, flatbeds and other demanding vocational applications. Let's take a look at Slide 6, first I am pleased to announce today that we were selected as Paccar supplier of electric powertrain for and Peter [ph] and heavy duty battery electric vehicles. Production is targeted to begin in 2021. We are very excited about this opportunity with such an important customer. As you know, we have had a long-standing relationship with Paccar and look forward to expanding the scope of that collaboration. Additionally, Meritor has also delivered six blue horizon electric powertrains to Daimler Trucks North America for it's EM2 innovation fleet. These are being manufactured in one of our facilities in North Carolina. We continue to be a leader in electrification for the commercial vehicle industry and are positioning the company for long-term success by expanding our product portfolio and technology capabilities. Last year we announced in addition to the 14XE, we will begin development of the medium duty 12XE and the 17XE for heavy duty application primarily in Europe. And as you heard last week, we've acquired the remaining voting equity interest in TransPower for $16 million, expanding our offering to include full EV integration capability that enables us to continue delivering complete battery electric systems to our OEM customers. As I've said, the pace of investment and opportunities in this space is accelerating more quickly than we originally foresaw and we believe this will result in additional production awards for us over the next 12 months. Today our book of expected business is greater than $200 million and growing. We also have line of sight to other potential production awards that could drive our revenue pipeline north of $500 million, which we expect to be profitable as production ramps up in fiscal 2021. As we are successful in finalizing these opportunities, we will be sure to update you. Overall, I believe we have tremendous opportunities in front of us and I'm very pleased with how we are positioned in electrification. On Slide 7, I wanted to highlight our investment to build a manufacturing facility in Brazil. As we see the region continue to recover and grow, this is the right time for us to optimize our footprint. This project is one of the largest manufacturing cost reduction programs in M2022 and will help us achieve our margin objective. As we mentioned last quarter we are happy to be part of the e-Consortium with Volkswagen in Brazil, which provides us with the opportunity to supply axles for E delivery vehicles. As we look at the quarter, I'm pleased with our performance as we navigate end market volumes that are significantly lower on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us with significant financial flexibility. Our increased free cash flow generation provides us with the opportunities to continue returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan while we also invest in our core product portfolio and electrification business. The company is well positioned to deliver strong growth, margin improvement and robust free cash flow generation under M2022. With that I'll turn the call over to Carl for more detail on the financials. Carl Anderson : Thanks Jay and good morning. On today's call I'll review our first quarter financial results and updated full-year guidance. Overall, as you heard from Jay, we delivered a solid start to 2020. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64, reflecting our ability to manage the business effectively across current end market conditions. Additionally, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and in the first four months of the fiscal year, we have repurchased over 10% of outstanding shares. This reflects our continued confidence in achieving and delivering on our M2022 targets. Let's walk through the details by turning to Slide 8 where you'll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $901 million in the quarter down $137 million from a year ago driven primarily by lower global truck production and lower volumes across your other businesses. This was partially offset by revenue from AxleTech, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019. As anticipated we saw a significant decrease in North America Class 8 production in the first quarter. Compared to the same period last year, production was down almost 17,000 units or about 20%. Additionally in Europe, production was down approximately 18,000 units or 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and in India, production volumes which were down almost 40% continued to be impacted by the emission standard changeover that will occur on April 1, which requires all vehicles sold after this date to comply with the new standards. This is resulting in an industry-wide focus of reducing inventory levels prior to the changeover. Additionally, we are seeing tighter credit conditions which is also contributing to the market challenges and finally revenue from AxleTech helped to offset slowing market conditions in our North America aftermarket specialty and trailer businesses. Looking at the right side of the page, we did a good job of managing cost to limit total downside earning conversion to 15% on the lower revenue. Lower volume decreased sales by $127 million or 12% from last year. On this revenue decline, adjusted EBITDA decreased $17 million or 14%. Our ability to manage cost on lower revenue was highlighted this quarter as we were able to drive lower material, labor and operating [ph] expense which resulted in very solid downside conversion performance. In addition foreign exchange was a slight headwind on sales as the US dollar had strengthen year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by $4 million compared to the prior year. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $98 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9%. Looking at the left-hand side of the chart, gross margin came in at 14.1% this quarter an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. This improvement was mainly driven by lower overall material costs including reduced layered capacity cost. You also recall, we announced a restructuring plan at the end of fiscal year last September. The plan was implemented in anticipation of the slowing market conditions we are now experiencing. As a result we did recognize $5 million related to the restructuring in the first quarter. As we move down the table on the left, you'll see that we're reporting $39 million of GAAP net income from continuing operations. In addition to lower sales compared to last year in fiscal 2019 we recognized a $31 million gain from the remeasurement of the Maremont asbestos liability, which did not repeat. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $52 million resulting in $0.64 per adjusted diluted share. And finally free cash was negative $35 million this quarter compared to negative $12 million in the same period last year. As you may recall, we typically use cash in the first quarter due to fewer selling days as a result of the holiday season which generally drives lower revenues and incentive compensation payments for achieve performance in 2019. Let's move to Slide 9, which details our first quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck segment, sales decreased by 20% to $622 million. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower truck production across most regions in the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $56 million, down $21 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9% down from 9.9% in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower freight and material cost, including reduced net steel and layer capacity cost. Lower labor and burden cost also contributed to managing to 13% downside conversion on the lower revenue in the segment. In our aftermarket industrial and trailer segment, sales were $370 million up $14 million or 5% from last year. The increase in sales was primarily driven by revenue from AxleTech, partially offset by decreased volumes across the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $40 million which was flat compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points to 12.6%. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact from AxleTech as the expected benefit from synergies continues to ramp up to full run rate. Next I'll review our updated fiscal year 2020 global market outlook on Slide 10. We are revising production levels for India to between 265,000 to 285,000 units down over 15% from our prior outlook. Based on the market uncertainty we're seeing in this region, it is likely that the production levels after April 1 may not fully compensate for the lower production levels we are seeing now. In Europe, we're lowering our production outlook by 5,000 reflecting slightly lower truck demand and finally we are revising our outlook for the US trailer market to approximately 230,000 units to 240,000 units as we are now forecasting the trailer market to decrease more in line with Class 8 truck production. On the next slide, we provide a summary of our 2020 guidance based on these updated market assumptions. We now expect revenue to be approximately $3.7 million which is at the lower end of our previously provided guidance. We're also revising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin to 11%. We expect to manage our downside revenue conversion at the low-end of our expected range through our laser focus on managing cost. As a result of the slightly lower expectations, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be approximately $2.75 which is consistent with the low-end of our previous guidance. And finally, we now expect to generate free cash flow of $165 million this year. While we cannot control the global markets, we are pleased with our team's ability to quickly adjust to market changes and delivered solid financial results as we begin our M2022 plan. Now we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Faheem Sabeiha : Hi. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions and Chris, congrats on the promotion. Jay you mentioned the $500 million revenue opportunity for the EV portfolio, but I was wondering what's baked into your guide this year and I guess what does the ramp look like over the next few years. Jay Craig : As I mentioned in my comments, the production of the Paccar work begins next year. So we're wrapping up our capabilities on the manufacturing side particularly at TransPower to deliver those vehicles beginning in 2021 and then we see them reach what we would call full production rate during 2022. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And can you talk about the revenue content of these EV systems on the Paccar trucks plus the other platforms you expect to go live on versus your contents on a diesel engine. I just want to understanding what the profitability looks like on these projects. Jay Craig : We're not disclosing specifics on that right now but the way you could think about it is this is somewhere between prototype and low-volume production. So the prices are quite a bit higher than we would expect when it reaches full production. So even though the range we gave at our last Analyst Day of 5 to 10 times the content when we got to full production mode these particular content levels are quite a bit higher than that because we're still somewhat at the prototype stage of these volumes. Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And is there any white space left in the portfolio and EV portfolio or are there other services or offerings that Meritor is maybe eyeing that would increase the EV value proposition of the customer at this point? Jay Craig : Absolutely. As I mentioned in the comments, really twofold, we're thrilled with our purchase of the remaining equity at TransPower. We think that integration capabilities have significant growth opportunities for us in all different types of applications, be them medium duty refuse, school buses, heavy-duty, so a lot of white space growth. But just as importantly, I discussed our intent to launch our 17Xe and 17Xe electric exile. Right now we're running with just the 14Xe and those other two actual offerings will bring us into different market segments. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. James Picariello : So just at a high level regarding the guidance, is the generalization here that we're seeing some additional weakening across US trailers, Europe, India and you're still delivering a mid-teens on just that modest weakening in the markets that you're seeing? Carl Anderson : James, it's Carl. I think that's right. I think if you look at the guidance, the markets we did take down are what your referenced. We're still seeing North America come in relatively consistent with what we thought previously and it's really just the capabilities and ability for us to manage the cost structure to be at that lower end of our downside conversion levels of that -- around that 15% and that's what we're really managing the company to. James Picariello : Got it. And then can you just talk about what the status of your internal actions are with respect to, is the restructuring plan completely finalized now and then maybe just some other cost-our initiatives that help support the margin resilience for the year and also how are commodities trending? Jay Craig : You would expect James company operating in deeply cyclical environments that we do. We're constantly looking at our cost structure really with the target to try and convert if we can at the lower end of that conversion guidance that we provide of 15% to 20%. Obviously we're successful in doing that this first quarter in spite of this being a quarter of our resolve rapid ramp downs in production. While we're continuously looking at actions that we could potentially take to manage that very volatile volume environment. James Picariello : Okay. And is the status of the restructuring plan is that completely finalized or do you still have some more work to do? Jay Craig : Again we are still -- there are of the previous restructuring plan we announced that is virtually complete, but again we continue to monitor our cost structure and if we see further declines in our market expectations, we will have to take additional cost actions but I believe we've established a track record over the last half dozen years of being very good at reacting to that very, very quickly. James Picariello : Got it. Appreciate it. And then just on AxleTech and maybe I missed this, so my apologies, but what was the contribution in the quarter for AxleTech and how are you thinking about the full-year in terms of the revenue and the synergies that should be realized for AxleTech this year? Carl Anderson : Yes, James, it\u2019s Carl. If you look at the AxleTech revenue, we had about $43 million of revenue from AxleTech. I think what we're seeing, as it relates to the synergies expectations we\u2019re actually kind of above our internal planning from an expectation what we -- that we're delivering on. I think the business itself, we're seeing some general softness just like you're seeing whether it's in the Highway, defense and aftermarket kind of areas of the business which is similar to what we're seeing with the rest of Meritor\u2019s business. But I would say overall, we continue to be very pleased with the strategy and with the acquisition of the company. I think revenue is a little bit softer than what we\u2019re originally planning, if we had the discussion six months ago, but overall, what we're very pleased with is really just the team's ability to execute on the synergy plan and where we stand at this point. James Picariello : Got it, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Alex Potter : Hi, guys. Interested in digging in, I guess maybe a little bit more on this EV opportunity with PACCAR. I guess what I'm trying to understand is once this is in run rate production, are you primarily going to be providing them with eAxles, drivetrain components or is it going to be something that flows through TransPower, these fully electrified chassis type products? Thanks. Carl Anderson : Okay, good question, Alex. The short answer is both. So, that's the beauty of the investment in TransPower is we truly felt that two plus two equals three or four in the Meritor products and the customer relationships we brought could be added with TransPower\u2019s capabilities on in that they're able to provide them the full integration for an electric vehicle. So we will be working now with our wholly owned subsidiary of TransPower on providing fully integrated electric vehicles for PACCAR. And they will be composed also where we can have have Meritor components including eAxles on some of the vehicles. Alex Potter : Okay, thanks, I guess I mean the reason I asked the question is I think you may agree or maybe not, with that. But eventually presumably once electric vehicle penetration reaches a certain threshold, the truck manufacturers themselves are going to have to decide what they view as core and what they're going to rely on the supply chain for. And I got to believe that at some point, they'll take some of that content and do it internally. Maybe that's not the case in the sort of quasi prototype space but I don't know what's your view on when you think the OEMs said on that line differently? Carl Anderson : No, I think as we've spoken before we couldn't agree with you more, that's fine. We've taken what we've labeled an open architecture model towards our work primarily out of TransPower, where we work very closely with our OE\u2019s development teams and work with them on what capabilities they will eventually want to in-source. And as we've mentioned specifically, as an example, we're looking forward to them in sourcing the battery sourcing and battery management systems. We're doing that right now. But we expect that they will integrate that over time because they have actually greater scale for purchasing of those. But offsetting that decline in revenue on that end will be two different items on the other side, coming up which is one are eAxles which were developing and getting to full run rate production will begin to be placed on more vehicles with significantly more content than a traditional axle. And then secondarily, there will be a segment of the market that won't have the scale that will be able to execute all the integration services. So we will be providing those as our technology is proven. Alex Potter : Interesting. Okay, very good. That that makes good sense. I was wondering then outside of electrification, some of the other maybe more slightly more near-term growth initiatives that you've spoken about recently, thinking about things like off-highway precision gearing, maybe medium duty truck share disc brakes, pretty sure I'm omitting a couple more here as well. But if you could maybe just rank order those opportunities based on your recent experience, which ones are doing better than plan in line with plan and maybe some that are performing below expectations? Jay Craig : What I'm going to do is, is like Chris, I wanted him to speak about this breaking opportunities, because we take they are significant, but obviously the biggest opportunity we have during this planning period through 2022 is the successful integration of AxleTech and making sure we garner all of those costs and revenue synergies, particularly as we focus on the off-highway military opportunities there. But I would Chris to also speak about the disc braking side. Chris Villavarayan : Thanks, Jay and good morning, Alex. I think when you think about M22 and our target is $300 million of revenue. And as you look at our presentation, we talked about seven new products, and the one right in the middle is the disc brake, our single piston disc brake that we\u2019re launching. As we announced over a year-ago, we have a standard agreement on air disc brakes with Daimler. And we're looking as one customer and as we're growing here in the future, we plan to take this globally and grow the disc brakes. So the disc brake business is a considerable part of our growth strategy going forward. Alex Potter : Great, very good, thanks a lot guys. Chris Villavarayan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brian Johnson : Great, I both have kind of outlook kind of housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. In terms of just and I know you have hit in this before, but the commercial truck downside conversion was very strong at 15%. I was particularly struck by the how gross margins held in which would seem to imply that perhaps you're managing detrimentals on the SG&A OpEx side. Could you maybe talk about that or in particular with the gross margin get better, was there a commodity tailwind there? Carl Anderson : Yes, Brian it\u2019s Carl, I think you're right on the gross margin, what we did see is we did see some benefit from steel in the quarter, kind of similar in line what we talked about back in November as far as outlook for the full-year. So I would say steel was probably a mid single digit million tailwind for us in the quarter. We also had a pretty significant improvement in cost as it relates to labor and burden in the quarter as well as really managing kind of our freight expenses well. So it's really, it was a combination of all of those items which were all around kind of the same type of magnitude for the quarter in which we saw which helped really drive the improvement in gross margin for us. Brian Johnson : Okay, second question around what are you seeing in kind of the mid truck market in North America that gives you some greater confidence in both how it\u2019s held up and then how it's going to look over the coming year? Carl Anderson : Well, right now in terms of the market, I think we're in line with where we see, let's call it the external rating agencies coming in ACT and FTR between 240 to 250. And then on top of that, as I look at the line rates that we're seeing from our customers, I believe all those three are actually boxing in very closely. So we're quite comfortable with what we see going forward. Maybe your question on with respect to new trucks and where we see that going in the future, I think trucks are becoming far more efficient as we see. And obviously, we've seen over the last two years and with the path of electrification diesels got to get even more efficient. So I think that's one place where we've really play strongly. And so I think it's equally important because if you think about our high efficiency axles that we've launched recently as well as you know, the axles that we have coming, Jay talked about the new vocational axle, we really believe that the efficiency gain will drive it and I just want to clarify one point also on the forecast, it's 245,000 to 255,000. Brian Johnson : Okay, and then finally the PACCAR obviously prototype to look in its early days but then you talked about some things like battery management, how are you thinking about the software that would span across managing the flow from the battery, the flow through the power electronics, and then the actual control, the motors itself, is that something where you're whether it's some of the acquisitions you made, you're writing the software, or are you basically providing the hardware and the OEM partners doing the software? Carl Anderson : Very good question, Brian. I mean, that's why the TransPower investment and now the acquisition of the remaining equity was so critical, TransPower provides supervisory controls to the software in that area, that makes the whole system run including instrumentation on the vehicle, breaking all the other supervisory controls. They also provide the battery management controls that determine the energy rate of energy flow and the utilization of energy. So we do have software and software engineers at TransPower. In addition, we've ramped up within Meritor, our software engineering capability just to manage the features in the eAxle because that eAxle obviously containing motor components, cooling components requires a lot of software system intellectual properties. So we have an entire software team here in our Troy research center that's focused on the software on the eAxle as well. Brian Johnson : And as part of that, are you getting close loop data out of vehicles on the road that would allow you to refine the algorithms and control algorithms? Carl Anderson : Yes, we welcome any of our investors or analysts to come visit TransPower in San Diego and you can ride on the test vehicles with me and see how they operate. We have thousands and thousands of test miles on these vehicles right now. Brian Johnson : And any plan once those get on the road to continue to harvest the data, I\u2019m thinking here of last night and? Carl Anderson : Yes, continuously. Sorry for misunderstanding your question. But yes, it\u2019s true. Brian Johnson : Yes, I know, I'm thinking of the advantage the Tesla has in terms of getting for its BMS and control systems? Carl Anderson : Correct, although I think as we heard in a previous question, it is our expectation with the large OEs that they will start to take control of management of some of that data as well. And we're very open and working with them to enable them to do that. Brian Johnson : Okay, thank you. Carl Anderson : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Clearly you have accelerated the share repurchases here, which as you've mentioned before, provides flexibility toward meeting those longer-term targets in a wider variety of macro scenarios. I'm curious though, just given that only $100 million remains whether you intend to pursue another authorization or what your plans might be after the current authorization is completed? Carl Anderson : Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl, I think you're absolutely right, we have $100 million left to go which the board has authorized us. And we've been in the first four months pretty aggressive in the share repurchases. We did signal last quarter that we have an opportunity in front of us over the next couple of years is related to what we're generating in free cash flow to repurchase up to potentially another 400 million of shares. And so I think our approach will be we'd like to fully execute and complete the existing program. But I would believe that once we do that, we'll be in a position to seek further authorization, especially where the stock is currently trading. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on Slide 8 regarding that catch all volume mix performance, other category driver of EBITDA, I know you'd call it out your decremental track for the lower end of your targeted range, which indicates solid performance within that category. But are you just able to maybe disaggregate that bucket a little bit, what is electrification investment running within this category? And how are you thinking about the impact of performance or electrification investment for the full fiscal year? Carl Anderson : Yes, I think Ryan as we look at the quarter specifically, electrification really was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis at least in the first quarter, we do expect that to continue to ramp-up for the rest of this fiscal year. And I think what we were talking about, probably up about $10 million or so from a year-ago. So overall as it relates about that line item itself, when you kind of do the math is about 13% downside conversion with all the components but as we go forward, we do see this pickup and ramp up in electrification spend especially with the success we've had with the new PACCAR win as well as with the TransPower acquisition. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Just lastly from me regarding that new facility in Brazil, there's been some reticence to invest more capital in light vehicle capacity in that region on the part of suppliers. Can you just maybe talk a little bit? Why you're excited about this? Is it a case of increased localization, which helps to offset currency risk? Or also, I heard you say that it was a significant cost savings move. So maybe it's replacing some older, more expensive capacity anymore how to think about that would be helpful, thanks. Chris Villavarayan : Yes, excellent, Ryan. This is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that one. So I think you hit on two points that we've been in Brazil for several years, actually over 50 years. And our current location is landlocked, and we're unable to grow from that site. And the Brazilian market, as you could imagine, and you have seen through many of our quarters is a very important market for Meritor. And so we made the decision many years ago to make a long-term commitment here and we've been working on deciding a new facility here for over 10 years. And so with the market continuing to strengthen and we've seen it strengthened over the last four to five years are our thoughts are we need a new facility, we\u2019ll add more capacity and drive local content to your point also bring us closer to our customers and also drive the best-in-class cost. It provides us yet another opportunity, have to build a new facility that's more modernized and then continues to drive our cost position. So it is one of the largest as Jay pointed out, cost reduction opportunities in our M22 plan. Ryan Brinkman : Great, it\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot. Chris Villavarayan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joseph Spak : Thanks, everyone. I guess first just on the aftermarket industrial trailer segment, so margins are down. You called out in some of the integration. You lowered your trailer outlook but then the synergies ran through the year. Like what do we expect margins for the year, for the whole year in that segment to be now like, can they be fired? Or should we sort of start modeling them down now given some of the incremental headwinds? Carl Anderson : Yes, I think, Joe what we are seeing, we definitely see a margin increase in kind of from the current run rate that we finished the first quarter in. The one thing to take into account is just the overall just general softness we're seeing across the segment, obviously, we talked trailers, but also with the industrial and off-highway parts of the business and aftermarket itself that we're seeing here in North America. We're just seeing some general softness, but our expectations, as you know, we don't give a number specifically for the year by this segment, but we definitely see that margin increasing progressing throughout the year. Joseph Spak : Driven by the synergies ramping on? Carl Anderson : Yes. Joseph Spak : Okay, Jay the TransPower full acquisition, not a surprise, I think you've sort of hinted or indicated this could be possible. But you've also been working very closely with them to-date. So like, just what specifically does sort of the full ownership allow you to do now that you weren't able to do before? Jay Craig : Well, I think it's just overall the statement to the employee base there of how importantly are to Meritor. I think we're the perfect home for them. And what we've found in the period that we've had an investment in TransPower is those benefits are even greater than we originally estimated. And we each bring different skill sets. Obviously Meritor has over 100 year history of production for the commercial vehicle industry. And we can assist TransPower as they're moving from this low volume prototype stage to production stage. And we actually have a Head of Production that resides in San Diego and has for many months now. That's an executive of Meritor that is running the production floor. And TransPower brings to us the development expertise in this particular area and jump starts us as a full vehicle integrator. So I think overall, it's been a perfect marriage, the employees at TransPower that I meet are just thrilled to be part of Meritor. So I think it's just a natural progression. Joseph Spak : Okay, and then lastly from me, with the appointment of Chris to COO, very exciting and I appreciate Chris, all Chris's sort of comments and look forward to talking more with him. But you've also like been an operating story and operating at a very high level for some time. So what specifically did you see that led you to believe that now is the right time to have that role? And I guess I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but is there any element of succession planning in this decision as well? Jay Craig : Well, to be honest, there's always elements of succession planning whenever anybody gets promoted. But I'm not saying that in any time in the foreseeable future, I see stepping away from the company. It's really twofold. Chris has really been my partner in time on the operating side. I was reading through my prepared remarks, almost everything related to the operating side of the product side. I would say Chris has either led or we've jointly led. So I think a lot of it is recognition of Chris\u2019s importance to the business. But secondarily also, as I've mentioned, the rate of the ramp-up of the electrification business has been much happened much more quickly than any of us anticipated. And those capital allocation decisions and other critical decisions around that business have really ended up flowing to my desk as you would expect, and I think it's the right time just for me to get more directly involved with that and make sure we're all aligned on those different decision points we have we encountered. Joseph Spak : Great, I really appreciate that color. Thank you. Jay Craig : Okay, thank you. Carl Anderson : Thanks Joe. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Todd Chirillo for any closing remarks. Todd Chirillo : Thank you for joining our call today. Please reach out to me directly, if you have any questions. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay. Jay Craig : Thanks Todd and good morning. I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks to all our Meritor employees for their dedication and hard work as we take on the challenges we faced today. As part of an essential business, Meritor employees remain committed to supporting the delivery of medical, food and other critical products for our communities around the world. I also want to express my thanks to the frontline workers that Meritor had the privilege to support in the fight against Covid-19. I'll now spend just a couple minutes talking about the second quarter before providing an update on the status of the business today in light of Covid-19. Let's turn to Slide 3. The company was performing extremely well before the pandemic began to impact production first in China beginning in mid-January then throughout the rest of the world beginning late in the second quarter and continuing into the third. Carl will share more detail, but here you can see the highlights from the quarter. Sales were down $285 million from last year due to lower volumes. We finished the quarter however with a 12.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 12% in the same quarter of last year. That income was $240 million, up $167 million from the same period last year. This was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO. Our liquidity position at the end of the second quarter was $829 million. This represents approximately 20% of our trailing 12-month sales. Cash on the balance sheet was $508 million. We have access to the remaining $321 million of availability under our revolving credit facility and expect to be in compliance with our covenants under this facility for the remainder of the year. Although, it is still early to accurately forecast the extent of the pandemic's impact on the industry, the strong foundation we built over the past several years will provide advantages as we work through this crisis. Let's go to Slide 4. As we bring operations up around the world, the safety of our employees is our highest priority. Over time, we have improved our safety record to be comparable with the best companies in the world and it is my intent to maintain that level of excellence as we face the challenge of protecting our employees during this global health crisis. We have developed a comprehensive set of procedures that make up safe start. This plan outlines protocols for operating in this new reality. It includes procedures and policies that will be audited at each of our global locations whether it's a manufacturing plant, office, distribution center or a test environment. These practices include preventative measures in entryways and common locations, heat mapping to identify areas that require special attention, personal protective equipment, wellness checks, more frequent and in-depth cleanings, visual indicators and the attrition [Indiscernible] 0:05:52.5of social distance coaches, to ensure that we are following and sharing best practices across the company. I have asked Meritor's General Auditor to assume the additional role of Chief Safety Compliance Officer. He will consult with outside experts as needed to ensure that best practices are being implemented and followed. On Slide 5, we provide a current update on our global operations. Meritor's aftermarket distribution business ran without interruption over the past two months to maintain the supply of critical replacement parts for trucks and trailers. Our industrial business operated at lower volumes to support the production of vehicles considered critical for defense, bus and coach, terminal tractor, fire and rescue and other off highway applications. We also maintained delivery of battery electric kits from our TransPower facility in California primarily for Kalmar terminal tractors for delivery to companies like Amazon and Walmart. And we continue to work on critical electric vehicle integration projects for our customers. Currently, the majority of our operations in North America and Europe have resumed limited production. Over the coming weeks, we also expect to restart operations in South America and India. China resumed full operations last month. We acted swiftly to implement a series of actions that took effect in early April. This allowed us time to look at the business longer term and evaluate next steps. These actions included a reduction in pay for salaried employees in addition to reduce discretionary spending and capital expenditures. Since that time, we have lessened the salary reduction for most employees beginning May 1 the current reduction in payer 40% to 50% of base salaries will be reduced to 20% to 25%. Salary reductions for the executive committee including me will remain up to previously set levels of 50% to 60%. Other actions announced in March are in fact indefinitely. Now, I'll turn the call over to Carl. Carl Anderson : Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call I'll review our second quarter financial results, liquidity position, debt maturity profile and retirement related liabilities. Before I begin, I wanted to take an opportunity to express how proud I'm of our team's ability to quickly mobilize and rise to the challenges, which have been placed before us. Now, let's walk through our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Overall, sales were $871 million, down 25% from the same period last year. Sales in our commercial truck segment decreased by 33% year-over-year to $588 million. The decrease in revenue was in line with global truck market conditions as all regions saw lower production levels. The suspension of production due to COVID-19 first in China in mid-January and then late March in Europe also contributed to lower sales. In our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment sales was $319 million, down $10 million or 3% from last year. Lower sales were primarily driven by decreased volumes across the segment including the beginning impacts of COVID-19 and overall market demand, partially offset by $43 million in revenue generated from our AxleTech business. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $240 million compared to $73 million in the same period last year. As Jay mentioned higher net income year-over-year was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the aftermarket distribution arrangement with WABCO. Adjusted EBITDA was $107 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $139 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3% compared to 12% a year ago. The improvement in margin was largely driven by a $10 million adjustment of lower incentive compensation expense to align with the revised performance expectations due to COVID-19. We also recognized the $4 million benefit resulting from a tax law change in India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $55 million, down $33 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9.4%, down from 10% in the prior year. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs, lower net steel cost, and other material costs. Segment adjusted EBITDA in our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment was $49 million, a decrease of $3 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 40 basis points to 15.4%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $292 million compared to $19 million in the same period last year. The increase in free cash flow was driven primarily by the $265 million of cash received from WABCO. Next, I'll review the debt governs of revolving credit facility on Slide 7. The credit facility as the sole financial covenant based on priority debt which is a subset of our total outstanding debt. The calculation states priority debt cannot exceed trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA by more than 2.25x. It is important to note, the $265 million pretax income we recorded associated with the WABCO termination is included in trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA. Now let me walk you through the calculation in detail. First, priority debt is comprised of any outstanding borrowings under the revolver inclusive of any term loan funding, any outstanding US factoring and US securitization balances plus any secured lien for us consists of our capital leases. In total, priority debt as of the second quarter was $633 million. Secondly, priority debt as compared to trailing 12 months compliance EBITDA which starts with consolidated net income and then added back our depreciation, amortization, interest in taxes. Including other minor adjustments, the total 12 months trailing compliance EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was $701 million. The results in ratio are 0.9x priority debt compared to compliance EBITDA significantly under the limit of 2.25x. Furthermore, the covenant is only measured on the last day of each quarter. If compliance is achieved, the covenant is being met for the entire following quarter. As the income from the WABCO termination will be included in our priority debt calculation for four fiscal quarter is going forward, at this time, we expect to be in compliance with our covenant throughout the year and maintain access to the full credit facility. Let's move to Slide 8, which details our extended debt maturity profile and retirement liabilities. As you can see on the chart on the left, we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. In fact, we only have $4 million of debt coming due for the remainder of this year and $32 million in total debt maturities in fiscal year 2021. You will note in fiscal year 2023, we saw the maturity for our US securitization facility. We typically extend this facility annually for an additional year, which we would expect to do again later this year. The bottom line is that we have a clear runway with our debt maturities with no significant cause on cash through 2024. At the end of 2019, our net pension liability was a $122 million, which translated to a 93% overall funded status. Based on this, we expect very manageable required contributions over the next couple of years. And while we have obviously seen challenging financial markets as we ended the second quarter, our estimated funding status has actually improved from the end of 2019. This has been driven by a combination of strong US asset returns in the plan, which are up over 10% through March and higher discount rates as corporate spreads have widened. While our plans will continue to be susceptible to changes in asset returns and discount rates as we move through the remainder of the year. Our asset allocation is skewed more towards fixed income given our liability hedging strategy. Overall, we are pleased with the performance to date. Turning to our OPEB liability, as we have previously discussed we have taken steps in recent years to significantly reduce this obligation. At the end of 2019, this liability was only $67 million. Overall with an extended debt maturity profile and well-funded pension plan, we don't have any significant cost and cash from these liabilities in the near-term. In summary, the balance sheet actions we have executed over the last several years along with our current liquidity position makes us well-positioned to navigate the current environment. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay. Jay Craig : Thanks, Carl. Please turn to Slide 9 for our third quarter outlook. Let me highlight our assumptions, as I said it earlier segments of our operations have continued to run. We expect these businesses to contribute between 50% to 60% of our revenue during the third quarter. To restart and ramp up of our commercial truck business is not as clear, while we expect most of our plants around the world will be running in early May, there is uncertainty on timing and volume, which is driving a large range of our revenue outlook of $400 million to $500 million. Negative cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $225 million. This includes the one-time impact of the unwind of our factoring programs. These programs allow us to monetize our receivables quickly after they are generated. Removing the impact of factoring, we expect negative cash flow from operations of $25 million to $50 million during the third quarter. Turning to margins, we expect to hold sequential detrimentals in the third quarter in the range of 20% to 30%. This includes additional investment required to implement new safety protocols. We were able to achieve this due to the quick and aggressive cost containment measures we have already taken. I want to emphasize that we are running the business to focus on operational cash flow in the near term. Let's move to Slide 10. As we enter the second-half of the fiscal year and restart production, we are making sure that every safety protocol is in place, including providing the necessary PPE. With the existing challenges, it obtaining large quantities of masks, gloves, cleaning supplies and disinfectants. We will first make sure that each of our plants, distribution centers and testing labs has the necessary quantities on hand before we start allocating these supplies to global administrative offices. I have been pleased with the adjustments that our salaried employees have made to working remotely. With that in mind, our salaried employees will work from home until further notice. We have begun to see the favorable impact of our aggressive cost reduction initiatives. As I mentioned, we believe these initiatives will provide the stability necessary to minimize negative operating cash outflow in the near term. We are working closely with our customers to run production as needed to meet their schedules. Our assumptions include a significant decrease level of production for the remainder of 2020 and we will evaluate and implement additional cost actions with a focus on minimizing operating cash flow in the near term. As we now turn our attention to the longer term outlook for the company, we are evaluating the appropriate strategies for a global environment where demand for our products may be weak for many quarters. We plan to provide you with a longer term outlook for fiscal 2021 and our M2022 planned performance on our third quarter earnings call if there is a set of market forecasts that we are comfortable with for modeling purposes. This outlook will include a summation of the benefits we expect to see from the longer term actions we're in the planning phase of executing. While the pandemic created a situation unlike any we have faced in the past with the full repercussions as yet unknown, we are taking the actions we believe will put the company in the best position for the long term. I want to thank Meritor employees for their focus during this unprecedented crisis. Our employees' dedication and responsiveness to customers and to each other has been overwhelming. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. JosephSpak: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and good to hear all your voices. I hope everyone is okay. I guess first question is even if we sort of look at the decrementals in this quarter ex some of the incentive benefit, it still seems like there's a step down on the decrementals into the next quarter. Is that just all sort of you know volume driven as you know sort of feeling the bigger the clients or is there anything else that could sort of help bridge that gap between the performance? CarlAnderson: Yes. Good morning, Joe. Good to talk to you as well. Yes, as I think we look at the next quarter. One this, what we provided was a sequential look relative to the second quarter. I think when you cut through the math on a year-over-year basis it gets - it's kind of running a little bit in the low 20% range. And as far as we look specifically for the second quarter, as you pointed out we did benefit from lower incentive comps in our actuals, as well as the - in the one-time kind of tax impact that ran through EBITDA. JosephSpak: Okay and yes just, while I guess actually somewhat related. Obviously, sort of taking out a bunch of cost in the short-term and I guess some of that can be viewed as temporary. But as you mentioned sort of maybe new world, new era. Is there an opportunity to sort of maybe as you reevaluate make some of those temporary savings more permanent in the mid to long term as you reevaluate the cost structure? JayCraig: Joe, this is Jay. Thanks, very good question. Obviously, that was what I was referring to in my comments. We think the aggressive actions we took including 40% to 50% to 60% salary reductions in a very short order allowed us the time to sit back and say what is the longer term impact of this crisis look like to Meritor. And what additional actions should we take that can allow us to be successful throughout what potentially could be a longer term downturn. So we are looking at strategies as I mentioned in my comments and beginning to execute them that. We think we'll set our cost structure on the right basis for what we would expect to see for fiscal year 2021 and beyond. JosephSpak: Yes. Jay, the tough one, you know sort of, I guess, plan for otherwise hope, hope over the best mentality, but as a veterinary industry, I wanted to I guess pick your brand and what you thought could it be the potential snapback ability of the market and maybe what you're sort of hearing maybe from some of the, even your customers because even - if you look at sort of typical peak to trough timing probably would have normally come to the end of sort of cycle sometime around the end of the calendar year maybe a little later. And COVID obviously made it much steeper, but even if you sort of don't return to the replacement levels next year, it seems like there could be some pretty healthy growth versus obviously a very depressed 2020. So what are \u2013 do you have any high level thoughts on that? JayCraig: Well, I think it \u2013 it's, it's difficult for us to say in the near-term. And you heard the comments from our customers who have their calls, so far, they \u2013 they've been very reticent to project what the outlook looks like in future. And I think that goes for us as well. What I believe and what our team is working on is, is as you mentioned is setting up to plan for the worst and hope for the best and make sure we retain the capabilities in the company to respond to the aggressive snapback that ultimately will occur most likely in long quarters time as it always does and we're going to make certain we retain that expertise to be as successful as we have been and capturing the value on that snapback and those volumes. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question. AlexPotter: Yes. Thanks very much. Hope everybody is doing well. You mentioned that cutting back on CapEx on discretionary spending, can you just give maybe a few examples of things that you are and are not reducing spending on just trying to get a better idea of the sort of initiative that you think are sufficiently important to continue investing in even in this macro? ChrisVillavarayan: Sure. Good morning, Alex. I think you know me, this is Chris Villavarayan. If you look at it, for example last quarter we talked about launching our or building a new facility in Brazil where we were looking at making a significant investment. As we see the current market, we might look at for example slowing down on that investment and just really modeling out where we see the market snapback and then making decisions like that. We are very definitely proceeding with the long-term prospects for Brazil, but in the short term, we might look at slowing down our investment. Also when you think about sustaining investments through our facility imagine for markets that we're running almost 60% to 70% from where we forecast, you could look and make decisions in the short-term on what we do. However, I think one thing that, Jay, is driving that as we think of the long term strategy in terms of investment in electrification, we are not slowing down on that process and as he also mentioned in how we are running the facilities and delivering the proportion or the systems we are continuing our investments into TransPower as well as electrification for the next quarter. AlexPotter: Okay. Very good. That's helpful. I was wondering if you could comment also on the supply chain risk, you know not all companies end up having this sort of balance sheet that you guys have. I'm thinking particularly of risks that you see upstream potentially for smaller suppliers. You know is this going to be an issue, you have solvency risk concerns for any of the suppliers that you rely on. JayCraig: Good question, Alex. And we're using the same playbook that we put in place during the 2008-2009 recession where we immediately put up a multi-discipline team together including finance, purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing expertise to do much more active monitoring of suppliers, particularly those who we think do not have the balance sheets that may provide them enough liquidity through this time period. So far, we have not seen any disruptions, but we're monitoring it extremely closely and that playbook that we did execute in 2008-2009 was very successful for us. Included in that is engagement of outside experts that we can send in to the suppliers to assist them with operational and financial challenges that we've already locked those same experts into agreements if they are necessary. AlexPotter: Interesting. Okay. That's good to hear. I \u2013 one thing, obviously this, this WABCO infusion was, was well timed. Can you update me us on the ongoing relationship with WABCO, if there is any I think \u2013 what is the relationship between the two companies going forward? Have you essentially severed all historical relationships now going forward or not? JayCraig: Yes. We have a much smaller relationship here through our aftermarket business as a distributor for certain products. But it, it, I, I don't want to misrepresent it, it's a fraction of what the business was previously. And those expected revenues are embedded in our outlook for the third quarter. AlexPotter: Okay. Very good. Last question. I know that you had historically looked at some of these smaller sorts of mom and pop machine, machine shop type operation to support aftermarket gearing and off highway. That always struck me as sort of an interesting business. I don't know I guess maybe two questions. First, do you want to continue building that part of the business through acquisition of these little companies? And question number two is, do you think COVID-19 will potentially present you with the opportunities to do that? JayCraig: That's a very good question, Alex. I think it gets around the broader question as obviously there will be M&A opportunities that present themselves through this crisis for people who maybe don't operate as well or have the financial wherewithal to withstand the downturn. At this point in time, we are focused to make certain that our company operates successfully as it's currently configured. And we like the growth prospects of the company in areas like electrification, like our recent off highway acquisition of AxleTech, so we didn't see a burning need to add bolt-on acquisitions at this time. Now as we come out of the crisis, if there is just some incredible opportunity on the landscape and we see our revenues growing during that time period we may revisit at that time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. JasonStuhldreher: Hi, Jay, and good morning. This is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. And just first question on margins maybe first in the Commercial Truck space. In the past we've talked about sort of layered capacity giving you the ability to sort of flex that debt, the footprint the direct labor footprint given with the variations in Commercial Truck. Just curious I mean in the margins that we saw this quarter, which I frankly thought were pretty good. Did any of those benefits from offloading that layer capacity or did that layer capacity pretty much already hit bottom by last quarter. And then similarly on Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer. I was also impressed by the margins this quarter was thinking the AxleTech acquisition would be a little bit dilutive is that not the case sort of now? CarlAnderson: Good questions. This is Carl Anderson. Just on your first question as relates to Commercial Truck, as we look at those layered capacity cost for the most part those have pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that carried a little bit in the first quarter. And as we go forward as we're kind of back in ramp up mode depending on the supply chains, you could see a little bit maybe some incremental cost kind of coming in over the next couple of quarters, but nowhere near where we were running last year with a high truck markets kind of at that point. And then as relates to your aftermarket question. I think the AxleTech business, I think; we're very pleased with the amount of synergies we've been able to achieve as it relates to that. One thing that's running a little bit softer than initial plan is just overall revenue for that business. And so I think the margins aren't exactly where we want them to be currently, but as you know over time as revenue begins hopefully at some point pick up, I think we're going to be in good position with an acquisition in that business. JayCraig: And just adding to Carl's comment, I think one of the benefits we got with also the layered capacity costs coming down is also a benefit from not seeing the premium freight costs associated with all of that. So we have seen some benefit both from the layered capacity as well as the premium freight. And I think in terms of the overall cost of purchase components versus our own internal cost there's also the benefit that we're seeing from that as well. JasonStuhldreher: All right. Got it. Okay, very helpful color. And then just I guess more broadly as we think about the electrification opportunity, Jay, I think you've mentioned, the team has mentioned how pivotal of a year 2020 we're shaping out to be in terms of the awards activity pipeline that was going to be coming here in the next few quarters. Just curious if that pipeline is still full or if that is \u2013 if the industry is basically push that out 8 to 12 months as we deal with the current situation? JayCraig: Yes. It's a very good question, Jason. Obviously, I think it's a question on the industry spend where this will be viewed as something that can be deferred to preserve capital. But so far all of the programs we're associated with particularly the largest program, the PACCAR program, it remains on schedule. I've had technical updates with the PACCAR team recently. Our products are performing extremely well and so we see no sign that our customers not too dissimilar from us are not continuing to prioritize that spend. And as Chris mentioned in one of his comments, this is one area with all the cost reductions we've made both on the CapEx and expense side. We are retaining our investments in electrification and we continually continue to respond to active code opportunities and still look at this year to be a very big year for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. RyanBrinkman: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Is there anything that you can relate about customer order books in the back half of the calendar year after lockdowns are presumably lifted? I'm sure their visibility is also low, but when you look across your various customers and your various end markets you know commercial and highway, off-highway, specialty trailer et cetera, are there notable differences and how you expect these end markets to bounce back or hold up. ChrisVillavarayan: And maybe I'll take this one Ryan, just you know as you can see that we're not giving much guidance beyond the next quarter. Again, it's from the perspective that we are seeing from our customers as well. But at a very high level, let's just break it down into maybe the three areas. And if you think about aftermarket and we've looked through last quarter as well as you know what we're seeing at least in the short-term window, aftermarket is obviously holding well you know when you think about 75% of the products that we use to travel by truck. The aftermarket seems to be holding strong. We see a slight weakening but nothing that's dramatic in the near future. Moving to the specialty defense of highway space. As I think Carl pointed out, we have noticed, you know, we did notice at the back end of that order board was getting weaker, we could say maybe about 20%, 30% but nothing of significance obviously consistent demand on that side and we got to see how that plays out. The truck market is obviously the big one as we see the customers coming up in April or late April and early May, that's where we're going to probably see what the real order boards come in. So, we \u2013 all the customers will be up of you know as we see most will be up as up May 4. So that would be probably a good time to see a perspective. But then breaking it up by region maybe I'll just address in that way China, you know as, as you all of you know I think we've seen a quick V and markets are back now whether that will hold up is all based on stimulus. And then India and South America are still under a pretty hard shut down and so time will tell how those two markets will come up. But in those two markets, inventories were low as you know with the FX. And the other two markets have addressed previously, I think we just have to see where our customers come back at. RyanBrinkman: Okay. Thanks. You know those are helpful rundown. Just lastly from me, why are you it looks like unwinding some of your factoring facilities. Can you remind us, was that something that was previously planned you know prior to your mention in that March 25 release? And does it relate to the various Volvo facilities mentioned in the K or the US one with P&C that I think has a covenant attached. I'm just asking because it would seem maintaining the facilities might help bolster liquidity in the current environment or am I missing something? Thanks. CarlAnderson: Yes. Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl. Good question. You know I think that the factoring unwind is really \u2013 it's really that's a function of having a lot lower sales especially - really in Europe where we are utilizers of the supply chain financing program. So it's - if the unwind is just more, it's more natural because we're not able to sell receivables in normal course because the sales are a lot lower. The real impact is just because you have a timing mismatch as far as obviously the payables need to kind of run off in the working capital perspective. And you are unable to sell new receivables. So yes, it is consistent with what we kind of provided back in the March 25, March 25th 8-K that we put out as well. Operator : Our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc. You may proceed with your questions. JamesPicariello: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just regarding your covenant, the total priority debt over, over trailing EBITDA, I mean it seems very encouraging how the EBITDA is calculated; you just to clarify this include the gain on the WABCO aftermarket sale now. Is that right? And then, has there been any change on that point? And then just based on your third quarter outlook that outlook clearly be the most challenged environment, is it safe to assume that the Meritor can now avoid any covenant breach over the next 12-months? Thanks, Jay and Carl. CarlAnderson: Yes. Thanks, James. Yes. I mean I think what you're seeing from the WABCO income, yes, it is included in the trailing 12-month calculation. And so as I was highlighting that we're kind of carry through for the next really four quarters as well as we look to calculate the overall compliance to EBITDA. So as we look at what's in front of us not only third quarter but for the rest of this year, our expectation is we will not have any issues with our debt covenant and we feel that coupled with the overall liquidity of the company. So with the amount of cash on hand I think we're in a pretty good spot to be able to manage the current environment. JamesPicariello: Okay. Yes. That's great to hear. And then just on that factor receivable the previous question, can that reverse partially by as early as the fourth quarter? CarlAnderson: Yes. That's exactly right. And so that's how we're characterizing it. There is, we'll call it a one-time impact at a sales levels dropped significantly based on the lower production volume. But as the fourth quarter, if there is some pick up and production kind of comes back, you will see the cash benefits at that point in time. JamesPicariello: Got it. And then it sounds as though you guys were not stepping off the accelerator in terms of future EV investment for this year. But just in terms of CapEx is a good starting point and assumption of maybe a similar level of your CapEx as a percentage of sales for this year- CarlAnderson: I think that's early - JamesPicariello: Or early to be? CarlAnderson: That's a good way to think about. I think the last quarter that we had a guided about $115 million of CapEx. So it's probably closer in the $80 million, $85 million range at this point as we think for the remainder \u2013 for the full year. So that kind of around 3% is probably the right way to think about it. JamesPicariello: Got it. And then my apologies if I missed this, did you mention the AxleTech contribution in the quarter, so just wondering on that point and then how the synergies are trending, does the current environment accelerate or maybe delay the synergy pull through. CarlAnderson: No. I would say on the synergy side in AxleTech, we're coming in right on plan and actually we're looking and we feel very good with all the actions that we have been able to take since we acquired the company last year. You know there is a reference, obviously, we are seeing some softness in overall just revenue levels, specifically in the off-highway market, as well as in aftermarket. So overall the margin performance is still probably not where we want it to be, but a lot of that now is driven more on the revenue side as opposed to any of the cost actions that we've taken to date. JamesPicariello: And what about the just the revenue contribution in the quarter. CarlAnderson: Yes, it was about $43 million, so very consistent with what we saw in the first quarter as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. You may proceed with your question. FaheemSabeiha: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the guidance you are able to provide for FY 3Q and the additional color regarding the revenue breakdown but can you provide a little more color around Aftermarket, Industrial, and Trailer, I mean, then imply the sizable hit, and I know first talk about aftermarket coming down a little, just wondering if most of that's in Trailer or equally across all three parts of that business. CarlAnderson: Good morning, Faheem. You know I think one of the things that's in there is the impact from the WABCO, agreement being, our distribution agreement being terminated and so prior to the crisis that was a probably a book of business about a $115 million. So you are seeing a headwind now in this quarter that we're in as well and that will continue on as we kind of go forward. So a significant piece of that really relates to that particular business. FaheemSabeiha: Okay. And how much are you baking in from AxleTech acquisition in 3Q? CarlAnderson: Well, again I would say, we've not kind of given line by line guidance on the revenue, but I would just say the first two quarters that we've seen this year in AxleTech has been running a little bit north of $40 million of revenue. And I would expect - we don't expect probably some little bit further softness for a period of time for that business. FaheemSabeiha: Okay and then you commented a little on the visibility in the back half of the year, but as far as 3Q, I mean, you guys provided a pretty wide band and I'm just curious if that's based solely on orders received thus far as truck production restarts or if there could be some upside later in the quarter? JayCraig: I think it's really almost entirely based on the lack of visibility on the OE manufacturing side. So if you take the business that your questions, Carl, you were just discussing the aftermarket business and Industrial that represents roughly a 50% of our expected revenue in that guidance. So if you took the remaining revenue, we have almost a 50% range of aftermath on the truck OE business. And I think that's very consistent with what we're hearing from our customers both in our private discussions and what you've heard them discussed publicly as they've released their earnings. It's just - it's a very opaque visibility window right now and after this quarter. And so that's why we put as wide range on revenue as we did. But understand this revenue estimate was important for us internally as well because it gave us the markers on which we have to manage the business to achieve our objectives of having the operating cash outflow be a very limited amount. FaheemSabeiha: Yes. Okay. And as far as the 20% to 30% sequential downside earnings convergence, I mean, is that going to be balanced between commercial truck in aftermarket, industrial and trailer to one of those segments will look a little weaker? JayCraig: I don't think where we're providing that level of guidance just given the volatility, I mentioned on the revenue outlook. But what I would make note of is included in that downside sequential guidance is the incremental cost of providing the safety materials that we need to ramp up our production such as masks, face shields, sanitary products, positional cleaning. So there is some incremental cost that's being incurred right now that's outside our norms in running the business. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for any further remarks. Todd Chirillo : Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 conference call. Please reach out to me directly with any questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and media. With that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger. Tom Linebarger : Thank you, James, and good morning. Third quarter continued a period of high demand volatility across our end markets. Three months ago, we experienced the largest sales decline in the company's history. We have now followed that with the largest sequential increase in sales in the company's history. Even with the dramatic increase, however, sales remained below last year's levels. While we have seen increased demand around most of our end markets over the last three months, we continue to see differences in recovery rates, both by market and by region, and we expect these differences to continue. Our employees have done a remarkable job of supporting our customers through this period while maintaining a safe work environment. In the third quarter, our supply chain organization continue to support near record levels of truck production in China, as well as ramping up production to meet significantly increased demand in the North American heavy duty truck, and pickup market. Our engineering group has continued to successfully launch new products during this period, over the last six months we introduced an entire range of broad stage six products in India, and portions of our National Standard VI portfolio in China. We also recently announced our full product lineup to meet EPA 2021 regulations in North America. While nearly everything about the way we have worked -- we work has changed due to COVID-19, the commitment and capability of our employees has remained intact. Now I'll move to a summary of our third quarter results and a discussion of our major end markets. Mark will then take you through more details of our third quarter financial performance and update you on our balance sheet and liquidity. Revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA was $876 million or 17.1%, compared to $958 million or 16.6% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes and higher variable compensation costs was offset by the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions, reduced warranty costs and higher joint venture income. The increase in joint venture income was primarily due to continued strong levels of demand in China. Engine Business revenues declined by 13% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. Lower production in North American truck markets drove most of the revenue decline. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 18.1%, compared to 14.1% for the same period in 2019. Cost savings related to restructuring activities and salary reductions, as well as increased joint venture income, partially offset the impact of lower volumes. Third quarter results also benefited from a VAT recovery in Brazil. Sales for our Distribution segment declined by 14% year-over-year, with lower revenues in domestic and international markets. Third quarter EBITDA was $182 million or 10.6% of sales, compared to 9.3% in the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA margins increased, as we realize more of the benefits of our transformation work in North America. Third quarter revenues for the Components segment declined 7%. Sales in North America declined 24%, driven by lower truck build rates, while revenues in international markets increased by 26%, driven by higher truck demand in China. EBITDA for the third quarter was $261 million or 16.9% compared to 17.3% in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA percent decreased, as the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by the benefits of restructuring and temporary salary reductions. Power Systems sales in the third quarter declined 13% year-over-year. Industrial sales declined 21%, driven by continued weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. Power Generation sales decreased by 7%, with lower revenues in both North America and international markets. EBITDA in the third quarter was 10.3% or $101 million, compared to 14% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes more than offset the benefits of cost reduction actions. In the New Power business, sales of $18 million were double those from a year ago. EBITDA was a loss of $40 million, in line with our expectations. Now I will comment on some of our key regions and markets, starting with North America, and then I\u2019ll cover some of our largest international markets. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 18% to $3 billion, but increased by 49% sequentially. Compared to last year, we experienced lower demand in both on and off highway markets, as well as within our parts and service business. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks declined 35% in the third quarter, compared to a year ago, but rose 119% sequentially. Year-to-date, our market share is 33%, driven by the continued strong performance of our products in the field. Production of medium-duty trucks decreased by 33% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, but increased 76% from second quarter levels. We continue to maintain our clear market share leadership in the medium-duty truck market, with over 80% of new trucks powered by Cummins power trains in 2020. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 4% compared to a year ago, and included a catch-up in production by our OEM partner after an extended second quarter shut down. Demand in domestic bus markets remain weak in the third quarter with sales down, 24%, driven by demand lower demand from both transit and school bus customers. In domestic, our highway market engine sales for construction equipment decreased by 47%, driven by lower demand by rental fleets who went through a significant replenishment cycle in 2018 and 2019. Revenues for power generation equipment fell by 7% with lower demand and backup power market. Demand for engines and oil and gas markets declined by 80%. Now I'll turn to our international markets. International revenues were flat in the third quarter of 2020, compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.7 billion, an increase of 46%, compared to a year ago, driven by continued strong demand in both truck and construction markets. And the third quarter industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China, increased by 74% compared to a year ago. While demand declines sequentially, which is normal in the third quarter for China. Total industry production with the highest on record for any third quarter. Demand continues to be driven by improved levels of freight activity and government policies, supporting the scrapping of old NSV trucks. Our market share was 17% in the quarter, up from 16% in the third quarter of 2019, driven by increased truck market share of our partner Foton, along with higher utilization of our engine in Foton trucks, which now stands at over 80%. Industry sales of light duty trucks, increased by 49% in the third quarter, and our market share was 9%, up from 7% last year, our increased market share was driven by improved truck market share Foton, as well as increased use of our engines and JC, while new NSX regulations come into effect for all markets in China next July, there are certain cities and applications where these regulations are already in place. 12 of our NSX engine models are now in production, including our entire light duty portfolio, as well as our leading 6.7 and 12 liter products. We've shipped over 50,000 NSX compliant units so far in 2020 and are seeing strong acceptance of our new engines. In addition, we are now selling our automated manual transmissions into the Chinese market, and are on track to sell over 1000 Endurant AMTs by the end of the year. Third quarter demand for excavators in China, increased by 57% from a year ago. The central government is encouraging increased levels of borrowing by local municipalities to support investment in infrastructure and housing projects. So far this year over $500 billion in local government loans have been issued, targeting infrastructure projects and resulting in increased excavator demand. Our market share was 16% this quarter compared to 15% a year ago, driven by the strong performance of our domestic OEM customers. Demand for power generation equipment in China was flat compared to a year ago with increased demands on data center customers offset by weaker demand for standby power. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $295 million, a reduction of 14% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck sales in India decreased 47%. While power generation sales declined by 45%. While demand in India remains at very low levels. It's the industry truck sales more than triple compared to second quarter levels. While credit availability remains tight, certain segments of the truck market, especially those tied to construction are seeing a recovery in demand driven by state government stimulus for infrastructure. Cummins is well positioned to benefit from our recovery in Indian markets. Both because of our leading market position, as well as the incremental content we have on engines that meet BSVI on-highway emission standards, which became effective in April. Outside of India and China, we saw a year-over-year revenue declines of 8% in Europe, and 15% in Latin America, primarily due to lower truck production, compared to the second quarter sales \u2013 compared to the second quarter sales increased by 25% in Europe, and increased by 102% in Latin America, as OEMs resumed truck production in both regions. Global sales of mining engines declined 39% compared to a year ago. Demand remains stable among copper and iron ore miners, while sales related to coal mining remained low. I also wanted to discuss our aftermarket revenues during this quarter. Sales of parts declined by 12% in our engine business and 14% in our Power Systems business. Part sales remain depressed in our Power Systems business, due to low demand in oil and gas markets, as well as lower rebuild activity in mining markets. In our engine business, parts sales were down 12% year-over-year for increased 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we are seeing weaker demand in bus markets and parts for older model trucks. Parts demand for current on-highway truck engines are flat with last year. While demand increased from second quarter levels across most of our end markets, we remain cautious about future demand increases due to the continued spread of COVID-19 in most countries outside of Asia. And while we are encouraged by continued strong demand in China and improving fundamentals in North American truck markets, industry backlogs remain at modest levels. We currently expect consolidated company revenues in the fourth quarter to be similar to third quarter levels, with higher demand in North American truck markets and continued improvement in aftermarket sales, partially offset by lower demand in China. We continue to expect that the pace of market recovery will differ from region-to-region and may change based on government actions, both to control the spread of COVID-19 or to stimulate their economies and build business and consumer confidence. We continue working hard to support our end users and build our \u2013 build strong OEM relationships during this period. In August, we announced the extension of our medium and heavy-duty truck engine partnership with Navistar. Cummins will continue to supply engines for Navistar's medium and heavy-duty trucks as well as for bus applications through the end of 2026, extending our 80-year relationship with Navistar. Through the development and introduction of new products, we continue to reduce the emissions levels of our products while increasing fuel economy. This includes the launch of our full product lineup for 2021 EPA regulations in North America and NSVI regulations in China and BSVI regulations in India. We are encouraged by the performance and market acceptance of these products that are already in the field. We also continue to focus on supporting our customers in their transition to carbon-neutral technologies. Our revenues doubled in our new Power Segment this quarter, and we are excited to share more about how we expect our hydrogen production and fuel cell business to develop at Cummins Hydrogen Day on November 16. We hope you all will be able to attend this virtual event. Now let me turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial performance this quarter, including our record operating cash flow. Mark? Mark Smith : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I would like you to leave this call with two key takeaways from our financial performance in the third quarter. Number one, we delivered solid decremental margins in the third quarter, which put us on track for full year performance that will extend our record of raising profitability over successive downturns. This performance is a testament to our operational flexibility, ramping down effectively in the second quarter and then converting additional volume into stronger earnings and record operating cash flow in the third quarter. Number two is a result of the record operating cash flows and the addition of low-cost, long-term financing in the third quarter, the company sits today with strong liquidity, which will allow us to keep investing in our future in the face of any further volatility and return any excess capital to shareholders in the future. Now, let me share some of the key details of our third quarter. Third quarter revenues were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America fell 18%, and international revenues were flat. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%, primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real. Earnings before interest and taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $876 million or 17.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $958 million or 16.6% of sales a year ago, representing a decremental EBITDA of 13%. EBITDA dollars decreased by $82 million over the third quarter last year, driven by the negative impact of lower sales, partially offset by the benefits of prior restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions, lower warranty and material costs and increased joint venture income in China. During the quarter, we recorded a recovery of previously expensed value-added taxes in Brazil, which boosted revenues and pre-tax earnings by $44 million and primarily benefited the engine business. The variable compensation expense in the third quarter was higher than a year ago as we increased our accrual, reflecting higher expectations for full year company profitability than we anticipated three months ago. For the full year 2020, variable compensation is projected to be lower than 2019. Gross margin of $1.3 billion, or 26.4% of sales, increased by 50 basis points from a year ago. Lower base compensation expense due to the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary cuts, material cost reductions and the VAT recovery in Brazil, more than offset the impact of lower sales and higher variable compensation expense. As a reminder, our gross margin last year was negatively impacted by $37 million in pre-tax charges, as we exited two unprofitable product lines. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $67 million or 11% due to the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary expenses, partially offset by the increased overall compensation. Research expenses decreased by $18 million or 7% from a year ago, but increased by $35 million or 19% from the second quarter, as expected, as we ramped up work at our global technical centers and continued progress on engineering programs following some disruption to operations in the second quarter. Joint venture income increased by $30 million, but driven by continued strong demand for trucks in China, and joint venture income in China was a record for the third quarter, as we converted those higher volumes into strong earnings. Other income of $21 million decreased by $40 million compared to a year ago. Last year, we recognized a onetime $35 million cash gain related to the company's foreign exchange hedging program, which did not repeat this year. Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $622 million or $3.97 a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5%, and income tax expense included unfavorable discrete items of $31 million or $0.21 per diluted share.  After a tough second quarter, operating cash flow rebounded to a record inflow of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong profitability and lower working capital levels. Our inventory decreased by $185 million in the quarter, even as sales increased 33% from second quarter levels. Capital expenditures was $116 million in the quarter, down from $153 million a year ago. We expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $500 million to $525 million, unchanged from our prior guidance and down more than 25% from 2019. We continue to return cash to shareholders in the third quarter with $194 million of cash dividends paid out. In August, the company completed an aggregate $2 billion debt offering of 5, 10 and 30-year maturities, taking advantage of extremely attractive long-term interest rates that reflected both favorable market conditions and our own strong credit rating. This long-term financing was used in part to pay down our commercial paper borrowings and reduces our reliance on credit facilities going forward. Company's long-term credit ratings remain unchanged at A+ from Standard and Poor's and A2 from Moody's with stable outlooks  As a result of our strong operating cash flow and the debt offering, we boosted our total liquidity to $6.5 billion at the end of September, which puts Cummins in a strong position to navigate any further volatility that may lie ahead. In October, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend, our 11th straight year of dividend growth. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to remain similar to third quarter levels. Strong industry orders are expected to lead to strong demand in North American truck markets and improved aftermarket demand. India has shown some signs of improvement from very low levels in demand as the lockdowns have been eased and some economic activities increasing. In China, where demand has been at record levels over the last 6 months, we expect to experience some seasonal declines in the fourth quarter, but demand remained at relatively strong levels. The temporary salary reduction that went into effect in mid-April ended at the end of September as planned. The restoration of salaries will add approximately $90 million of pretax expenses in the fourth quarter. In summary, we delivered a strong set of results in the third quarter, including record operating cash flow. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their dedication and commitment to excellence through these last 6 very challenging months. Following unprecedented decline in demand in the second quarter, we responded well in ramping back up in the third quarter, supporting our customers and maintaining financial discipline throughout. While many of our markets have improved, the effects of the pandemic can still be felt in many regions and may impact the pace of recovery. We will continue to align our business with market conditions, deliver strong operational performance, invest in the technologies that will fuel profitable growth and return any excess capital to shareholders. Finally, as Tom previously mentioned, we'll be holding our Hydrogen Day on November 16th, where we will highlight our participation in hydrogen economy. Additional details and registration can be found on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Cummins. Now let me turn it back to James. James Hopkins : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a related follow-up, and if you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're now ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Stephen Volkmann : Thank you. Mark Smith : Hello? Stephen Volkmann : Can you guys hear me okay? Mark Smith : Yeah, obviously. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, good. Sorry. So yeah, my question, maybe this is a Mark question, I don't know, but I'm trying to just see if I can disaggregate your temporary cost activities from your restructuring benefits? And obviously, I'm trying to start to think about 2021 and figure out what you get to keep and kind of what you have to give back. Can you give us some help with that? Mark Smith : You'll remember that we implemented a temporary salary reductions in the middle of April, Steve. So when you do the math, it's about $165 million of full year lower expenses in 2020. Obviously, that will not repeat. We've restored those salaries in the fourth quarter. The restructuring, I mean, is embedded in our solid decremental margins. And again, we don't have any further major restructuring actions in place, but we have captured the benefits of that $250 million to $300 million in the current year as anticipated. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. I guess what -- that's sort of where I'm trying to go, Mark, is how should we think about incremental margins, assuming there's some small increment next year? Low decrementals, kind of maybe employ low incrementals, but maybe not if you're getting a good chunk of restructuring benefits. Mark Smith : Yeah. I think, just at this point, so it's a very -- I understand the question. It's just too early even to assess our market conditions next year. But you will -- you can see from our results today that we're pushing on all the levers, productivity gains that we can. It's just too early beyond the obvious items to comment much on next year. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, thanks. Worth a try. Appreciate it. Mark Smith : Thank you. James Hopkins : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Courtney Yakavonis : Hi, thanks guys. If you can just comment a little bit more on the guidance that 4Q revenues would be similar to 3Q relative to kind of some of the strength we saw in the international markets versus the increases that we're expecting in North America, if you can just help us understand that? And then relative to what you're expecting in parts relative to the engine side? Thanks. Mark Smith : So the strength in international market, all being flat, lower down to China, right. There really wasn't any strength to speak of elsewhere in terms of year-over-year growth. There was steady recovery in some markets. But any part of our business that touch China, whether within the component business, even our construction business, within the engine business, data center orders for the power systems, anything that touch China was pretty much up year-over-year. And so that's really what \u2013 you're all flat international revenues for the quarter. It's typical currently that we see some seasonal weakening going into the third \u2013 into the fourth quarter every year in China. So we still expect relative to prior year, strong demand but weaker sequentially, primarily impacting the components business since all \u2013 pretty much all of their revenue was consolidated, and then to a lesser extent, the Engine business. So that's the primary market where we're expecting some seasonal declines. And then yes, truck production build rates, I think, are largely set for the fourth quarter. And then yes, on parts, what we saw in the second quarter was particularly some weaker demand in the bus market, truck parts, particularly on newer model, heavy-duty truck was stable in the third quarter, and we expect steadily improving parts demand in subsequent quarters. The big factor is really China easing, and we're not expecting rapid further acceleration in truck demand right now. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now live. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess two questions. First, the margins in the Distribution business improved again in the third quarter. So can you talk about how to think about those margins longer term, sort of what's structural based on some of the internal self-help you guys have been implementing? And then my second question, Mark, understanding you guys are always conservative, but you are sitting with $3 billion or so in cash. So how do you think about cash flow for the year? What's the right number? At what point do we, you know, start to thinking about putting that cash to use? Thanks. Mark Smith : Good. Yes, so you're right. And I'll start on Distribution, Tony, if you want to chime in. We have had a very focused effort, particularly in North America, on driving margin improvement, a lot of it's coming out of the cost side of the business, this years we've been pleased with the progress this year Jamie. I think then, you know, then we're really looking to see, you know, as parts and service which, you know, have been down, probably more, more than in prior cycles due to the severity of the impact of COVID. How that recovers in future years. So I think, we've made a lot of progress in the margin improvement over the last couple of years. We certainly expect to hang on to that. And then we'll be looking to build on revenue growth going forward. So avoid given a specific target Tony? Tony Satterthwaite : Yes, I would just add Jamie, you know, revenue has been a little weaker in this downturn and DBU than previous downturns. And so we've been really pleased with the cost performance and the restructuring and focusing going forward is going to be on how do we see better revenue growth as that business comes back? And how do we gain some share in the parts and service business in particular? So that's what we're looking for more about how do we get that business back to a higher revenue level than necessarily trying to get margins up. Jamie Cook : Okay. But is there any reason to believe the margins can structurally sort of be now in the double-digit range on an adjusted EBITDA basis? Tony Satterthwaite : That has been our goal. That's what we said when we launched this transformation program. So that's what we're trying to do is keep them in the double-digit level going forward. That's our goal. Yes. Jamie Cook : Okay. Mark, and then on your cash \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Tom Linebarger : Yes, it's Tom. I mean just to make sure I get them \u2013 you get the math right. So our view that we are already in double digits, while facing -- yes, we had some cost -- temporary cost measures that helped, but we had way more headwinds with regard to both sales and then parts and service decline. So our view is that, that we are on our plan despite pretty heavy headwinds. So we are not only feeling good about where we are, but we're more confident than ever that we're going to be in double-digit margins from now forward. So again, you can imagine some scenarios with COVID that would make it so you might have a quarter or 2 that weren't. But broadly speaking, our view is the restructuring stuff has gone better than we expected. So we \u2013 as Tony said, that was our target, and we feel like we're ahead of target. So that's just -- on the cash side, I'll let Mark fill in some more. But I mean, broadly speaking, we've definitely acted conservatively from a balance sheet this year to protect ourselves against the worst potential outcomes -- economic outcomes from the pandemic. So we've shored up the balance sheet with our debt offering, low cost financing, our cash flow has improved dramatically. So we feel good about the position the company is in and expect, barring some significant change in economic conditions, to return to our cash flow plans that we've been operating under for many years. So our plan is to go back to returning as a normalized level, half of our cash flow in dividends and share buybacks. We still have to take all that stuff to the Board. We have to finish our planning work for next year. There's a lot of work left to do. And of course, there's still a pandemic. So we'll keep watching and paying attention. But right now, as we see it, that's where we're headed. Mark, I don't know what you would add. Mark Smith : Yes. I think we've made it clear, we're not trying to hold cash a little -- being cautious this year but I think Tom has made it clear going forward. Jamie Cook : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research. Your line is now live. Adam Uhlman : Hey guys. Good morning. I was hoping to get your perspective on heavy truck markets. I guess we've seen this spike in spot rates and the orders have been soaring. I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable do you think that is? And most of your customers are looking for pretty aggressive build growth in the next year. I guess maybe you could frame up your thoughts on how the cycle plays out from here that would be helpful. Tom Linebarger : Tony? Tony Satterthwaite : Sure, Adam. We're all waiting. Sorry. We're not together, Adam. So this is Tony. Yes. It's been very pleasing to see the growth, particularly in the last couple of months. I think the thing to remember is that the virus is still with us. And although we are very encouraged, I also think we're very cautious about how the market is going to play out next year. I do think that there is a view that demand is higher, the newer trucks and newer products are definitely working better. We get really good feedback from customers. And we've got new products coming out next year that meet the latest greenhouse gas emissions for EPA 2021. So we're excited with the products we have on offer. Our OEM customers are feeling pretty bullish. But at the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. And so we're just -- we're trying to be prudent. We're trying to keep our eye on all the things going on and make sure that we are ready if things come in stronger and we're prepared if things all of a sudden take a downturn. So the main characteristic of this COVID environment is unpredictability and volatility. And so we're just trying to be ready for that as best we can. Mark Smith : I'll just say, Adam, the other thing we look at is really the parts consumption, because in prior cycles, this one may not be the same as prior cycles. In prior cycles, we've had a pretty good run of accelerating parts consumption before orders sustainably stepped up. So that's something, we're watching closely by segment and end market. And that should give you some indication from us and other participants in future quarters. Adam Uhlman : Okay. Got you. And then Mark, the \u2013 with these new products coming out for 2021, I guess, the company has been benefiting from lower warranty expense, and there's some structural actions going on there. Should we expect a pause in lower warranty expense next year, or do you think we have more legs lower as you execute on your strategic initiatives? Thanks. Mark Smith : Thanks, Adam. Really good question. I think on the one end, of course, we're always driving for more improvement, but I would say that our expenses at 1.8% or 1.9% of sales for this year have run below expectations. And the principal drivers of the warranty performance are field performance of existing products, field campaigns, and then over a longer period of time, changing emission regulations and then the launch of new products. So \u2013 you're right, the launch of new products will continue. We typically start those with higher warranty rates. And this year, the number of field campaigns has been below normal. So we would expect even some tick up in the fourth quarter. And yes, probably, we shouldn't be looking in 1.8% for now as a run rate. So yeah, we'll provide you with an update on that when we get into next year, some tick up from here should be expect \u2013 we even expected something this quarter. But that's where we are right now. Adam Uhlman : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Joel Tiss : Hi. How is it going guys? Tom Linebarger : Hi, Joe. Joel Tiss : I wonder, Tony, or \u2013 can you talk a little bit about any product lines that have been, like, systematically challenged? And I'm thinking over a couple of years, not just because of this. And any areas that you could like do product line simplification and reduce some of that exposure to drive the gross margins higher, or you're always doing that, and there's nothing that really stands out? Tony Satterthwaite : Hey, Joe, I'll go first. I think we did some of that last year, right? So we ended production of one of our engine platforms in the pickup market in North America, which not only \u2013 we took a charge this time last year, but that's also improved our operating performance year-over-year, and similarly in one of the transmission lines of business. So yeah, we're always looking at things like that. But I would say, don't see any major changes like that. But there's always some opportunity to trim and prune and improve we would never. Joel Tiss : And I wonder if you can talk about the M&A environment out there and what you guys are focused on is \u2013 is everything so disrupted that it's not the right time to be looking, or maybe because things are disrupted, there are some unique opportunities? And what area would you be thinking about? Tom Linebarger : I think \u2013 it's Tom. I can step in on that. I mean, for sure, in the second quarter, we were on pause a little bit, making sure that our balance sheet was shored up. But with all the potential outcomes, we took a pause. But things, as I mentioned to Jamie's question, I think things have begun to normalize, at least economically to a place where we feel pretty secure in our balance sheet. And we're looking at restarting our cash flow return, and we will -- of course, we have continued actively looking at the strategic areas where acquisitions would be interesting to us. You probably wrote a call from our previous calls or Investor Day that we kind of start with strategy first, acquisition second. So we think through what are the areas that we'd like to expand in. And we've talked about those before, but they're all the areas where we feel like our competitive advantages, the things that we bring in terms of technology, global footprint, supply chain, that sort of thing, help us move forward. And then, of course, our new technology areas, the acquisitions like we did with Hydrogenics and battery companies, those were to add new capabilities. So, we're continuing to look in those same areas. I think maybe the one comment I would make is that I expected, given the disruption for valuations to be lower today, so I was -- as you -- kind of like the basis of your question, I expect it, maybe disruption would cause valuations to drop out a little bit. That's actually not happened so much. It doesn't mean that it won't happen, but -- and it's maybe because of the private equity dollars are so large. But I would say as we look around using disciplined method to look at what acquisition would mean for our company. I still see acquisition prices relatively lofty. So, we'll continue to look, and we're continuing to talk to people and look for the right thing. But we will just -- we'll remain disciplined and look for the right things at the right price, and we find it, we'll act. And if we don't, we'll return more cash to shareholders just like we planned. Joel Tiss : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning everyone. Tom Linebarger : Hi. Mark Smith : Hey Jerry. Jerry Revich : Tom, now that a number of your customers have sharpened their pencils, at least publicly on their hydrogen and alternative vehicle strategies, are they any closer to allocating lower volume diesel engine product lines to you? Can you talk about, if you can, which regions or which product lines you see the most potential for you folks to add value for customers that have lower volumes in those areas? Tom Linebarger : Jerry, here's the thing. I would say that every customer that we're talking to is doing exactly that pencil sharpening calculations that you talked about. It's a really different environment than it was 10 or 15 years ago, or the calculations were maybe the opposite about how to backward integrate more. Mostly what I hear is maybe backward integrate less. But that said, there's no deal until there's a deal, right? So, again, I can't really preannounce or suggest anyone who's going to go because they're -- they're difficult decisions for them to figure out what they want to continue and what they don't. I feel very optimistic that we'll play an increasing role with our major customers on selling them more diesel engines, providing them more components technology in the future than the past. So, I expect market share increase in the future based on the fact that they will decide that their money be spent elsewhere. Exactly where and when, again, I just -- I can't get ahead of my customers on those conversations, but we're talking with everybody about it. We're excited about it. And they have a lot of strategic considerations to make as do we. So, these conversations are complicated in -- and take time. But anyway, there you are. We're in it for sure, and we're -- and I'm confident that we will win increased share. Jerry Revich : I appreciate the color. And Mark, as we look at the fourth quarter sales outlook, flattish sales. Normal seasonality is closer to up 7% sequentially. And you mentioned China, but obviously, North America and other regions are accelerating. So I'm just wondering, are you expecting a slowdown versus normal seasonality, or is it the sort of situation where, look, where \u2013 could get hit by the second wave, and we don't want to get into a situation where if it's worse, we're missing numbers. Is there some conservatism in there or other pieces that you're legitimately concerned with? Mark Smith : Yes. The numbers will be what the numbers will be, Jerry. I mean we've been very focused on cost. And then Tony and the team are on this incredible ramp back up again. But let's just use the pickup truck market as an example. If you just said at Q3 in isolation, you would see that, that's in the top 10 quarters in history of pickup truck engine demand. But if you do look back at Q2, you would say it's 0, right? So you just can't normalize everything that happened in Q3 and say, flat means everything is flat. So I think there will be some rebalancing in some markets. But again, we'll see where it is. Our focus is on cost and delivery and then delivering the calendar results that go with whatever volume were thrown them. Tom Linebarger : And Jerry as Tony said, we are encouraged by tough market. As these clients said to us, all of customers are projecting stronger volumes which is great for us. So yes we are always cautious, because that\u2019s how we live. But nonetheless we are encouraged by their comments and their vehicles to the market, they are watching fleet customer and what they're ordering, and we're hearing good things from the fleets, too. So yes, we are very encouraged. In China, while we expect seasonal demand, we don't expect a gigantic drop off. We just expect seasonal demand normal. It's just the thing is flying so high now that -- again, we just remain cautious. So just don't hear from us discouragement. We are \u2013 the markets are going well, and we're surprised and pleased by how strong they are, and we're encouraged by those. We're just trying to make sure that we balance our enthusiasm with the cautious attitude that's appropriate for a global pandemic. Jerry Revich : Glad to hear. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. David Raso : Hi, thank you. My question is on engine margins for next year, just thinking about the framework, Tom, and given your China comments just now. I'm trying to square up, it looks like next year, you have sort of a sweet spot of strong growth but not yet at those extremely high levels where sometimes there's inefficiency serving the domestic truck market. So on a consolidated margin basis, I'm just curious how you think about the margin structurally versus, say, 2019? Just some sense of what we might not get back to those revenues, are the domestic margins set up in a way where they could be maybe a little closer to '19 than otherwise, given some bit of a sweet spot. But then within the segment, you do have the JV income, which is a big contributor. And thus, maybe if you could share your initial views on '21 for China as that business is debatable, if it's up or not next year. So I just would appreciate your thoughts for an early framework on '21 engine margins? Tom Linebarger : Well, within China, there are a number of moving parts, David that will add to the complexity. We're expecting a bigger step-up in the penetration of NS VI products. What that will happen to demand. The take up is all to be figured out there. So yeah, we're not in a position right now to give you 2021. I guess Q3 margins were higher than normal for a couple of the factors that we've laid out. But we're still going through our planning cycle for next year as we speak. So not as we speak, but after we speak here, we'll be back on that again here shortly. So it's just too early to say, given everything that's going on. Look, I would just say we are very pleased with performance of the engine business and the fact that they were able to deliver such strong margins in this very, very challenging environment. And I think it speaks to the strength of the global franchise and the scale we've got in multiple markets, obviously, North America and China has been primary. But yeah, we're not ready to give guidance next year. I appreciate you're asking. We'll look forward to giving an update with Q4 earnings. David Raso : Would you mind just to clarify there, just given how high China is today, maybe while you don't want to predict the industry, I'm curious -- and you've given some numbers in the past, But now we're a little bit closer, the incremental content, some of the opportunities are idiosyncratic to the company. If there is a thought that China's volumes are so high this year, they're down next year, but maybe you have some self-help offsets. Can you give us some framework, as we've discussed in the past, but now closer to it? What kind of potentially framework revenue impact you could see that is from better NS VI content or increase with photon and so forth? Can you help us a little bit, just frame it? Mark Smith : Yeah. I'll just make a couple of comments, and then James can maybe give you some numbers. But I think this, kind of, couple of dynamics. One, so there's the potential -- or the expectation of higher content for the components business on a consolidated revenue basis. As the emissions regulations are rolled out, that's kind of a given, given that we saw -- we specify the after-treatment systems are an integral part of our engine system design. James will give you the numbers in a moment. We hope then, as we move in through these more advanced missions regulations, that we can continue to pick up share. We feel like our NS VI products have been well received. And our penetration of photon has already been really accelerating over the last couple of years. We're already up to 80%. And it's encouraging to see photons been picking up some share as well. So yes, we're optimistic about, if we set aside the market, which, of course, markets do drive earnings as well, but our position and our ability to add self-help there. And James, you can maybe quantify the revenues. James Hopkins : Yeah. And David, from a revenue impact of that, we've talked broadly before, both between the emissions content in China and in India. That will be roughly $600 million of incremental revenue, and that primarily hits our component segment. I think in addition to that, Tom mentioned in his remarks excitement about the endurant transmission that we're selling 1,000 units out in the second half of this year. We'll see continued growth of that product in China next year, which will provide customers with even improved fuel economy and hopefully to more market share gains. And so I think that is also some self-help as we look into 2021. Tom Linebarger : David, this is Tom. As you kind of think through the model, the numbers for this year are so high in the truck market. This is what Mark's saying that right now, it's just hard for us to do that. The weighing one or the other because we know what the content is. We know we've won the share with. We even have forecast for how we think it converts over to NS VI and what growth we see in transmissions. The challenge is just what's the overall market going to be. And we were wrong this year. I mean just to say it straight out, we had pretty balanced assumptions about how well this year would be, and we've been wrong every single quarter on the low side. It's been better than every single quarter. So that's why we're just a little gun shy about doing the overall balance for you. We will do it, of course, when we get done with fourth quarter earnings. But I just would say that, we're hopeful that we can offset a downturn with a lot of these other content pieces, but it just depends on how big the slope down is. David Raso : Yes. I mean that's what's interesting, Tom. I mean historically, your order book could be accelerating every time on the call, you want to say, well, China is going to slow down. And a lot of times, it doesn't. And in this environment, you'd almost say we're at such a high level. And you've seen Volvo and so forth already forecast China down next year. You know, betting man would have said like, well, knowing Tom's history or the way he looks at China, just trying to be cautious with it. And we'll definitely be hearing today baseline \u2013 oh, it's definitely down. It seems like what you're seeing enough internally in your own opportunities, it's still an open question, which estimates a little more positive than I would have thought. Tom Linebarger : So yes, you're right about it. You're right, David. It is an open question, and I appreciate your comments, and I do acknowledge that I have been calling it down more than it has been. So I'll just take that one \u2013 and accept it. That hasn't been right. And so anyway, I think it's a good point you raise. David Raso : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Ann Duignan : Yes. Hi, I'd like to go back to Q4. I mean you've guided to revenue flattish quarter-over-quarter. You called out $90 million in higher compensation expenses. You mentioned perhaps warranty costs coming back up. Could you talk about some of the positives and negatives that we ought to consider beyond those or quantify maybe the warranty impact as we head into Q4? Just so we don't assume that EBITDA is flat, also minus the $90 million. What else should we take into consideration? Mark Smith : Yes. I mean, there's really three main things. There's \u2013 you've got the $90 million \u2013 it's likely there's some increase in the warranty expense in the fourth quarter. And then, as I said in my prepared remarks, we trued up our variable compensation in the third quarter to catch up for our higher expectation. So I think it's unlikely now that we'll be showing up again in the fourth quarter. JV income, despite all the comments just passed, directionally, I would expect that still to be a little bit lighter in China, just based on seasonality. It's still very strong, just to be clear, year-over-year, but just weaker into the fourth quarter. So those are really the big moving parts. And other than the volume \u2013 and we've converted that well when we've received it this year. Tom Linebarger : Yes. And we hope the volume being higher in the North America truck market is net positive towards incremental margins, too. It's a good market for us. And we're operating at a reasonably efficient level, especially given all the challenges as COVID. We're operating at a good level on North American truck market. So we're hopeful that, that also helps us some. Ann Duignan : Okay. And I think you mentioned also on distribution. If aftermarket were to continue to accelerate, that should be a positive for mix also. Is that a fair statement? Mark Smith : It is a first statement, and it would benefit a number of businesses, but particularly distribution, yes. Ann Duignan : Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there. As most of my other questions are answered. Appreciate it. Tom Linebarger : Thanks, Ann. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Ross Gilardi : Good morning, guys. Tom Linebarger : Hi, Ross. Mark Smith : Hi. How are you? Ross Gilardi : Okay. Great. Thank you. Look, clearly, your overall results are very strong and very impressive. I realize that engines from mining and energy are not big parts of your company anymore, so sorry to focus there. I missed the strong quarter, but wanted to get your perspective on those two end markets. And I think you said, mining engine shipments were down 39%. Was that actually worse in the second quarter? You mentioned coal, and are you starting to view mining or energy as more structurally challenged end markets for Cummins, or is this just a cyclical downturn like prior downturns? And just beyond that, is there any real hope for a real pickup in either mining or energy in 2021, or do these businesses potentially get worse or just kind of flat line at a low level before they get better? Mark Smith : James will do the numbers for you, Ross, just to confirm, first of all. James Hopkins : Yes. Ross, so on the mining engine sales side, as you mentioned, third quarter revenues were very similar to second quarter in the mining overall. And as you mentioned, we continue to see relatively stable demand in miners that are going to be focused more on iron ore and copper and continued weak demand along the coal side of things. But we were flat sequentially on the mining revenues. Ross Gilardi : And oil and gas was de minimis? James Hopkins : Yes. Oil and gas, very de minimis. So sales in North America at this point on the oil and gas side for new engines, almost nothing. And we've also continued to see very weak demand in oil and gas markets in relation to rebuilds, really kind of highlighting the fact that there are rigs that are not currently being utilized in the market. Tom Linebarger : And, Ross, maybe just stepping back, I would just say that from a mining point of view, I don't think we see it as a structurally challenged market. Well, it's challenged in the following sense. There tends to be over shots and under shots a lot in the market. You know that well, and you know a lot of mining companies overshot by a lot in the last cycle and really got knocked back hard. And so needless to say, they're all being careful, not overshooting now, which has meant that equipment buying has been more muted, even in good markets, than it was in the previous cycle. So our expectation of the cycle was that it wasn't going to be as good as the last one, I'm sure enough it hasn't been at all. And of course, just general economic demand being dampened, confidence in future demand being dampened by the pandemic has meant that mining is indeed slow. And I think it really won't get a lot stronger until there's confidence built in global economic growth, which means the end of the pandemic. I mean really, I just don't see a way that it changes. Energy is a whole another conversation and energy has a lot more structural challenge to it, but I'm not the right one to answer it. As you say, we have a participation there, not a huge one. And so, I think, it's better for someone else to comment on that. But it looks more structurally challenged to me than some of the other markets. Ross Gilardi : Yes. Thank you. James Hopkins : Okay, great. I think with that, that -- sorry. Operator : I'll turn the floor back over to you for any further or closing comments. Tom Linebarger : Great. Thank you for that. So, again, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for taking the time to call in today. Appreciate that, as always, and for your continued interest in Cummins. And I'll be available for any follow-up questions here this afternoon. Mark Smith : And let me add my thanks to James. I really appreciate your attention. I'm sorry that I did not invite my dog [ph] to this quarterly call. I'll try t include her on future calls, but it was nice to have a noise-free call. Thank you very much for your attention. Bye-bye. Tom Linebarger : Thanks everyone. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Todd Chirillo : Thank you, Jewel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, all of whom will be available for questions following the call. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay. Jay Craig : Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before we review our results, I would like to take a moment to address the leadership transition plan we announced last week. After nearly 6 years as CEO, I will transition to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board on February 28. At that time, Chris Villavarayan, our Chief Operating Officer, has been selected to succeed me as Meritor's next CEO and President. Additionally, Bill Newlin, our current Chairman, will become the lead Director of the Board. Since I assumed the CEO position, we have made great strides through execution of our M2016, M2019 and now our M2022 plans. We have advanced our innovation and product portfolio, strengthened our financial foundation and created a collaborative and diverse organization that fosters growth. M2022 is well underway and we are seeing signs of recovery in our business and industry since the onset of COVID-19, which I'll touch upon more later. That said, we believe now is the ideal time to set in motion our long-term succession plan. Many of you know Chris, who has been lit Meritor for more than 2 decades and is an integral member of our leadership team. He has had a significant impact on our company during his tenure, and this transition represents a natural next step. On a personal note, Chris has been a true partner to me, helping to execute our successful and plans. In the months ahead, I will continue to lead Meritor and work closely with Chris as we prepare for a smooth transition. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 3. Obviously, our fourth quarter and full year results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes due to the pandemic. However, we were able to partly offset the impact on our margin for the quarter and for the year, with the cost-reduction actions we implemented in the second half. Carl will give you more detail on the results, but the important takeaway here is the extent to which we are able to preserve our financial stability, considering the significance of the headwind created by COVID-19. As you see in the center of the slide, we're able to execute well on an approximate 50% increase in sales sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth, with a conversion rate of 22%. All things considered, we recovered from the crisis exceptionally well. We took aggressive actions to protect the company financially, and most importantly, we took immediate steps to protect our employees while it worked. While certain countries and states where we have operations are experiencing rising case counts, we remain fully operational globally with no limitations at this time. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the pandemic required a great deal of management attention in 2020, we still had many achievements that support all aspects of M2022. Our safety, quality and delivery metrics were excellent. With regard to safety, the total recordable case rate was 0.57 per 200,000 hours worked with more than 50% of our facilities reporting 0 recordables for the year. We believe this makes us one of the safest global manufacturers in the world. This speaks volumes for our team's commitment to each other and is certainly one of the accomplishments I am most proud of during my tenure. We are honored to receive Daimler's coveted Global Supplier Award this year for providing more than 1 million axles, brakes and drive lines, with excellent quality and parts per million rates during the peak 2019 North American market. In addition, we are able to repurchase 10.4 million shares in fiscal 2020, were added to the S&P 600 SmallCap Index and announced 4 footprint actions, 3 in the United States and 1 in Europe. We expect these actions to generate annual run rate savings of approximately $10 million and give us added confidence to achieving our M2022 objectives. In July, we celebrated production of our 100 millionth remanufactured brake shoe. With nearly 50% of remanufactured brake shoe production in North America, Meritor is the industry leader. We continue to win new business with important customers and later in the discussion, Carl will review our expected outperformance against the M2022 new business target. And finally, we received approval from our Board for an incremental $30 million to industrialize medium and heavy applications for our ePowertrain portfolio, more on that in a moment. On Slide 5, you will see additional detail related to the long-term agreement we signed with Daimler. This is an important contract for us that extends our relationship with Daimler through 2027 and will now put Meritor in standard position for air disc brakes on the Freightliner Cascadia through 2025. Let's look at Slide 6 for an update on electrification. Essentially, the takeaway here is that we will be in production with our electric powertrain in 2021. The picture on this slide was taken recently at our EE powertrain assembly operation. We are very excited that we are only months away from delivering under the contract we secured with PACCAR for its heavy-duty electric trucks. In advance of production, the 14Xe is already receiving industry acclaim. Earlier this year, we told you we were recognized as a 2020 PACEpilot Honoree by Automotive News for our Blue Horizon electrification solutions. And recently, Meritor received the Diesel Progress Achievement of the Year and Electric Application of the Year awards. We believe we will be the first supplier to begin production of electric powertrains for Class 8 electric vehicles, and we anticipate additional production contracts in 2021. Let's go to the next slide. As you know, customers have numerous electric drivetrain solutions to consider. We are often asked about the remote mount architecture versus the electric powertrain. Meritor's electric powertrain is revolutionary and that we are taking an electric motor and a multi-speed transmission and integrating them into the carrier. We are not just bolting on a motor. This design is fully integrated and designed to maximize efficiency, performance, weight savings and space utilization. By partnering with the leading motor technology companies in the world, we have designed the electric motor from the ground up to meet and exceed customer expectations and performance targets. And since this technology is based on Meritor's traditional 14X axle design manufacturing is easier, and OEMs can integrate it into existing chassis using the same mounting locations and hardware. Although we are prepared to deliver e-optimized axles for remote mount solutions, Meritor's class-leading integrated powertrain architecture is beginning to be the product of choice within the commercial vehicle industry. We believe we've developed the most advanced electric powertrain for medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles in the industry and that it will be game-changing. On this slide, we have provided the hotlink to meritor.com, where you can get an inside look at the e powertrain production at our plants in addition to a video that shows the differences between the architectures I described. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carl. Carl Anderson : Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, provide fiscal year 2021 outlook and provide an update on our M2022 financial goals. Now let's walk through our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck decreased by just over $200 million year-over-year. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower volumes in most markets due to COVID-19. While volumes were down year-over-year, we did see production increase throughout the quarter as we began to recover from the shutdowns earlier in the year. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $24 million, down $48 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 4.3%, down 500 basis points from a year ago. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower market volumes. In addition, we increased our electrification spend by $6 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by cost-reduction actions primarily executed in the second half of the year, lower incentive compensation and operational performance. Aftermarket industrial sales were $226 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, down 22% compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower volumes in our North America aftermarket specialty and defense businesses. Aftermarket sales were also negatively impacted by $36 million due to the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. While revenues were lower, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 15% from 14.2% in the prior year. The margin increase was driven by cost-reduction actions, lower incentive compensation and operational performance, which more than offset lower volume. For the full year, revenue came in just north of $3 billion, down 31% from the same period last year. The revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower market volumes across our segments due to COVID-19. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $244 million compared to $290 million in the prior year. We did incur $27 million of restructuring expense in 2020 due to the headcount reduction programs executed throughout the year. This was partially offset by $203 million of after-tax income associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement in fiscal year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million in fiscal year 2020, translating to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.12, down from $3.82 in the prior year. Finally, free cash flow is $180 million in 2020. This does include the benefit of $265 million in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement. Excluding this impact, free cash flow was negative $85 million for the full year. Keep in mind, this includes the impact from our factoring programs that were down $77 million this year due primarily from lower European revenue. As markets begin to recover, this will be a tailwind for free cash flow as we move forward. Next, I'll review our key balance sheet metrics on Slide 9. We ended the fiscal year with a strong liquidity position of over $1 billion, which is up almost $200 million from last year. Our cash on hand is $315 million, which is more than we typically hold. Given the current environment, we believe it is prudent to run higher cash balances at this time. Our funded status and our pension plans also significantly improved, and we are now in a net global overfunding status on our plans. It is important to note that we achieved this milestone without any cash contributions over the past several years. Our long-term liability driven investment strategy and strong asset returns drove the increase in the funding status. Moving to our debt maturity profile. We have no significant maturities for the next 3 years. We recently called the remaining $23 million of 7.875% convertible debt which upon completion will reduce both our outstanding debt and the share dilution associated with its convertible instrument. Furthermore, our 2024 bonds are currently callable, which provides further flexibility to be opportunistic in managing our debt profile. Additionally, while our leverage is expected to be above our target range in the near term, we do expect to deploy capital to begin to pay down debt in the second half of 2021. Next, I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 10. You will notice we are giving market ranges wider than our typical guidance. While most global markets point to recovery in 2021, we are prudently planning for a variety of scenarios. In the North America Class 8 market, we are projecting production levels between 215,000 to 255,000 units. We have seen an increase in orders over the last several months, which could point to the upper end of the range. At the same time, some of this recent activity could prove to be transitory given the changing conditions associated with the virus. As we look at our other markets, we anticipate Europe will be in the range of 300,000 to 350,000 units. In addition to the new restrictions currently being imposed in certain European countries, we are also closely monitoring Brexit as we move throughout 2021. For India, we are projecting the market will increase at the midpoint by approximately 80% year-over-year from historically low volumes in 2020. India was not only severely impacted by the pandemic last year, but also from the transition to the BS-VI emission standard. In the South American market, we expect production in a range of 90,000 to 100,000 units, reflecting relatively stable levels as compared to last year. Let's turn to Slide 11 for our fiscal 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are forecasting sales to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.35 billion. Our revenue guidance does include approximately $75 million in lower aftermarket revenue from the termination of our distribution arrangement with WABCO. However, this is expected to be more than offset by over $100 million of new business wins that we will expect to be in the P&L this year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 9.2% to 10.2%. We anticipate converting a greater than 20% on increased volumes and new business wins due to continued performance and net cost reductions we executed in 2020, which will more than offset higher expected incentive compensation this year. We expect to convert at these levels even while we continue to invest in electrification, which we anticipate at $25 million to $30 million, which is higher than what we spent in 2020. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is in the range of $1.10 to $1.75. Keep in mind, our expected adjusted earnings per share is negatively impacted by about $0.15 over 2020 due to higher expected interest expense as a result of the liquidity actions we executed in June. And finally, we expect to generate $60 million to $100 million of free cash flow, resulting in a conversion rate of 75%, consistent with our M2022 target. Next, I will provide you an update on our progress towards our M2022 targets beginning with new business wins on Slide 12. Our current expectation for fiscal year 2022 is we will exceed our target of $300 million of new business wins by more than $150 million. Several key developments are driving this outperformance. Our acquisition of AxleTech, which provides diversification from our linehaul markets is expected to provide between $175 million to $200 million of revenue in 2022. Additionally, we have been able to win new business in both our commercial truck and aftermarket industrial segments. We are winning new business in every market we serve and across our product portfolio, including in air disc brakes, drivelines and specialty axles for off-highway and defense. And as we go into production with our 14Xe electric powertrain in 2021, we expect revenue will continue to expand in this growing business for us. Now let's turn to the remaining financial targets on the next page. We are confident in our path for achieving a 12.5% adjusted EBITDA margin by converting on incremental revenue from global markets and new business wins at greater than 20%. We expect to deliver strong operational performance from reduced material costs, structural cost savings, footprint optimization and further investments to drive automation and efficiency. We also are on track to meet our free cash flow conversion target of 75%, driven by disciplined and focused working capital management. Our cumulative free cash flow generation for the M2022 3-year plan is coming in lower, however, than our original assumptions due to the pandemic. As a result, this is impacting the amount of future share repurchase activity and our ability to deliver the $4 EPS target. However, we still expect to achieve earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.60, even with these headwinds. Overall, we are on track to achieve or exceed 3 out of the 4 of our M2022 financial targets. Now I will turn the call back over to Jay for some closing remarks. Jay Craig : Thanks, Carl. Now let's turn to Slide 14. As you heard today, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and exceptional execution. We earned new business, manage costs aggressively and extended relationships with important customers. And we are now preparing to begin the next step in our transition from prototype to production of the next-generation powertrain. We look forward to our continued journey in fiscal 2021. Now we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital. James Picariello : Jay, congrats on the decision. And Chris, of course, congrats to you as well. Jay Craig : Thanks a lot, Jim. James Picariello : Just on the key bridge items to FY '21 EBITDA, what are the incremental permanent savings you expect to achieve this upcoming year? And to what extent does the unwind of this past year's temporary cost actions present a headwind or an offset? Carl Anderson : Yes. James, it's Carl. On the run rate savings we expect to achieve from the reductions we executed last year, it's about $30 million. And if you look at the impact that we had in 2020, we had about $20 million to $23 million associated with just kind of the temporary salary reductions. And we also had a benefit from some of the headcount actions that we took in the last quarter of the year. So run rate, $30 million as we go forward. In addition, this year, we also have some other more temporary discretion cost reductions that we are planning for as well, which is about $10 million. James Picariello : Okay. And that last part, is that tied to the aftermarket industrial restructuring that you announced this morning? Or is that something separate? Carl Anderson : No, that would be separate. So -- and then if you think about that as far as, as Jay alluded to, we do expect to have run rate savings, which really will begin in 2022. But for this year, in '21, it's a little bit of a headwind because we do have some expense that we will incur as a result of those actions. James Picariello : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And on the new business wins, encouraging to see the raised target, right, to greater than $450 million versus the original $300 million. I know AxleTech probably takes care of most of that original $300 million. And did I hear correctly you expect to realize $100 million in new business wins this year in FY '21 as incremental to the P&L? Carl Anderson : That is correct on the last point, yes. James Picariello : Okay. So the pipeline, the EV pipeline, I think last quarter, the pipeline was maybe $500 million and you had in backlog bookings $200 million. Are those the right numbers? And have they changed at all? Carl Anderson : I think that's still directionally the right numbers as you think about what we have for electrification at this point. Jay Craig : And I think, James, we're estimating for 2022, we should have approximately $100 million of incremental revenue for electrification. James Picariello : Right. Okay. So maybe the $200 million is more like $300 million? Or we could... Jay Craig : No, of that pipeline, what will be realized in 2022 will be about $100 million. James Picariello : Understood. Understood. Got it. Last one for me. The fact that receivable I think you might have $75 million left to recover, correct me if I'm wrong. And just from an industry volume standpoint in Europe, what would be needed to fully recover that amount? I mean is it a 450,000 unit number? How should we think about that? Carl Anderson : It's a good question. I think in order to pull a recovery, it would be probably closer to the 400,000 type of production range. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. Congratulations again. Carl, I want to first talk about the air disc brake business. What part of the commercial truck business is breaks? Is that relevant going forward for electric trucks, what are the puts and takes with regen brakes? And are you active to regen index? And then kind of finally, now that WABCO is integrated into ZF, does that change the competitive landscape at all? Chris Villavarayan : Brian, this is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So in terms of our portfolio, somewhere about 1/3 to 40% of our business is our brake business. And it is integral. And if you think about it, obviously, even with electrification, air disc brakes are needed, and so it is an integral portion of our business. So the win is very significant as we see it. Going forward, you will always need disc brakes even with regen braking, you do need a secondary form of protection, and that's what the disc brakes provide. Brian Johnson : Okay. And in terms of the competitive landscape, does it change at all with WABCO? Because I remember in the distant past, I think you had the Roadranger JV together. Just maybe update us on how that changes anything in terms of your competitive position in brakes? Chris Villavarayan : No, it doesn't change any of the competitive position. And in terms of this specific win, it's specific to the North American market. And so we don't see that as having any impact. Brian Johnson : Okay. And in terms of the new revenue target, it's a bit higher than in M22, okay AxleTech comes in, but also, I think your original targeted same 250,000 Class 8 market. So where should we think about starting -- should we start at $4.1 billion and work our way up and down based on end markets? Or are there other kind of revenue puts and takes we should be thinking about? Carl Anderson : Yes. Brian, it's a good question. Yes, I think relative to what we originally laid out in our Analyst Day back in 2018, we had about $3.95 billion of revenue. We are coming out ahead on the new business wins, as we outlined. But relative to that, we do have some FX headwinds associated with that about $100 million, and we also have some lower market assumptions, if you think, especially in India as well as in China. So I think the revenue line item, all in is still around what we originally planned for, which is around that $3.9 billion, $3.95 billion range. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then final question, great slide on Daimler. But just light vehicles were all obsessed with the potential for OEMs to in-source e-driveline activities. Can you just recap -- Daimler is one of the more integrated Class 8 players on the -- with Detroit diesel, for example. Do you expect this to be a very long-term contract? Or do you expect to somehow transition this technology to more of a component supply and have them manufacture it? Chris Villavarayan : So Brian, let me take that question again. It's Chris Villavarayan. I think when you think about it, we've had a very long relationship with Daimler. And if you think through the strategy that both companies have had over the past 10 years, that strategy has existed and we've worked well through that. And through the market cycles up and down, we've managed to maintain or even with that growth share. And so I don't see this dynamic changing. If anything, I think this agreement brings us both together and closer. And so we do see it as a great win capping on what Jay talked about with respect to how we have done on the quality and the delivery standpoint over the last 2 years. And we can build off that through 2027. Brian Johnson : Okay. And congratulations again. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital. Joseph Spak : I'll extend my congrats again as well. Carl, maybe just a first question, and thanks for all the color. I'm trying to sort of follow along at home here. It seems like with all the different puts and takes you mentioned in terms of incremental restructuring and costs coming back and the step-up in electrification investment that underlying incrementals on just the volume portion is still in that 15% to 20%. Is that roughly correct? Carl Anderson : I think, Joe, it's probably closer to the upper end of that range, but that is directionally correct. And then obviously, from that point, if you layer in the cost savings that are now more permanent,as well as the footprint optimization, that's what drives the incremental conversions north of 20% as we go forward. Joseph Spak : Okay. On the '21 guide, just on the industry outlook, I think you're below some recent third-party forecasts that were just revised higher. Is that just some typical Meritor management prudence or is there something you're seeing... Jay Craig : No. I think, Joe, those estimates by the industry analytic firms have been extremely volatile. You've seen people changing them almost on a weekly basis. And as you would expect, that wide range of guidance is how we're running the company internally, and we want to be prepared, as Carl said, if there's uptick in the pandemic and unfortunately, required shutdowns, particularly in Europe or North America, we could see those volumes come down from the higher end in towards the midpoint of the lower end. And we want to make sure the company is prepared to operate successfully at that light end to that range. As I told our Board last week, this is probably the most uncertain time in terms of market estimates I've ever seen in my tenure with the company. So we're just trying to make sure we keep all the optionality open for running the company. Joseph Spak : Okay. On the new business target, $150 million higher. Can you tell us how much of that incremental $150 million has already been achieved? And how much more is to go? How much of that $150 million is electrification? And also, does it include the additional ePowertrain awards you indicated you expect on Slide 6? Carl Anderson : Yes. I think, Joe, as we signaled on the -- just in my prepared remarks, if you think about '21, we are anticipating to have a little bit north of $100 million of new wins coming into P&L that wasn't in last year. If I kind of look at where we ended up last year, we ended up just on total net basis, a little bit less than $100 million. So it really kind of implies we have north of $200 million that will come into '22 in order for us to achieve those targets that we laid out. This is all inclusive of even -- at least to date, some of the electrification awards, obviously, if we're successful in the near future with adding some others that will be incremental. Joseph Spak : And then one last... Chris Villavarayan : And a good way to think about that last part, Joe, is that the electrification portion, as Jay pointed out, would be about $100 million in 2022. Joseph Spak : Okay. Last one for me, just on the '22 margin bridge. You still say, a portion of that's from normalized global markets. And Jay, I appreciate your comment that it seems more uncertain than ever. But it seems like at least North America, even what you're talking for '21 is pretty close to $250 million, which I think is really normalized. So is it fair to say that, that margin bridge unless North America goes in excess of normalized is really dependent on international markets? Carl Anderson : I think it's -- Joe, yes, I mean, if you look at what we're expecting, we are looking for increases in Brazil, India. We also are planning for the additional new business wins as well as what we're -- in Europe as well. So it is really outside of North America that we expect to really generate the incremental revenue in '22. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Just relative to the $6 million headwind to commercial truck EBITDA in 3Q from electrification initiatives, are you able to quantify the extent to which those costs -- what costs either on an absolute level or a year-over-year basis are maybe factored into the '21 guide? And then just taking a step back from that, too. I recall you in the past saying that ultimately, you expect electrification to be accretive to margin, including I imagine because you're providing more value-add technology, et cetera. Should we think about the incrementals for electrification associated revenue tracking above the sort of more normal-ish 20% conversion? And then as you get those higher incrementals and they compare to the investments, at what point in time and what year do you think is it 2022, et cetera, after the ePowertrain launches, et cetera, that ultimately, the electrification business does become accretive to the overall all-in margin? Carl Anderson : Ryan, thanks for the questions. As it relates to just on the cost actions, if you think about it, it's probably best to think about it on a year-over-year basis. We did have about $30 million of cost actions that affected and came into the P&L in fiscal '20. I would say 2/3 of that was really along temporary cost actions and salary reductions, with 1/3 of that being more permanent in the actions we executed back in the late third quarter for us. As a result, if you kind of flip into '21, on a run rate basis, we do expect about $30 million of cost savings from all of those headcount reduction actions we executed. In addition, we are also planning for about $10 million of, I would say, other cost items as well for next year. And then on your electrification question, I think we're still kind of in the ramp-up mode. As Jay articulated, we are beginning production this in '21, a little bit later in a couple of months. And then obviously, we're going to be ramping up through '22 and then beyond. So I think our expectation is this will be accretive at some point, but I would say, over the next couple of years, we're still going to be kind of in ramp-up mode and will be a little bit of a headwind for us. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just relative to capital allocation, I think I heard you say, is that right that you'd be starting to repay debt in the back half of next year? And also just comments on capital expenditure outlook? Is it a little bit less than in recent years? And how should we think about that trending in light of electrification investments impacting EBITDA, too? And then how do you weigh the debt paydown versus you've been buying back shares in recent years in terms of priority, et cetera? Carl Anderson : Yes. As it relates to capital allocation, we are committed to ensure we maintain our strong BB credit metrics. And as you think about -- as we think about the current leverage, it's obviously inflated this year just due to the absolute drop in EBITDA dollars. As that kind of comes back, we anticipate to grow back into the balance sheet and be able to have those type of BB credit metrics as we go forward. We are planning, though, in the second half of the year to repay some debt in order to ensure we accelerate that path. And then as we kind of get into '22, we will be looking at again as far as allocating capital to share buybacks. We'll be assessing that at that point. And then on your capital expenditures questions, it's about $85 million, very similar to what we did last year. That's something that as the year goes on, we'll continue to take a look at. But we tend to, as you know, have CapEx as a percent of revenue, somewhere between the 2.7% to 3% range, and we're very comfortable in that. Operator : Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Jay, Chris, congrats to you both. Carl, just to follow-on the prior question, just to clarify, with the fiscal '22 free cash conversion outlook today, does that still translate just to over the original kind of $200 million plus you guided to originally in 2018? Carl Anderson : It's pretty close to that, Itay. When you do the quick math on that, I think it points to about $190 million, but yes, it's right around that range. Itay Michaeli : Great. And then as we think about just the new business progress and kind of how we think about maybe margins beyond markets normalizing. What's a good way to think about incremental margins, specifically on new business going forward? Jay Craig : I think it depends, Itay, on which segment it comes through. Certainly, as we see new business coming in through the AxleTech acquisition or in our specialty and off-highway, that would be at the higher end of the margin profile relative to that segment that it resides in with aftermarket. As far as the other truck revenue, new business, we're always striving to have the incremental new business to be at or above what the current business is. And I think you've seen over the last 6 years or so that, that track record has been pretty strong. So it really depends on the mix of that business. And we do have quite a few wins that are in the specialty and off-highway areas. So we could see that segment get a disproportionate share of the new business wins. Itay Michaeli : That's very helpful. And maybe just lastly, back to the balance sheet, and I apologize if I missed this. Carl, as you kind of -- I think you mentioned earlier, maybe it was Jay that you want to run with a little bit higher cash balances now just given the crisis. Any thoughts that we could think about in terms of how the company wants to run with minimum liquidity or even a leverage target in the next sort of 12 to 18 months? Jay Craig : I think I'll start off and ask Carl to fill in. Carl did just mention it on a previous question. But remember, our first priority in capital allocation is to maintain our strong BB credit metrics. We believe that has served us and investors extremely well over the last 6 to 9 months as we've been through this crisis. And it has validated our belief that, that's a critical benchmark for us to maintain. So that will be the first and foremost goal in the capital allocation and then as you've seen historically with us, we do not let cash sit idly on our balance sheet, but we'll deploy any excess cash beyond that in shareholder-friendly ways. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks. Todd Chirillo : Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3. As you can see from our results this quarter, we're off to a tremendous start for the year. I want to thank Meritor employees for the excellent performance. Regardless of the environment, this team exceeds expectations, as demonstrated last year, and right out of the gate, in fiscal 2021. Our Class 8 truck orders from North America, our largest market, rose to the fourth and fifth highest months in history, in November and December. We executed it exceedingly well, as you will hear from Chris and Carl. In fact, with truck volumes materially rising in almost all our end markets, we are raising our full year outlook significantly. Since 2021 rebound provides us with increased confidence and a clear path to 2022 objectives, particularly because we believe that some of this year's headwinds, will become tailwinds next year, as we complete our current M-plans. At the same time, we're investing in the revolutionary technologies we are bringing to market. These technologies will give commercial vehicle OEMS, optimal solutions to meet regional CO2 reduction targets, and will also provide a host of other benefits.  At this point, I will turn the call over to Chris, for highlights for the quarter, and come back later for closing comments. Chris Villavarayan : Thanks, Jake. We're obviously pleased with our results this quarter. On revenue that was essentially flat year-over -year, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 60 basis points higher than the same period last year, and free cash flow was up significantly. Carl will give you more details on the financials in just a moment, but the primary takeaway is that we're optimistic about the demand for commercial vehicles throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021.  We expect significantly higher volumes than most markets, as most economies deploy fiscal and monetary stimuli, the vaccine rollout gains momentum, and the demand for goods increases, particularly in North America. On the right half of this slide, we highlight business wins this quarter. You will remember that last November, we said we expected to exceed our M2022 new business target of 300 million. We're going to talk about some of those contracts that are driving that outperformance in our truck and industrial businesses, as well as production awards for our electric powertrain.  Moving to Slide 4, you will see a few examples of customers with whom we have recently secured new business on a variety of applications. In India, we have additional axle contracts with Ashok Leyland and Daimler India, for medium and heavy duty vehicle. We now have standard position with Terex for front and rear drive axles and brakes on concrete mixers. We will supply an existing customer with independent front suspensions for recreational vehicles, and we have entered a new three-year LTA with John Deere for 100% of its applicator axles. Transitioning to electrification, Slide 5 gives you a look at additional contracts we\u2019ve secured for our ePowertrain. As mentioned last quarter, we believe we'll be the first supplier to manufacture electric ePowertrains for Class 8 trucks. These new contracts reflect the application flexibility we\u2019ve designed into our electric powertrain portfolio, and the growing demand for Meritor\u2019s solution. The ePowertrain is an integrated product, engineered to allow for a variety of subsystems, including axle, transmission, motors, wheel ends, and brakes, to function as one efficient system. We have entered into a five-year agreement to supply Meritor\u2019s 14Xe electric powertrains for Autocar\u2019s refuse vehicle. With Lion Electric, a Canadian manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, we signed a three-year agreement to supply our heavy duty tandem electric powertrain for Lion\u2019s AT tractor. And we\u2019ve also secured a three-year contract with Volta Trucks in London. Meritor\u2019s 14Xe will be equipped on the Volta Zero, a full land 16-tonne commercial vehicle designed for inner city parcel and freight distribution. We expect revenues from all these contracts to ramp up in 2023. With the industry recognition we have already received for this product, the growing number of production contracts, we are highly confident that Meritor\u2019s electric powertrain represents game-changing technology for commercial vehicles.  Carl will now provide more detail on our financial results. Carl Anderson : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our first quarter financial results, discuss the upturn we are seeing in most of our global markets, and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Overall, as you heard from Chris, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5%, and we generated $34 million of free cash flow.  Now, let me provide the details of our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Beginning with total company results, revenue came in at $889 million, roughly flat from the same period last year. Net income from continuing operations was $32 million, compared to $39 million in the prior year. Lower net income was primarily the result of higher interest expense, which included $8 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. This was partially offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year.  Additionally, joint venture earnings increased $5 million from a year ago. This was driven primarily from a $6 million one-time gain recognized from our joint venture in Brazil relating to a value added tax credit. Overall, this drove adjusted EBITDA of $102 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, a 50 basis point increase from the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.60, down slightly from $0.64 last year. And free cash flow improved by $69 million from a year ago, as we saw a tailwind from our back stream programs, and we had $32 million in lower incentive compensation payments in the quarter. Now, let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 4% to $691 million. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by slightly higher market bounds in Europe and India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $63 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year.  The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, cost reduction actions executed last year, and higher joint venture earnings. This was partially offset by higher freight premiums, and a $6 million increase in electrification spend, as compared to last year. Aftermarket industrial sales were $234 million in the first quarter, down $41 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As we saw last quarter, even with lower revenue, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 15%. The increase was driven by cost reduction actions executed last year, which more than offset the impact from lower revenue.  I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 7. In the North America Class 8 market, we are now projecting production levels between 270,000 to 290,000 units, a nearly 20% increase at the midpoint from our prior outlook. We have seen a full quarter of strong order intakes, including two months of orders greater than 50,000 units. And just last night, January preliminary orders came in at over 42,000 units. This aligns with the strong production forecast we are seeing from our customers, all pointing to a significant production recovery in 2021. Turning to Europe, we're also seeing a steady increase in this market. We now forecast production will be in the range of 360,000 to 380,000 units. South America is another market where we are experiencing a strong rebound. We are now forecasting production to be in the range of 135,000 to 145,000 units, almost a 50% increase at the mid-point from our prior outlook. At these levels, it would be the strongest Class 8 production year since 2014. And in India, we are maintaining our previous forecast of 230,000 to 250,000 units. Keep in mind, this still represents an increase of approximately 80% year-over -year from historically low volumes in 2020. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are now forecasting sales to be in the range of 3.65 billion to 3.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.8%, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance. With the upturn, we are encountering several headwinds which will impact earnings conversions as we move through 2021. Increasing demand across the global economy is driving significant increases in steel, our largest material cost.  While we have cost recovery mechanisms in place with most of our OE customers, they generally are on a three to six month lag. As a result, we are currently seeing $15 million to $20 million in higher steel costs in fiscal 2021, due to the timing impact of these cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, at the significantly higher market levels, we are anticipating higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $15 million. With these headwinds, we now anticipate earnings conversion of approximately 19% on incremental revenue, compared to last year. Overall, if you were to adjust for these two items, our conversion on the incremental revenue would be around 22 to 23%, more in line with our expectations. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now the range of $2.25 and $2.50. And finally, we expect to generate $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow.  On Slide 9, I want to provide an update to our path for achieving the company's M2022 margin target of 12.5%. As we have seen in prior M-plans, the steps for achieving our targets may change, but we typically are able to adjust to the current operating environment and deliver on our targets. The 12.5% margin target is no exception. As we discussed on the previous slide, we are seeing increased costs related to both steel and incentive compensation in 2021. Next year, we do expect these costs to normalize, providing a 60 to 80 basis point tailwind. We also anticipate converting on incremental volume and new business wins at greater than 20%.  Additionally, as we announced last quarter, we are in the process of executing a footprint optimization plan, which will result in the consolidation of four locations into existing facilities. This will provide an additional tailwind of $12 million to $15 million, as $5 million of cost to execute the consolidation in 2021, will be behind us, and approximately $7 million to $10 million of savings from the smaller footprint, will be realized. The conversion on increased revenue and the footprint optimization, are expected to provide an additional 90 to 130 basis points of incremental margin next year. Overall, the path to achieving our 12.5% margin target remains clear.  Before I turn the call back over to Jay, I want to take a moment to express my deepest appreciation for his extraordinary leadership he's shown through his many years at Meritor. On both a personal and professional level, I wish Jay all the best, and look forward to working with him in his new role. Now, I will turn the call over to Jay for final remarks. Jay Craig : Thanks, Carl. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10. With this being my last call with you, I wanted to make a few comments before we go to questions. My first earnings call with Meritor was in the second quarter of 2008, and except for a few quarters in 2013, and \u201814, when I was running the business, I have not missed one. So, I guess that puts me somewhere close to 50 calls. While in charge and all CEOs and CFOs look forward to them, I can honestly say, I always did. Our investors and analysts, many of whom have been with us a long time, always drove us to be better, and challenged us to look at the business from different perspectives. Your insight, comments, and questions, contributed to the successful transformation of the company over the past several years. As I transition to the role of Executive Chairman, I have full confidence in Chris's ability and that of his leadership team, to maintain the trajectory of high performance that we have demonstrated for quite a long time now. Growing our base business, expanding our electrification capabilities, and maintaining excellent levels of operating performance, will continue to be the highest priority, as we remain focused on returning value to shareholders. As we near the successful completion of our third M-plan, we recognize the discipline and execution that it took to become the company we are today, and we'll proceed with the same diligence. For this, I want to thank all our employees around the globe that have helped us achieve the enormous stretch targets we have set for ourselves. I will miss working day to day with such a diverse, talented and driven team.  I also want to thank our Board of Directors for their support and guidance. We have a strong board with a diverse set of strengths, that has played an important role in the company's journey. I look forward to continuing to work with them as Executive Chairman. I wish all of you my best in the future. And with that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from the line of James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James Picariello : Hey, good morning guys. And Jay, congratulations again on your retirement. It's been a pleasure. Within your FY\u201921 guidance here, can you just talk about what the implied incrementals are, what the additional EV related spend might be? And then, Carl, you did mention color on incrementals to FY\u201922. I mean, can you just talk about those incrementals, how we get to that targeted 12.5% for FY\u201922 within that framework? Thanks. Carl Anderson : Good morning, James. Yes, as it relates to fiscal \u201921, as I referenced, we do expect all in, to have about 19% conversion on the incremental revenue that we're seeing. We are faced with a couple of headwinds, and I referenced both steel and incentive compensation, but with - and as it relates to electrification. In the quarter, we did at $6 million of higher electrification spend compared to a year ago. We are also probably tracking closer to the $30 million of electrification expense within fiscal year \u201821 as well. So overall, as we look forward, we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver and get close to that 20% kind of incremental margins for fiscal 21, but more importantly, it really is - as I laid out, we're definitely on track to deliver on our \u201822 target. James Picariello : Got it. The 30 million electrification spend, that's cumulative, right? That would be like an incremental $10 million or so, is that right? Carl Anderson : Yes. It's about 7 million to 8 million higher than we did a year ago. James Picariello : Got it. And then can you just - I mean, maybe I just missed this, but can you provide an update on what the number is in terms of EV awards that are booked, and then what the - is the pipeline potential, that 200 million, has that changed at all? And just maybe talk about what the latest two - the last two awards, what is a highly competitive process. Thanks. Chris Villavarayan : James, it's Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So what we talked about is a line of sight for $500 million, of which, with the announcements we've made today with booked business to $400 million. And we still have our line of sight for the last $100 million to the targets that we had provided earlier. And then talking about the three agreements that we announced today with Lion Electric Volta, and Autocar, that accounts for a total of $200 million of booked up business in total. We're not breaking that out by year. James Picariello : Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me? Jay Craig : Yes, we can. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Thanks. Given the mention on Slide 4 of exposure to the RV market via front suspensions and the record wholesale shipment numbers that have been coming out of the recreational vehicle industry association lately, I just wanted to ask about what your revenue exposure is to this area, what kind of growth you might be seeing. Are you primarily benefiting from the increase in industry volumes, or are you also in any way incrementally targeting that market with new products, et cetera? And also since you last reported earnings, I think we heard the very first announcements relative to the potential for electrification in the RV space, which came from Lordstown Motors and Camping World in December. Do you have any thoughts on electrification in this corner of the market and what role that Meritor could potentially play? Chris Villavarayan : Sure. Ryan, it\u2019s Chris Villavarayan. I'll start the question and then maybe hand it over to Carl to just provide some of the financials. But very quickly, with the acquisition of AxleTech, obviously this has been a very important market. And so, as part of M2022, we also had a strategy to grow in this market. And so, what we're doing is exactly executing on that strategy. The new win is part of a growth strategy and is not associated with the current market growth. So we had a plan to grow this business, and that's exactly what we're doing.  Specific to electrification, we are looking at, let's call it independent suspensions with Wieland Motors, but that is something that we're exploring a little bit further. With that, I'm going to turn it to Carl. Carl Anderson : Ryan, that business kind of resides in our industrial segment. And if I look at what we're seeing in that, especially entering into \u201821 in total, we do now see our industrial business up on a high single digit percent on a year-over-year basis at this point. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Very good. Thank you. And then just last question, relative to the electrification opportunities that were identified on Slide 5, I'm curious if the potential pipeline has maybe grown. And I'd be interested too, if you have any thoughts on GM's new BrightDrop plans, and whether that automaker\u2019s relatively greater vertical integration of electrified drive line components in the light vehicle side, might or might not translate into similar vertical integration on the commercial vehicle side. Also, just what you're seeing generally in terms of the latest developments with regard to commercial vehicle manufacturers\u2019 plans to either insource or outsource the types of electrification components that you're able to provide. Chris Villavarayan : Well, I'll take that question, Ryan. Just maybe first perspective, from a broad spectrum, when we look at the three customer awards that we presented today, Autocar, a nameplate that's been around for 125 - 123 years. And then if you look at Volta, it's a brand new entrant, and Lion\u2019s been in the market for about 10 years. So it's great to see that from a broad spectrum of customers, they see the value in Meritor\u2019s product. Now, specific to where we see this growth, we do see - the first thing that we're focused on is obviously completing our pipeline. And to that point, we\u2019re testing with a multitude of OEs right now around the globe. So hopefully we can talk about more wins here, but right now, we're targeting - targeted on closing out on our $500 million book of business that we talk about. Specific to the GM, and let's call it the skateboard, I think when you look at - the best part about it is, in terms of whether you look at OEs integrating this, the best part of electrification is in any sense, I think what it does is, it drives competition, and it will speed us faster towards sustainable energy. And in any sense, as we look at the real estate we have, it just means more content for us, no matter what happens. And in that sense, our perspective is that as long as we're in this space, this will continue to grow for us. Jay Craig : Yes. And I\u2019d say, Ryan - this is Jay. One last comment. There\u2019s always been a significant difference between the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle OEs and the level of vertical integration of components. So we've obviously had a significant share of the drive train market across the EV industry, and we expect that to continue into the future, based on the discussions that we're having so far moving to electrification. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joseph Spak : Thank you very much, and wanted to echo my congratulations to Jay again, and then obviously the rest of the team. Back on electrification, a couple of questions here. You mentioned a bunch of these startups. There\u2019s obviously a lot more we've seen trying to come to market than on this page. Like how - can you just talk to us a little bit about how you approach the opportunity? Because obviously, they\u2019re sort of all incremental, but it does require you guys to commit resources and capital and the exact path of some of these ventures is maybe a little bit unclear. So how do you think - you almost have to be a little bit of a VC in that respect, right? So how do you think about sort of approaching the opportunity with some of these startups? Chris Villavarayan : So, Joe, I'll take that question. And I think the perspective that we use, if we look at the Class 8, let's call it the medium and the heavy duty Class 8 market, and we look at, what is the percentage of electrification, and we aim for that, or a percentage - a fair share of that. And in essence, work with every OE that is approaching that space and provide our product. But in overall in how we capacitize, we're looking at what we believe will be the model of what roles will be there in electrification as a percentage of the overall market. Joseph Spak : Okay. So it's not necessarily - you don't necessarily view it as sort of like a bet on any one of these individual companies, because the product is somewhat fungible between them? Chris Villavarayan : Yes. I think, Joe, to that point, I think it\u2019s - for us, it\u2019s more about the product as far as all the development, all of the testing that we have done and kind of how that stands. And I do think, as we think about how that fits in with whether a couple of the startups with existing customers and obviously the large OE customers we have today, that is kind of the focus. And we do believe our product is a differentiator, and that will - is really kind of the path to market for us across all of these potential opportunities. Joseph Spak : Okay. So, maybe then just to follow up, or two quick follow ups on that. Like, one, can you talk about the range of activities on electrification, like from - like either whole e-axles or components and how that might vary with different potential customers? And I guess also, we touched a little bit on the EV spend, but it seems like that might need to continue to sort of move higher, especially if the new wins continue to move higher. So, wanted to get some thoughts on that and when you might sort of get to a breakeven, or sort of self-funding level on the investment, Jay Craig : Well, let me start off. And just following on Carl's comments, if you look at the three announcements today, they're all based off the 14Xe powertrain. So it's the perfect example of using the same product and making - as you called it, fungible across the three OEs. So that's one perspective that we're using. On top of that, when we - the announcement we made with PACCAR, the last one for a full EV kit, that includes the PCARs, the battery system, as well as the electric powertrain, or the 14Xe tandem. With that, I'll turn it over to Carl. Carl Anderson : Yes, Joe, as we look at it, we're not chasing all the various startups. We\u2019re really just focused on what's fitting our product portfolio. So that's kind of one of the first lens that we look through. And as Chris just discussed, we are - we both have the kit side, as well as the 14Xe and the axle side, and 17Xe in the future. And as we look forward, our expectation is, when it kind of flips to profitability, it\u2019s probably outside the \u201822 time horizon, but as we see it now, that that can come potentially as early as in 2023, depending on what we're seeing in the market at that time. Joseph Spak : Okay. Maybe I could just sneak one more. I thought I heard you mentioned some additional optimization and restructuring. I\u2019m just curious if you could provide a little bit more details on that because, right, the team - you guys mentioned sort of early on, it seems like the markets are moving in your favor, sort of going more up than down. So I just wanted to better understand that. Chris Villavarayan : Yes. So nothing was new. This was just - we didn't talk about this last quarter as well. So we just helped to try to frame what the impact we will see in \u201822 as a result from these optimization plans. So in total, we are expecting, as you kind of compare \u201822 to \u201821, it's probably somewhere about $13 million to $15 million of tailwind, if we think about EBITDA as we enter \u201922, once we're fully are - complete these facility closures. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And our next question does come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Johnson : Good morning, and want to echo congratulations to Jay, who I'm sure will still be helpful on the strategic direction. I think I've been at probably 95% of those calls since then. So in terms of the 14Xe and these interesting wins, just when I thought I knew every electric bus and truck company out there, you find another one. But the question is, can you just remind - a few things. One, just remind us of the content opportunity, obviously not your price list. But if you think about an electric urban truck like Volta is talking about, with the 14Xe axle versus if you did one for one of your traditional OEMs, the type of content you might have. Jay Craig : Sure. Brian, I'll take that. And first of all, Brian, it's about five times in terms of content of our traditional vehicle platform. Brian Johnson : And then, we\u2019re certainly well aware of Dana, the competitor sort of in that space, then they focus more on medium duty. A question we get though is, given Cummins, EDEN, Allison, are also very important Class 5 to 7 and Class 8 suppliers, how do your - what do you see from those powertrain buyers coming over into the electric truck and bus marketplace? Jay Craig : Well, I think, the one thing is, as I look at it, and as I mentioned that competition and obviously is something that will make us all better and drive towards electrification and drive the products to be better across the whole spectrum. But specific to our products, I think the one great thing is, we're going to be first to production here in the summer of this year. We have over 100 vehicles on path.  And in that sense, if you look at our product, I think the best part about it is the fact that it's fully integrated. You have a motor integrated with an axle, integrated with the wheel end, and that\u2019s - the sense of what we're putting together, that's only about 100 to 150 pounds heavier than a standard axle. So if you put that in perspective, you're removing an engine and a transmission and shrink - then shrinking it into that space. Brian Johnson : Right. And given the high margins we've seen in the transmission space, one way to think about is you're basically taking both engine and transmission content and margin, and bringing it over to Meritor. Is that a fair generalization? Chris Villavarayan : Well, that\u2019s - as you said, maybe the best way to answer that, Brian, is we \u2026 Carl Anderson : Yes, I think, Brian, I would say, over the last six years, we've seen that margin move up, not only cost reductions, but from all the new products we've introduced, taken out the traditional side. And I would say, our expectations for the electric products are no different. We\u2019ll be introducing products we think have more concepts and higher margin. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then kind of a follow on question, which is kind of, as you look at these specs and the new entrants, most of them are kind of pre-revenue. How do you - I know you sort of answered this question earlier, how do you get comfortable that it's actually worth your time? And I guess the second one is, with some of the larger fleet and larger Class 8 manufacturers, how would you - if someone doesn't go with a startup truck operator, but wants to go with a player provider, how are you positioned there? Jay Craig : Well, again, I think we're focused on the product, and let's call it the weight class. So when we come in, we're looking at it as, what does the 14Xe powertrain cover? And we think about it as the Class 8 line hall space, or just down to a medium duty, the top end of a Class 7 space. And we're taking a product and positioning it where it can go across, whether it's to a new entrant, or to a company that's been well entrenched and a customer of Meritor for many, many years. So - and there's perfect examples of both ends of that spectrum, even in our announcements in the last two quarters, whether it's Autocar and PACCAR on one side, or Lion and Volta on the other side. Brian Johnson : Okay. And final question. You didn't have your trademark analyst day at a hotel this year. But we are both coming up on the successor to Meritor \u201822, as well as starts to kind of kicking the tires again, so to speak, or the axles, on some of your products - e-products, is going to be interesting. Do you have any thoughts about an event later in the year that would bring those two important things together? Chris Villavarayan : We do, Brian. And I think, just as you have experienced with Jay, we've in essence, always done - started preparing for the release of it a year in advance. And so, we're in the process of developing our M2025 strategy. And ideally, we'd like to have it with all of you in-person, probably at the end of the year or worst case, let's call it at the beginning of next year. But that's our goal right now, is to drive for the end of this year. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Look forward to that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two follow-up financial questions, first on the M2022 revenue target that you expect to exceed. Hoping you can just update us, remind us of the latest end market assumptions, particularly relative to the original end market assumptions behind the $4 billion of revenue target. And then secondly, just on free cash flow conversion, I think last quarter, you were still talking about 75%. Just curious if there's any change to next year's free cash conversion outlook. Carl Anderson : Okay. Good morning, Itay. As it relates to - maybe I\u2019ll answer the free cash flow first, yes, no change in our planning assumptions for \u201922. We still expect to drive and achieve the 75% free cash flow conversion. I think in the short term, in \u201821, I think every cash flow is cutting a high 50% - just about 70% as we are expanding a little bit of our CapEx spend this year by about $10 million, which is one of the drivers to that. As relating to the end market assumptions, we're not updating them today, but what we did say back in November, we were still planning for replacement demand market levels in North America and Europe, primarily in 2022. And it's something that, just based off the strength of the market that we're seeing here in \u201921, we will be taking a closer look at that once again as we kind of get later out this year and provide a further update as we kind of get into \u201822. Itay Michaeli : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Gents, good morning, and congratulations. Maybe want to wax a little bit more philosophical here for a second. I think a lot of investors have been drawing comparisons this freight cycle with the last great cycle, which is maybe natural, except that the wavelength this time around has obviously been very compressed. And I'm wondering, as you talk to your customers on the commercial vehicle side, especially what your perception is in terms of where we are in the cycle inning-wise. And then maybe just a little bit more broadly, with the continued growth in the EV opportunity, how do you think about cyclicality in your business going forward? Chris Villavarayan : Sure. Let me - Bruce, I'll take that question. So when - in terms of the market, obviously going back probably fall of last year, not too many of us could have predicted this return. However, as we looked at the last November, December, 40s and supplies, truck order intakes, and then with January at 42,000, in essence what we're seeing from our customers is, all of them are cautiously raising line rates up, primarily focused on three things. One is COVID. The second one is looking at the impact of the supply chains. And then the final one is also being mindful of finding folks to be able to staff up the shifts.  So - but with that, what we're seeing right now is, the backend or the mid to backend of this is, line rates are starting to come back up with most of our customers. So that's one perspective. And specific to electrification, I think it's a very fair question. I think when you think about electrification, the cyclicality should come out because of - you think about a growth that is much more muted as the growth goes through. I think we'll see far less cyclicality. So I hope that's helpful. Bruce Chan : It is. Great. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chirillo for any further remarks. Todd Chirillo : Thank you for joining Meritor\u2019s first quarter earnings call. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q2 2021 Meritor Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Todd Chirillo, the Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please, go ahead, sir. Todd Chirillo : Thank you, Felicia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. On the call today we have Chris Villavarayan, CEO and President; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor Inc.

We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide two for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Chris Villavarayan : Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to slide three. We had strong results this quarter, with $983 million in sales and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%. Total company sales were up 13% year-over-year, as truck demand increased in all our global markets. Free cash flow performance was excellent this quarter, coming in at $47 million. This was one of our highest second quarter cash flows since we began the implants in 2013. Once again, the Meritor team demonstrated its ability to successfully respond to markets. Even with the sharp increase in volumes and supply chain challenges, we maintain excellent delivery and quality performance for our customers, while converting increased sales to profits at expected levels. Looking at the full fiscal year, we're holding our sales, margin and cash flow guidance, despite indications that we will have one of the largest unfavorable steel impacts we have seen, in addition to higher expense in electric powertrain development, as we ramp up production capabilities to meet the increasing demand. Carl will provide more detail, but our ability to offset these headwinds reflects the consistent strong execution you expect from us. We have a brand-new electrification program to announce this quarter, in addition to an exciting new opportunity to accelerate development of our 17Xe electric powertrain in Europe. And in our core business, we have recently finalized long-term agreements with two global OE customers. Please move to slide four. In the second quarter, we extended our agreement with Navistar through 2026. We are pleased to continue our long-standing relationship with Navistar, as it becomes part of the Traton family. This agreement extends our current relationship, while providing opportunity for future growth in our major product categories of axles, brakes and drivelines. We also completed a new agreement with IVECO in Europe through 2024. This includes the supply of single reduction axles and strengthens our successful business relationship between our companies. It also provides the opportunity for future growth on other product lines. With Navistar and IVECO complete, most of our long-term agreements with major customers have been renewed well past the 2022 time frame. Moving to electrification on slide 5. We are pleased to announce a new collaboration with Hexagon Purus Systems, a global leader in zero emission e-mobility. Hexagon will integrate Meritor's 14Xe powertrain into its Class 6, Class 7 box trucks and Class 8 6x4 vehicles starting 2021. Customers, including PACCAR, AutoCar, line electric Volta trucks and Hexagon have chosen Meritor's 14Xe integrated electric powertrain. We believe this is market validation of its industry-leading performance. In early 2020, we announced an agreement with PACCAR to be the initial launch partner and supplier for the integration of the fully functional battery electric systems on the Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 and 520 electric vehicles. We have begun prototype production and PACCAR is performing validation testing on its test tracks. It's very exciting for us to see these fully electric vehicles being assembled. Soon these and many others with Meritor's preferred electric powertrain solutions will be fully operational on roads and highways. Please take a minute to view a video of this truck in motion on meritor.com. This footage was shot last week, at our Escondido California facility. With market adoption growing for our 14Xe, we're now shifting the focus to the development of the 17Xe platform in Europe. Last month, we learnt we were a grant recipient of the advanced propulsion center in the United Kingdom. This grant will partially fund the development of Meritor 17Xe. After a comprehensive months-long nomination and consideration process, we were thrilled to be selected along with our consortium partners Danfoss Editron and Electra Commercial Vehicles. This grant totaling almost \u00a316 million will rapidly accelerate development of this product, that is designed for multiple vehicle platforms and extend our ability to offer Meritor's e-powertrain solutions for the European market. We believe demand for this product will grow because of the EU 2025 CO2 reduction targets. Stricter targets will start applying in 2030 and by 2040 all new trucks sold in Europe will need to be fossil-free to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The 17Xe is another significant step towards completing our electric powertrain portfolio. Carl, will now provide details on our financial results. Carl Anderson : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. As Chris mentioned at the beginning of the call, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3%, and we generated $47 million of free cash flow. Now, let's review our financial results compared to the prior year on slide 6. Before I continue, I want to highlight a revision we are making to our presentation of two non-GAAP measures, adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share. To better align with SEC guidance, we will no longer include in non-GAAP measures the adjustment for non-cash tax expense related to the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits. It is important to note, this is a change to our reporting metrics only as the underlying availability and benefit of tax attributes to offset future taxable income has not changed. We expect to maintain an effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% through the M2022 planning cycle. In the appendix, we have also updated prior periods to reflect this change providing for consistent comparatives. Now let's review the details of our financial results. Beginning with the total company, revenue came in at $983 million, up $112 million from the same period last year. As economies rebounded globally, we saw increased truck production in all of our markets. Net income from continuing operations was $63 million, compared to $240 million last year. As a reminder, prior year results include $203 million of after-tax income related to the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly owned Brazilian entity of $22 million or $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $111 million, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA this quarter excludes the $22 million Brazil value-added tax credit I previously mentioned. The decrease in margin was primarily driven by an approximately $20 million impact from incentive compensation cost compared to the prior period. Keep in mind, last year we significantly reduced our incentive compensation accrual at the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, we experienced higher freight costs as compared to a year ago. This higher expense was offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year. Overall, we were pleased with our margin performance, especially given some of these cost headwinds. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.04 from last year. And free cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $47 million. Last year we generated $292 million of free cash flow, which included $265 million related to our distribution agreement termination. If you adjust for the one-time impact from last year, free cash flow improved $20 million year-over-year. Based on our market outlook and expectations on cash flow generation going forward, we are in a position to return to a more normalized level of cash on our balance sheet. We therefore are announcing the redemption of the remaining 6.25% notes due in 2024. The $175 million principal balance will be redeemed at the call price of just over 101%, utilizing available cash on hand, which was $321 million at the end of the second quarter. Our objective of maintaining BB credit metrics through market cycles was reinforced this past year, as we were able to successfully manage through the onset of the pandemic. Upon completion of the debt repurchase, our gross debt balances will be similar to where we were pre-COVID. We were also on track for net leverage to be approximately two times this year and plan for a further step down in 2022. Now let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 23%, driven by higher global truck production in all markets. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $73 million, up $15 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.4%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and by cost reductions actions executed last year. This was partially offset by higher incentive compensation and freight costs. Aftermarket and industrial sales were $247 million in the second quarter, down $30 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of our distribution arrangement, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Segment adjusted EBITDA was down $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 13.8%. The decreases were driven primarily by the impact from the termination of our distribution arrangement and increased incentive compensation costs, partially offset by cost reduction actions. Before I review our current global market outlook on slide 7, I want to provide an update on supply chain constraints in the markets we are closely monitoring. Global supply chains, primarily for semiconductors have become constrained during this global production upturn. This has affected many global manufacturing industries including commercial trucks. We are seeing some impact to production schedules as a result.  In India, the current wave of the pandemic is having a significant impact on the country, which could affect the ability of our OE customers and suppliers to manufacture in the short run. Demand however, remains high in all of our markets. In particular, order activity in the North America Class 8 market continues to be robust averaging over 40,000 units per month in our fiscal second quarter and cancellation rates remain very low.  Overall, as we assess all of the pluses and minuses, we are keeping our global production outlook unchanged as we balance strong global demand with potential supply chain constraints.  Let's turn to slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Consistent with our market assumptions, we are holding forecasted sales to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion unchanged from our prior forecast. We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance steady at an expected range of 10.6% to 10.8%. We are however seeing steel costs continue to increase. Since September hot-rolled coil prices have increased more than 130% and scrap prices are up nearly 100%.  The price movement in steel has been the most severe and rapid increase we have seen over the past 10 years. As a result, we now anticipate a full year headwind of $25 million to $30 million in higher steel costs up $10 million from our prior review. Most of this impact will be felt in our third fiscal quarter as prices begin to reset with our steel suppliers.  While this is a significant headwind in 2021, we do a pass-through mechanism in place with our customers, which are typically on a three- to six-month lag. We expect to see most of this recovery beginning in early fiscal year in 2022.  Additionally, we are increasing our electrification spend between $5 million to $10 million from our prior guidance as we continue to respond to this growing opportunity. While we are experiencing these higher costs, we expect to be able to offset most of these increases through continued operational performance. Our purchasing team has done an excellent job in driving material performance savings and we continue to see the benefits from cost reduction actions executed last year.  Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now in the range of $2.15 to $2.30. This reflects the impact from the adjustment for non-cash taxes as well as the lower interest expense expected from the bond redemption. Our effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% in fiscal 2021 remains unchanged.  And finally, we are maintaining our expectation to generate between $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow. Overall, the team is doing a fantastic job, managing through the challenges of the strong global rebound and deliver a solid glide path to M2022.  Now I will turn the call back over to Chris. Chris Villavarayan : Thanks, Carl. Let's turn to slide 9. While it is difficult to schedule events with certainty, we're planning to hold our Analyst Day in person this year in New York. More details will be provided in the coming months. At that time we will present M2025. We will move of course -- we will of course closely monitor the situation as we move closer to this date to ensure we can meet safely. Before we close I would like to express our concern for the serious situation occurring in India as the pandemic worsens. Our team in the region has taken actions to help employees and the community through care centers, vaccination and mobile testing facilities and we plan to do more. Our thoughts are with our colleagues and their families during this crisis. Again, I want to thank you for joining us today to review Meritor's second quarter results and welcome any questions you may have at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of James Picariello of KeyBanc. James Picariello : Hey, good morning. Chris Villavarayan : Good morning, James. James Picariello : Just within the company's reiterated guide for the year, you're now anticipating what was I think referred to as record commodity inflation in the back half, right not surprisingly, but can you help quantify what the net headwind exposure is relative to what will likely flow through within your recovery mechanism just to get a sense of that net exposure? Carl Anderson : Sure. James, it's Carl. As it relates to steel prices, which is the really primary driver for us we do expect it to be year-over-year about $25 million to $30 million headwind in fiscal 2021. So if you think about the recovery mechanisms as that begins to kind of flow through that will come through really beginning in fiscal -- the first part of fiscal 2022. And so of that we would expect to be recovering around probably $20 million of that number as we go forward. James Picariello : Okay. No that's really helpful. Just from an industry standpoint focusing on the North American market for a second, I mean again from an industry standpoint we're trying to get near record order levels. This year the industry backlogs are also going to be at or close to all-time highs. Are you seeing anything unique in terms of builds build commitments build slot commitments for next year at this point? It just seems as that's where we're going to be especially given the temporary chip shortage impacts which I think are also proving to be more muted. Just seems like we're on track for a really, really strong volumes next year. Chris Villavarayan : For sure, James. I'll take that. So when you think about it it's beyond the last three months. If you look at it it's the last six months. Order intake has come in at 40 or above 40. And to your point, backlogs are passing I think, I believe 300,000. And for our fiscal year right now the midpoint with the recent change is -- it's 285000 for the fiscal between ACT and FTR. And if you look at the midpoint for next year for the heavy market, it's at about 340. So to your point great highs and you got to believe the Texas storms resolved, as well as the fire in Japan. So the chip shortage will get resolved here shortly or will improve shortly. We do believe there is impact through the next couple of quarters, but it eventually should improve. So again we believe there's a strong 2022 ahead of us as well. James Picariello : Got it. If I could just squeeze one more in. Within the aftermarket and industrial segment this quarter's -- the second quarter's margins was there anything within that related to the timing of price increases or excess of premium freight? Just any color on that segment's margins? Carl Anderson : Yes, James, it was really just driven by a couple of factors. One was, we did see some higher freight costs in the second quarter, as well as a little bit higher cost from steel that affected the aftermarket business. James Picariello : Thanks. Carl Anderson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Appreciate it. So I think just to maybe sort of to get a little better sense for some of the costs you talked about Carl in the back half, I think, if we look at the guidance it still implies on a year-over-year basis about 20% incrementals. But I think that seems to be maybe some of the base period in the map, because is it fair to assume that sequentially we should see maybe decrementals a little bit higher than normal given some of the headwinds and then as you can start to get some of those recovery mechanisms back next year that reverts? Carl Anderson : I think that's the right way to think about it Joe. If you look at the six months EBITDA margin performance to-date, we're right around 11.4%. So if you think what our guide is of 10.6% to 10.8% that does imply the second half margins will be about 10% on roughly the same type of revenue. Joseph Spak : Right. Right. Okay. Thank you for that. Just a bigger picture question on electrification. I know you have to --you're up in the spend again here. In the past when you've talked about that it's really sort of been to support programs that you think are sooner rather than later. So maybe if you could just sort of confirm again if that increase of 5% to 10% is for that. And then somewhat related on electrification, can you talk at all about your ability to attach other Meritor products like maybe disc brakes, for instance, like when you get eAxle limbs like is there a pretty high attach rate for Meritor when you're able to do that? Carl Anderson : Absolutely Joe, but I'll start with the first question. First, I think, glad to see the backlog continuing to grow. As you remember, we talked about having this $500 million target for electrification as our revenue pipeline. We accomplished $400 million of that with the -- at the last quarter. And so with this announcement with Hexagon, we've taken a chunk of that. So we continue to see the growth. And to put it in perspective of spend, if you go back to 2019, we spent about $12 million. Last year we spent $21 million, and this year we're moving it up to $35 million to $40 million. So we're almost doubling it per year, and it's primarily because of the wins and it's essentially application and testing of our products as it wins with more customers. To your second question, the ability to attach components, absolutely, we do see a path with brakes -- as primarily with brakes with many of the customers as an opportunity to grow business as well. Joseph Spak : But when you up your electrification backlog, I mean, those associated products I am assuming are not in that. So is it fair to assume the other side of your backlog is being benefited too by the electrification wins? Carl Anderson : It is on, let's call it, everybody that is, let's call it, new entrants coming into the market. So when you think about the new entrants, we have a significant share of the existing traditional business. So it is on the new business, but you also have to take into account when you think about electrification always remember it's five times and up to five times content on a 14Xe, for example. So, we're already seeing that growth as well. Joseph Spak : Okay. Carl maybe just a quick one on -- thanks for the color on the tax rate and sort of the change in guidance. I think you used to sort of point to mid-teens with the way you sort of adjusted. So, should we model something more like 20% in the outer years now given the change? Chris Villavarayan : Well, I think it's -- Joe to that point, it's 15% definitely through 2022. I think once you start getting past 2022 you got to 2023 and 2024; it could begin to moderately step up. So, you're probably not too far off with that assumption. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thanks very much. Chris Villavarayan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Ben Fung : Hi, good morning. This is Ben Fung form JPMorgan for Ryan. I just have two questions. The first one is what is your view on the impact of higher labor cost to margin and production start to come back? And on the same note, how are you seeing freight cost progressing through the rest of the year? I know that someone in the aftermarket last week said something about the freight cost could be two or three times higher than they're seeing right now. So, how much impact to margin do you expect this headwind? And what are some factors that can be used to offset the impact? Thank you. Chris Villavarayan : Absolutely. So, let me start with the first question specific to labor. It's a red hot market out there as you could see with the first question. There's significant drive and demand for the product. And I think it's running right through the economy GDPB being strong and consumer spending. So, in essence, we were able to drive that -- some of that recovery is specific to that with some of our customers. However, on top of that, it's really about operational performance. It's driving incremental operational performance whether it's labor and burden in how we look at our lines or whether it's how we look at material opportunities. So, that's how we drive that savings to offset labor. Specific to freight, we're seeing about three times more freight in terms of cost to your point whether it's on ocean or internal as well. And for those elements what we are again doing is trying to offset a lot of that with -- sorry with material performance and operational performance. But on top of that we also look at working with our customers as well. Ben Fung : And I'm sorry to ask. So, this is pretty cost and everything already factored in the guidance, right? Carl Anderson : Yes, it is. Yes. And to add to what Chris said, as we look at just overall freight costs in our first quarter, we did experience probably higher premium costs associated with the rapid increase in production that we saw in the first quarter. But the -- what we're seeing is kind of just the basic run rate with cost today is all factored into our guidance. Ben Fung : Thank you. Very helpful. And my second question is on the RV business. So, the RV demand has been very strong in the last few months and just this morning an RV dealer up their adjusted EBITDA guidance materially. Can you talk about the opportunity for growth in this area of the business? And I think last quarter you mentioned something about independent suspension. With wheels and motors for RVs? And if you can please just give any update on that? Thank you. Carl Anderson : Absolutely. So, the industrial specialty and off-highway markets are incredibly important for us. This is why we did the AxleTech and Fabco acquisitions two years ago. And so we are seeing the fruits of those acquisitions as we think through 2022 and our -- as we look at our revenue pipeline growth. When we think about the core business and as we have talked about exceeding our revenue targets for 2022, a lot of it is coming in our industrial Defense & Specialty business and a lot of it is driven by this. So we are seeing that growth. Again last quarter we talked about developing an independent suspension for this market. And it is going into production this year and it will be in run-rate next year. And then second is we're also developing a similar system on the electric side. So we're looking at an electric platform that requires to accomplish us the same thing as well for the RV space. Ben Fung : Thank you very much for taking my question. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Matt Milask : Hey good morning, this is Matt Milask on for Bruce Chan. Chris Villavarayan : Good morning Matt. Matt Milask : Morning. With regards to higher freight costs, you mentioned one of the mitigating things that you're doing is working with customers. Any additional color we can get around there and how those conversations might be going? Carl Anderson : Sure. I think when we -- at this point, we are working with customers that we have agreements in certain regions. And as you could imagine, they are hard agreements and they take a while to work through. And it's a discussion that we are working through and we are seeing the benefits in some areas. Matt Milask : Thanks a lot. Chris Villavarayan : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Itay Michaeli : Good morning everybody. Just two quick ones for me. First just a little bit of housekeeping on CapEx. I mean, it looks like it's still running maybe below the full year. And I think the original plan for the cumulative CapEx through 2022 was about $475 million. Just curious whether you're seeing efficiency there if that's just some timing? Carl Anderson : Good morning Itay. It's more timing. For the first six months, we had about $25 million of CapEx. We are planning for about $70 million of CapEx in the last six months of the year. So part of it was production came back pretty quickly as you recall in our first fiscal quarter. And I think some of the programs we are just beginning to ramp back up here this quarter as well as in the fourth quarter for us. Itay Michaeli : Great. That's helpful color. And just -- I think you addressed it to the prior questions, but just as we think about that bridge from the second half margins to the 2022 target, I think you mentioned some of the recoveries on steel. But can you just maybe walk us through some of the bigger puts and takes in terms of what -- at least some of the headwinds that you're facing today that are contractually going to reverse next year particularly on the other steel side? Chris Villavarayan : Yeah. Itay, the biggest thing we're seeing when you really boil it down is really on steel. So as I referenced that $25 million to $30 million headwind is really a second-half story for us. So while freight costs what we've talked about are -- have increased and are elevated from what they have been historically our material performance and some of our operational performance items have been able to offset that. So the true story is steel. And if you were to simply adjust for this deal of $25 million to $30 million; our margins would be very similar to what they are here in the first and second quarter. Itay Michaeli : Got it. Perfect. That\u2019s real helpful. Thanks. Chris Villavarayan : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. And I'll turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo. Todd Chirillo : Great. Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cummins Inc. Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jack Kienzler, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Jack Kienzler : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the Third Quarter of 2021. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jen Rumsey, and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Smith. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the conference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs, and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in this slide. Deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Due during the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www. cummins.com, under the heading of Investors and Media. But with that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger. Tom Linebarger : Thank you, Jack and good morning. Welcome everybody. I'll start with a summary of our Third Quarter financial results and our market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Demand remains strong in the third quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions outside of China. In China, industry-wide sales of trucks and construction equipment is slowed sharply, but in line with our expectations. We remain encouraged by the economic trends in our markets, which point to strong end-user demand extending into 2022. We also continue to see orders for our products outpaced our competition as a result of their strong performance in the field. Unfortunately, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact our ability to produce and ship products, driving up costs and limiting sales growth in the short run. These supply chain constraints are impacting our OEM customers in much the same way. Before getting further into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation products and technologies. In October, we announced that we will bring a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks to the North American market. This engine was launched earlier this year in China and has been well-received in the market, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability this far. The 15-liter natural gas engine is an important part of our path to zero emission strategy, by offering a significant reduction in both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases in a product that's available today and utilizes existing infrastructure. Equally exciting is that this engine is designed to accept a range of gases and renewable fuels, including hydrogen in the future. In fact, all of Cummins' engine platforms are being designed with the same fuel flexibility. At the same time, we are working with Chevron and others in the energy industry to increase the availability of renewable natural gas and other renewable fuels to ensure infrastructure is in place to meet our customers needs. We also signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins, which will produce Cummins branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strengths of momentum fuel technology's compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems and Cummins powertrain expertise along with the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. These are important steps in expanding our portfolio of Power Solutions options to help customers meet their business goals and operation objectives, while also meeting increasingly stringent emission standards and achieving our customers sustainability goals. Now, I will comment on the overall Company performance for the third quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets. Revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were $6 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% compared to $876 million or 17.1% a year ago. Higher freight and logistics expenses, rising material costs and other manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing supply chain challenges in our industry. More than offset the benefits of global volume in increases compared to the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, EBITDA in the third quarter of last year was helped by temporary salary reductions, which lowered our cost by approximately $90 million. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 13% to $3.4 billion, driven by higher engine and component shipments across the heavy and medium-duty on highway markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 55,000 units, increase of 10% from 2020 levels. Cummins sold 22,000 heavy-duty engines in the same period, up 30% from 2020 levels. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 26,000 units in the third quarter, a decrease of 5% from 2020 levels, while our Cummins unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 25% in 2020. We shipped 43,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of this year, a decrease of 2% from 2020 levels, but still a very strong quarter. Revenues for power generation grew by 2% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power, and datacenter markets. Our international revenues increased by 22% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 11% due to lower demand in the medium and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 217,000 units, a decrease of 53% as the industry works through the national standard 5 truck inventory on hand and lower demand for newer higher-cost national standard 6 unit. Our unit sales in units, including joint ventures, were 40,000, a decrease of 49% versus the third quarter last year. Our light-duty engine sales were 33,000, a decrease of 40% driven by supply chain constraints and weaker market demand. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter were 56,000 units, a decrease of 15% from 2020 levels. Our units in Cummins sold were 88,600 units, a decrease of 20%. Power generation sales in China increased 52% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, based on strong demand in data centers and other backup power applications. We continue to hold a market-leading position in the data center segment in China, driven by strong end-user relationships and our compelling product offerings.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $520 million, an increase of 76% from the third quarter of 2020. Industry truck production increased by a 120%, while our shipments increased 135% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. Demand for power generation and construction equipment also rebounded strongly in the third quarter compared to a very low base a year ago. In our Power Systems market, industrial engine revenue increased 33% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year driven by mining in oil and gas. In Brazil, our revenues increased 26% driven by increased demand across all end markets. Now let me quickly cover our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect our revenue to be at the lower end of our guidance are up approximately 20% versus 2020. EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15%, below our previous guidance of 15.5% to 16% of sales. Our expected EBITDA margins are lower because of the persistence of the supply chain constraints and disruptions, which are now exacerbated by escalating material and freight prices. We've lowered our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 228,000 units, up 25% compared to 2020, but below our prior guidance of 264,000 units. This is again due to the supply chain constraints impacting our customers rather than a lack of end-user demand. In the medium-duty trucks market, we are decreasing our forecast for industry production to a 118,000 units, up 15% year-over-year, but below our prior guidance of 134,000 units. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 25% compared to 2020, an increase of 7.5% from our expectations three months ago. In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago. Our 2021 outlook for medium and heavy-duty truck market demand is 1.65 million units, and our 2021 outlook for light-duty trucks market is 2 million units; both unchanged from our previous guidance. We continue to expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2020 and unchanged from our previous guidance. In India, we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 75%,compared to levels experienced in 2020. And our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment, this is also unchanged from previous guidance. We now expect demand for mining engines, to increase 60% in 2021. Up from our expectation of 45% 3 months ago based on continued strength in commodity prices. We continue to expect global power generation revenue to increase 15%, primarily driven by the data-center and recreational vehicle markets. Summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our markets drove continued sales growth in the third quarter. Despite the strong demand, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact both our operations and those of our customers, resulting in higher material and logistics costs, as well as capping revenue growth. We are working collaboratively with our customers and suppliers to navigate these challenges and position the Company for better performance in 2022. Customers are recognizing the strong performance of our products, resulting in our sales growing faster than industry demand in a number of important markets. We continue to invest in bringing new technology to our customers, outgrowing our end markets, and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders. The Company expects to return over 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Thank you for your time today and now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. There are four key takeaways from our third quarter results. End customer demand remains strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth -- strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of China, where truck and construction demand has weakened in line with our expectations. Global supply chains remain constrained, impacting our industry's ability to meet strong customer demand, and resulting in higher freight, labor, and logistics expenses and rising material costs. As a result of the continued supply challenges and associated costs, we are lowering our full-year sales and profitability outlook even though underlying demand remains very strong. Finally, we'll return $345 million to shareholders through cash dividends, and share repurchases in the quarter, and a total of $1.83 billion for the first 9 months of the year consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year. Now let me go into more details on the third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 13% and international revenues rose 22%. EBITDA was $862 million dollars or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $876 million or 17.1% of sales a year ago. As a reminder, EBITDA in Q3 last year would lose by $90 million of temporary salary reductions, and the $44 million VAT recovery in Brazil. Along with the strong demand, the key feature of our performance in Q3 was that our gross margin continues to be challenged by the supply chain constraints and elevated costs. gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.7% of sales increased by $65 million but declined as a percent of sales by 270 basis points. Global supply chain constraints continue to impact the industry's ability to meet elevated and the cost demand and have resulted in higher costs. We incurred approximately $90 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs in the third quarter. in addition to rising material costs, partially offset by increased pricing in the aftermarket. SG&A expenses increased by $38 million or 7%, and research expenses increased by $42 million or 19% from a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April 2020, through the end of September last year. These salary reductions resulted in approximately $90 million of pre -tax savings for the Company last year and impacted gross margin and our operating expenses and impacted the comparisons of the results of all of our operating segments. Joint venture income was $94 million in the third quarter, down slightly from $98 million a year ago due primarily to weaker demand for both trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income of $32 million increased by $11 million year-over-year. Net earnings for the quarter were $534 million or $3.69 per diluted share compared to $501 million or $3.36 per share from a year ago, primarily due to a lower tax rate and a reduced share count. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9%. Our income tax expense included favorable discrete items of $11 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $569 million dollars compared to $1.2 billion dollars a year ago. An increase in working capital led to the lower operating cash flow for this quarter. Now, let me comment on segment performance and our latest guidance for the full-year 2021. For the engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 22% from a year ago, driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in the U.S. and Europe. EBITDA decreased from 18.1% to 15.2%, primarily driven by higher supply chain costs, lower joint venture income, and higher compensation expense, partially offset by the benefits of stronger volumes and lower warranty expense. But the full year, we've reduced our revenue guidance to be 24% at the midpoint, down 1% for the full year. We now expect EBITDA margins to be between 14.2% and 14.7% a little below our prior year guidance of 14.5% to 15% primarily due to the weaker sales on ongoing supply chain challenges. In the distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago. EBITDA increased in dollars but decreased as a percent of sales from 10.6% to 9.8% primarily due to some of the supply chain challenges but again the higher compensation costs. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for distribution segment revenues to be up 8% and increased EBITDA margins to 9.3% of sales at the midpoint of our guidance. Component segment, revenues increased 16% in the third quarter, driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.1% primarily due to higher supply chain costs and higher warranty expenses compared to very, very low cost of quality in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we now expect components revenue to increase 28%, lower than our prior guidance of up 32%, primarily driven by a weaker outlook in North America and slightly lower outlook for China truck. We have also lowered our forecast EBITDA margins for the segment to be at 15.5% of sales at the midpoint, down from our prior guidance of 17%, as this segment is being more hardly -- has been hit harder by the supply chain challenges and the slowdown in truck production in North America and China. In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 19% in the third quarter, driven by stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased by $33 million, and expanded by 10.3 to 11.5% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expense. Partially offset by elevated supply chain costs. For the full year we're increasing our power systems revenue guidance to be up 22% from our prior guide of 18% growth driven primarily by a stronger outlook in the mining segment. We're also increasing our EBITDA margin forecast to be 11.5% of sales at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 11.25. In the new power segment, revenue increased $23 million, up 28% due to stronger sales of battery electric system. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $58 million as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies that we're developing. For the full year, we now project new power revenues of $120 million at the midpoint, and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $200 million. We expect total Company revenues now to grow approximately 20% at the low-end of our prior guidance. We're also lowering our EBITDA margin guidance to be approximately 15% for the full year, down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16%. A slower pace of improvement in North American truck production and continued elevated costs associated with the global supply chain challenges were the primary drivers of the lower outlook. We expect joint venture earnings to be up 10% for this year in line with our prior [Indiscernible]. We're forecasting our full-year effective tax rate to be 21.5%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were a $150 million in the quarter, up from a $116 million a year ago, when we continue to expect full-year capital spend of between $725-$775 million. To summarize, we faced incredibly strong demand in many of our core markets but continue to face global supply chain challenges which have impacted our cost base, and more so than we'd expected in the second half of the year. However, this end customer demand remains strong, outpacing supply in many important markets and setting us up for a strong 2022, assuming the global economy remains strong. I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless work this year to ensure that we've meet the needs of our customers while continuing to deliver solid financial results. We continue to prioritize improving our performance cycle-over-cycle, investing in technologies that will power profitable growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for your interest today. And now let me turn it back over to Jack. Jack Kienzler : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. And if you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, [Operator Instructions]. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Again, [Operator Instructions]. And as just previously stated, please make sure you're limiting yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question is come -- sorry, our first question is coming from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephen Volkmann : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I'll just dive in on some of these supply chain issues. Is it possible to just bucket the impact that you guys have seen? I'm thinking about price costs being a headwind, I'm thinking about logistics costs I think you gave us a number for that Mark. I'm guessing there's probably some productivity headwinds. I'm just trying to see if we can better understand exactly what you're seeing relative to these supplier interruptions. Mark Smith : Happy to do that and good morning, Steve. So yes, we are almost 2% worse between the price we've recovered in -- well, not recovered. The price increases that we've made principally in the aftermarket this year, which has added about 70 basis points to our results. And we've lost yeah, more than 2.5 points between the premium freight, rising material costs, and inefficiencies in our operations. And that's a little bit -- that's higher obviously than when anticipated 3 months ago. We did see a reduction in premium freight from the second quarter to the third quarter, but we started to see more increase on the material cost side. Stephen Volkmann : And Mark, is it too early? I mean, I'm assuming for 2022 year goal will be to get right with that. Or maybe even a little bit better. I don't know, any commentary you can make as we go out into '22? Mark Smith : I will just say this continues to be a high area of focus both on our operation side and also working through this with suppliers and customers and implementing price increases. Tom Linebarger : Hey Steve, this is Tom, the one thing that everybody is still worried about in our industry is semiconductors. It's not that things haven't improved some because they have, but it's marginal improvement. It's still a really tight supply chain, so there's a lot of issues across the supply chain, labor shortages, freight, etc. But semiconductors look like they're -- they have a longer-term capacity issue and I'd also say the freight side of things just seems like it's not quite getting better yet when you look at where containers are and what ports look like. So there's no question that, as Mark said, internally, we are working as much as we can to address our cost side inefficiencies. He talked about going out and negotiating price increases, and as you know on the material cost side, those come automatically, but we'll have to negotiate for the rest. It's just that some of these things look like they are likely to be somewhat persistent. That doesn't mean we're not hoping to improve them all. I just want to be realistic about those. There'll be some element that looks like it goes into next year too. Stephen Volkmann : Understood. Thank you, I guess high freight costs are probably good long-term for you guys, but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Thanks. Operator : Yeah. Mark Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I guess Tom, I just wanted to get more color from you on how you're thinking about China as we head into 2022, that's an important market for you. And what, in terms of like the power shortages and outages over there, how that's impacting your business goals from a negative perspective and potentially a positive perspective over time. I -- so I guess I'll start there. Tom Linebarger : Yeah. Let me let Jen talk a little bit about how the China market is now and how we're seeing it, and I can jump back in and see us talk about sort of longer-term things. Jamie Cook : Okay. Jennifer Rumsey : Hi, Jamie. As you heard from Mark, and we've been forecasting, we've seen a drop-off at the middle of the year in the China market -- on-highway market in particular, with the changeover between NS V and NS VI emission standards. So we saw inventory building up in the first half of the year and we're now seeing that coming down and getting sold in regions that are still allowing NS V product sales. And so that combined with a higher cost of the new emissions product has, as we expected, driven a drop in on-highway demand, which we expect to come back to some degree. 2020 was a record year for China though, so our expectation is that market's going to come back to be more in line with what we saw in '19 for on-highway. We are benefiting in China from additional content in the components business with new emissions requirements and also the launch of the endurance transmission now in China. So we see that benefit and we think our NS-VI products are going to performed well in the market as well and give us some upside potential. But the market overall is down. The construction market has also come down some and we are continuing to see some strength in the power gen market there. We are watching the impact of those power shortage issues in China very closely with our suppliers, it's not created a major disruption for us to this point, but it is something we continue to watch closely. Tom Linebarger : Yeah. I would just pick up from where Jen left off, the power shortages as she said. Some impacts on production, but not a huge cost impact. But as you suggested, Jamie, we do think it helps us in the market. And as I mentioned in my remarks, our power-gen business is positioned well in China and now I look at China and I see us positioned across all of our markets. The truck side, as Jen said, we've now got -- our automatic transmissions are taking off, our content across the engines is growing. There's more consolidation in the market. So as things start to come back, I think we're better positioned we've ever been. Add to it, that we're now doing electrolyzers with a partner in China. We've got fuel-cell launches in China. So on the new power side, while things are moving slower in China than maybe and people anticipated several years ago, that's just allowed us to position ourselves to be in those markets more strongly as they take off. So again, today -- looking where I am today, I'd say our position in China has really never been stronger. So, yeah. Do I wish the market was stronger this year? Sure. But I think as it turns back down, we're able to consolidate more and strengthen our position. Jennifer Rumsey : And we have the new N15 natural gas product launched in China as well now, and that I think positions us better for what's a fairly sizable natural gas market in China as well. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk to how far your order book extent today and to what degree there's risks that the order book has unfavorable pricing in it, and are you concerned about double ordering at all? Thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah. I mean, at this point, the demand out there is very strong. We're seeing growing back orders in some of our businesses. And I've been out in recent couple of months talking with both OEMS and customers and there is strong demand out there that for sure is real at this point, customers are not getting all the trucks that they would like to get this year and do not believe even looking into next year, they think that there's going to be some limitations. I think that orders are strong and as Tom said, we've got some contractual pricing on metals that we'll get, as we go into next year. We've been taking pricing actions where we go direct to the market and aftermarket on PowerGen, and we're continuing to work with our OEM customers, on first-fit to negotiate pricing just in light of that cost environment we see right now. Jamie Cook : Thank you very much. Tom Linebarger : Thanks Jamie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ann Duignan of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ann Duignan : Hi. Good morning. Thank you, Just to follow up on the supply chain, a quick follow-up, please. Would you expect, the announcement that we're eliminating the European tariffs on steel and aluminum to have any impact on U.S. steel prices in 2022? Tom Linebarger : Hi Ann I'm Tom, it's good to hear you. I really don't know because again, there are, as you know, export, I mean, sorry, import caps on that too. So how much that's going to really impact prices is unclear to me. And demand, of course, for metals is pretty high now. So the markets are pretty well-supported. In fact, our mining, you saw our mining numbers are up and that's primarily driven by metal prices. So just in the U.S., it feels to me like it's going to have moderate long-term impact. Short-term, it may provide a little bit of relief, but I would have said that given the import caps, it's probably not a big move medium or long term. Ann Duignan : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color on that and my real question though is more fundamental. I mean, you're talking about the 15-liter engine being able to use fuels like hydrogen as their major fuel. If it's so easy to convert a 15-liter internal combustion engine to burning hydrogen, why are we investing in fuel-cells at all? If we can do it with just a new fuel injection system or some minor re-engineering of an internal combustion engine, why go down the path of the hydrogen investments or in particular fuel cells at all? Tom Linebarger : Well, as you know, the hydrogen investments would be the same. Still we would need to generate hydrogen and, of course, we need green hydrogen in order to actually reduce the CO2 impact of the fuel. And really, hydrogen combustion is a good answer. It's just not as efficient as a fuel cell. So if you're running our long-haul heavy-duty trucks where fuel is your number one cost or power energy is, then that efficiency increase from a fuel cell is going to be worth it to you. If you have a relatively short range or you have a vocational truck, our view is maybe a hydrogen engine might work for you, especially if the conversion to fuel cell is too expensive and you're not having that many units. So our view is there's a place for both, but if you want to think what's going to really drive the transportation economy 20 years -- 15 years from now, you're going to need the efficiency that a fuel cell, especially with an electric system, is going to provide. So our feeling still as fuel sales win, for the majority of the trucking industry, but we -- hydrogen engines are a real addition to the portfolio of products that are -- can be available across our markets. Jennifer Rumsey : And there's a time factor too, as you can imagine. As fuel cells advanced and costs come down, and maybe there are period of time where hydrogen engines are having an economic advantage, but as Tom said over time costs come down, that efficiency benefit for customers that are really driven strictly by total costs on ownership. May -- we think will drive a shift toward fuel cell and applications like Line Haul. Ann Duignan : Okay, I'll take mine more engineering relented questions offline and then Jennifer Rumsey : You have a lot of them. I'm going to be Jamie to be Tom Linebarger : Ann [Indiscernible] Jennifer Rumsey : Ann, I'm going to be happy to have a longer conversation -- Ann Duignan : I'm over-simplifying just simple fuel injection system re-engineering. Jennifer Rumsey : Exactly, I think taken 30 Second on it, we're designing this platform that the physical hardware for flexibility is exactly as you said, this fuel system and some other components differences and then the tuning. Of course, the calibration and control of the engine is different based on the fuel, but we're able to leverage some of that manufacturing and engineering investment in a common platform. Ann Duignan : Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Appreciate that. Tom Linebarger : Thank you, Ann. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tse of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Tim Tse : Thank you. Good morning. The question really is just hoping you could give some help in terms of how we should think about the relationship between heavy and medium-duty engine sales for Cummins versus Industry truck production, both in the fourth quarter and then as we get into '22. I'm just thinking about how you out pacing the industry as your OEM customers deal with all these red-tag trucks. How should we think about that, again, relationship? Obviously, a global impact or maybe just thinking about the heavy-duty segment here in the near term. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, there's a couple of dynamics. So of course, we've added some additional OEM customers. So when you think about our sales through OEMS and medium-duty and heavy-duty. And you saw -- you heard some of the numbers around how much of the total market we're seeing with Cummins engine. So we feel really well-positioned, our products are performing well, there's a lot of end-user pull and we've seen good position in the market. The dynamic that is happening in the fourth quarter, in most cases, we have been able to work through the supply constraints and continue to supply to our OEM customers and have not, in most cases, been the reason they've not been able to build trucks.  So as they take down some of their build rate, stabilize their production and complete these trucks that they build short of some components. We have seen some reduction in demand on the engine itself as they're working to really stabilize and get to more efficient build rates to make sure they are building with what supply and inventory they have and level that out. So that is impacting that in the fourth quarter and in part why we adjusted our revenue guidance. Mark Smith : What I would add Tim is what we see is our products are performing incredibly well. We see it in our financials with very positive results on cost of quality and overall strong sense of enthusiasm for the products that we're putting in the market. Invariably, you're going to get some volatility quarter-to-quarter, as we always do, but we feel really good about the position of our products in the market. I think that's the message when you step back and when we're done with this year and and we look at the message you want you to leave with, and, of course, we're optimistic about picking up more business over time. Tim Tse : Got it. And then Mark just on the margin impact in components. Obviously, a lot of metals and platinum and palladium and etc. used there, and I know there's always a time lag. Is there a way to think about the margin impact this year that's effectively a timing gap that you get the presume the -- presuming things stabilize, which maybe is a wrong assumption, but is there a way to think about what is more of a short-term impact that gets reversed next year or is it too hard to piece that part? Mark Smith : If I just step back because there's a lot of noise year-over-year because some of the actions we took last year, the boosted results for us to step back from the noise of the numbers. I'll come back to that in a moment. Really, we're wrestling with three issues in that business that are somewhat different than we'd anticipated 3 or 6 months ago. Number one, for the production in North America has not picked up in the second half of the year, if anything, it's drifted down a little bit. And we were counting on that in our guidance. So we think underlying demand supports are robust environment for next year, and that should take care of itself. Number 2, whilst we anticipated a sharp drop in the second half of the year in China and that's playing out largely as we've expected. This business is doing a major product transition for NS-5 to NS-6. And in variable when we start with the launch of new products, will below optimal scale, demand is still pretty light for NS-6 so as we ramp up, we'd expect margins to recover. The bigger challenge, or the more, naughty challenges the rise in supply chain costs, which is really what we've seen when in the first half of the year we saw OEMS principally, availability impacting our operations, supply chain and the engine business. We've seen that spread more to more electrical components. And what's happened is the components business has picked up more cost and efficiency. So that one's not you were working Mark Smith : through all that. Yes, we got the metal costs, we got the normal contractual adjustments around that. But it's that focus on the supply chain and the other actions that we talked about at the start of the call that we're focused on here. But I just wanted to try and simplify the message. There's a lot of noise out there. I'll just say one other thing just -- you didn't ask me, just clear up some noise I hear. Whilst -- in the explanations, we mentioned higher product coverage costs in this segment, it's compared to an extraordinarily low number last year. There's no big charge for product coverage or warranty in the segments. I just wanted to clear that up for other listeners. Thank you. Tim Tse : Got it. All right. Thanks for the time, Mark. Mark Smith : Cheers, Tim. Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Tom Linebarger : Hi, Jerry. Jennifer Rumsey : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Tom, you folks target structural improvements in the business every cycle and I'm wondering as you look at the supply chain challenges that the entire industry face here, how are you folks thinking about potential changes in the way you manage inventories or the way you manage the supply chain going forward? Is there an opportunity to reduce some of the volatility by meaningfully increasing inventories given where cost of debt is, etc.? wondering how you're thinking about positioning comments coming out of this pretty complex environment we're facing here. Tom Linebarger : Jerry, it's a terrific question, and as you can imagine, it's been on my mind for a while. We did -- early in the pandemic we did do some structural reform. I think we talked about on some previous calls trying to say, hey, well, the market's down, let's make sure that we get our capacity rightsize and I think we did some good work early on on that. But with the supply chain challenges, we've also seen a bunch of new problems that we weren't seeing before. You highlighted some of them. Do we have enough inventory in the right places? Are we outsourced in places we should be insourced? And then of course with trade challenges between countries, are we relying too much on cross-border trade. So all those things now are in our strategy looking forward about how we want to reposition our supply chain. So today what we're doing is trying to get our costs down, trying to get our production up to meet customer demand, and trying to keep our supply chain people at work. when it's -- they're basically working 24/7. It's been really, really rough, so I would just say that the strategic elements, while we're doing a lot of work and analysis on them, there's no question that we've taken a backseat to try to keep operations going in the last couple of quarters. But those issues are first and foremost, for us and the leadership team, thinking about how we want to position. And I will just say this, broadly speaking, what we're thinking about is we do need to reposition what we outsourced and what we in-source for the future, partly because of some of the supply chain challenges we've seen here, but also because the industry is likely to consolidate further. And we need to make sure that we can be the reliable supplier that we need to be for our customers. So we will be looking at that and thinking through where the right way to position ourselves in different supply chains is, but I think you've hit on a key point that there will be some optimization that will be helpful to us, both from a cost and reliability point-of-view overtime. Jerry Revich : Terrific. On a separate note, I'm wondering if you could talk about the outlook for your electrification opportunities in off-highway markets, obviously a pretty fragmented supplier base in terms of other engine systems in the market now. How do you see that as an opportunity set for comments and are there significant major new product milestones that we should look forward to as you folks electrify the off-highway offerings? Tom Linebarger : As you said, off highway is more fragmented and generally speaking, conversations are a phase behind on highway in battery electric power trains, but they are common. As you'd guess, every major off highway producers trying to figure out what their long-term strategy is from carbon point of view and sustainability point of view. We are having conversations with many of them. In all cases, I think the battery electric conversation, it is at a high level strategically as the same thing. All of them need a solution. All of them want to figure out when is the costs -- the total cost of ownership for end-users work out and it generally doesn't today unless you're in a publicly financed application. If you're in a train or a bus or a ferry, okay. If you're in a commercially viable thing, it doesn't quite work out yet, but the numbers as you know are changing quickly, but it still doesn't work out. So they are trying to figure out how to position themselves for when it does work out, who they partner with, and how. And today, most of those partnership conversations are pushed out because there's not a viable offering to make today, nor is there a way to get to a viable offering within technologies and the costs as they are now. So everyone's looking forward trying to figure out what does it look like. Off-highway, I believe, strategically, will be in the same challenge that they're in today. Not enough volume to justify a special one, but very specific needs to their application. And our view is that Cummins will be well-positioned because we will have products and on-highway which will give us volume and scale and then we will have an understanding of their application and how to adapt the technologies most effectively to off-highway so that we'll represent a good partner to them, and as you guessed, that sort of the pitch I'm making to them now that we'd be the right partner for them in battery electric as we are with engines. Jerry Revich : I appreciate the discussion. Thanks. Tom Linebarger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, I wonder if you could kind of update us on how the naturaliser pipeline is developing. I think we've seen some of the companies in the industry just a really robust demand growth since the start of the year. And if you can also comment, obviously it's not set in stone, but there appear to be some pretty healthy incentives for nitrogen production in the reconciliational provision. So just wondering if you'd comment on potential impact of that outgrow the business? Tom Linebarger : Yeah. He thinks -- no I appreciate your question and the answer is, we have continued to see backlog growth in the electrolyzer business, and I'd say the big strategic move we wanted to make was to add some bigger projects to the backlog and those conversations have been going much better in a backlog. I think last time we checked with 60 megawatts or something quite a good backlog, some newer larger projects which were exciting to add in there. And of course the problem with larger projects, they take longer to get together, and more likely delays in funding, but that's where the market's going. We need to have those big ones, so it was good to see some of those come into backlog. and I would just say that the interest in electrolyzers is still quite strong. As you mentioned, the bill -- the Build Back Better Plan has some incentives in there for producing hydrogen, especially low -- carbon-free ammonia. We think that's going to be a good use of electrolyzers in the early phase of electrolyzers. We see it in Europe where there's a carbon price already. We see it in some fertilizer-related projects and it's an area where there's a lot of carbon used in fertilizer through gray hydrogen and making that hydrogen green is a way -- there's already demand calculations about how to get cost. Equivalency are pretty straightforward. They're not easy, they take some funding and they take some incentives, which is why you see those in the bill. But once you do the calculations, you can see how you can get there, so I do expect that to be one of the markets that's likely to move more quickly, especially if those incentives make it through into law. I do think it will promote the green hydrogen -- green nitrogen, I guess the green ammonia business pretty quickly in the U.S. Noah Kaye : Thanks. And then just on a different topic, wonder if we could get any update on the filtration business, particularly in light of the comments made earlier about some of the operational changes or realignment from a high level that you're planning. Where you at in terms of exploring the alternatives for that business? Mark Smith : Hi Noah, this is Mark. Yes, we continue to make progress in pursuing the alternatives for that business. Our plans are unchanged and you should expect an update in the new year as we continue that work. Will be no -- I don't anticipate any significant change in the remaining three months. But an update in the new year and the direction and the enthusiasm for that process remains unchecked. And I will just say the performance of that business has also been very strong this year that. It's embedded within the components business, but the business continues to do very well. Noah Kaye : Yes. Thanks very much, Mark. Mark Smith : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Elkott of Cowen. Please go ahead. Matt Elkott : Good morning. Thank you. So guys, in the U.S., we're looking at significant upcycles in truck production as well as construction and mining equipment. As these upcycles begin to unfold, are there opportunities for you guys to increase the percentage of your engines with your customers, both on-highway and off-highway? And if I take it a bit longer term, are there opportunities for potentially gaining new customers who may currently be fully integrated? Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, great question. We are constantly working to make sure that we have the most competitive engine in the market that drives end-user pull and grows our position in the market and also ensuring that we have capacity to meet OEM s' needs through strong cycles. And we continue to have conversations. You've seen announcements around the partnerships with Isuzu, with Hino, with Dymo. We're continuing to have those conversations with customers that may not offer Cummins engines today to introduce those in the future. So we expect that those opportunities will continue over time. Matt Elkott : So generally, during an OEM cyclical production up-cycle, does the vertical integration usually go up or down for the OEMS? Tom Linebarger : Matt, it depends, but at the very top of the market, generally speaking, our penetration goes up a little bit because they run out of capacity if they use both, if they have both their own demand and ours. But again, generally is not a good indicator for a given quarter and as Mark was saying earlier, quarter-to-quarter variation is pretty high because they may have backlogs. In this case, they may have unfinished trucks with more of their engine. So just quarter-to-quarter, it's hard to see. What's more is because of the supply chain challenges, right now, OEM truck production is capped by suppliers. So we're not anywhere near the maximum production of the industry today. I mean, we hope to be based on what engine users demand, but we're not. We're in an area where they can produce more if they could get more parts. So I think we're not really near the spot that you're asking about in terms of industry production. Matt Elkott : Got it. Next [Indiscernible] Tom and then just one follow-up question on the natural gas engine. In the U.S. it's very small. I think it's -- you guys produce about 10,000 engines and you dominate the market. With the 15-liter engine, can you talk about the growth opportunity and when you could see it unfold? I mean, is it going to be a meaningful opportunity next year or is this more longer-term? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So the plan -- we've announced that we're bringing this N15 natural gas engine that we have in production in China now into the U.S. market by '24. So we're couple of years out from offering that product. As I've talked to end customers, they are very excited about this product and in particular, as they pursue their own goals for carbon reduction. In the coming years, they see natural gas as a great way to meet those, including using renewable natural gas. So we expect some upside opportunities as we bring that new platform into the market and also some growing interest yo natural gas in the market. Mark Smith : Which again should boost our share given our position in natural gas, yeah. Matt Elkott : Thank you very much. Tom Linebarger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. You guys touched on pricing earlier, could you remind us maybe just give a quick recap overview of how pricing works on engine platforms. Is that the only one where you have constraints on what price that includes material costs, escalators, but not freight maybe if I understand right. And then, what portion of the mix do you then have to go after things like freight on? Tom Linebarger : Broadly speaking, Rob, the way it works is that we have OEM long-term agreements with large customers for engines and the major components. That's the sort of sectors where you'll see some of those long-term agreements. The benefit of those, of course, is that we can count on continued customer orders over a period of time over phase of production of trucks and engines. And the pricing arrangements in those for the most part, again, they're -- each one's a little different, but the general deal is it on basic material costs. There's an escalator or a pass-through, and on the rest, you need to negotiate if you want to make a change. Doesn't mean you can't negotiate, just means you have to negotiate with your partner. And then on generator sets and aftermarket where we go directly to retail customers, then we only have what's on the order book as what's what you can -- you can't price on. So as Mark and Jen said, we -- this year, we priced in the aftermarket. Early in the year, we priced in the aftermarket again. In the middle of the year, and we always are looking back at that to see if we should do more. And then gen sets we also move pricing right away. And then now what we're doing is talking with all of our OEM customers about the fact that we've had these escalators, not just freight, by the way, freight, logistics, material costs, special shipments as a result of delays in semiconductors, and other products that we want to recover from them, and we're in negotiations with them now. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Tom, thinking about an overview on -- you touched on it earlier on semiconductors. Do you have a sense on when you think the industry be in better shape and what does Cummins doing specifically I'd love your re-qualifying supplier, qualifying new suppliers, redesigning chips, etc, before the industry gets better? I'll stop there, thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, I will comment on that one. So it's something we've been working really closely throughout the year and we've started to see some improvement quarter-over-quarter since the middle of the year and supply of microprocessors for most of our components that we've seen some growing disruption on other electrical components. That has become a bigger issue for us in the second half of the year. And we have also in parallel been working and I think we'll revisit inventory strategies as we are able to build inventory. Not today in the current very constrained environment. And we're also looking at, sourcing strategy and doing dual-sourcing back all the way to a tier 3 level to make sure we've got more flexibility in the future. Tom Linebarger : And Rob, the thing we really needed in the U.S of course, as we need, we need domestic semiconductor production that's targeted at the automotive industry. That's -- I mean, that's -- I don't mean to be pie in the sky about it, but strategically, it's kind of a nightmare that we only have -- all those semiconductor wafers are coming from pretty much one factory or one set of factories in Taiwan, and that we're a very small part of that Company's output. That's not the ideal situation for a supply chain. So if you ever said, hey, what's the strategic plan? The strategic plan has to be defined semiconductor manufacturers who think the automotive industry is more critical to their success and ideally to have some closer to shore onshore so that we can look at the total capacity and demand, because right now most automotive -- most trucks and buses are adding a significant portion of electronics. Each revolution or each time that their new product ramps come out, they add 30% more chips or sensors or something, and that's not the way the industry semiconductor -- the capacity of the semiconductors is moving. So we need to add more capacity and we need to add it -- target it at those customers. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. Jack Kienzler : Thank you, Tom. And thank you, everybody. I believe that concludes our teleconference today. As always, thank you to everybody for your continued interest in Cummins and for joining today. I will be available for questions after the call. Thank you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast and enjoy the rest of your day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Todd Chirillo : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 earnings call. On the call today, we have Chris Villavarayan, CEO and President; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris. Chris Villavarayan : Good morning. Thank you for joining the call today to discuss Meritor's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Once again, we delivered solid financial performance. We achieved our full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin and exceeded adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.23, while simultaneously expanding our reach into electrification. We accomplished this during significant supply chain disruption and labor issues in the United States. I want to thank the Meritor team and supply partners for working closely with our customers to optimize production and delivery. As shown on Slide 3, we had good conversion on higher revenue as global demand snapped back. Extraordinarily high input costs obviously impacted our margin for the quarter and the year, but all things considered, we're extremely pleased with the result. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the circumstances were demanding, we remained intently focused on safety, quality and delivery. We ended the year with strong metrics that give us a path to achieve our M2022 goals. With 50% of our facilities having zero recordable incidents in the year, I commend these teams for the work they did to maintain a safe working culture in a challenging environment. Our excellent quality for the year resulted in customer PPM of 23. Four of our facilities and three of our joint venture operations received the Daimler Masters of Quality Award, which recognizes outstanding suppliers with scores for quality, delivery, technology and cost performance. We're proud to say that including this year, we have earned 55 Masters of Quality Awards from Daimler over the years. We believe this level of quality differentiates us in the industry, as does our delivery rate of 96% this year. While not as high as a typical year where we consistently run 99%, we view this as an accomplishment considering the prolonged supply and labor disruption the industry is experiencing. As the commercial vehicle industry advances towards electric vehicles, we view every prototype agreement, collaboration and partnership as an important opportunity. Each one is a validation of our technology solution that could lead to a production contract as customers finalize their market strategies and architecture choices. Every quarter this year, we announced new agreements to expand our customer base and for electrification. This quarter is no exception. Please turn to Slide 5. First, Axos is electric mobility company that designs and manufactures medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks that travel on last mile back-to-base routes of less than 200 miles per day. Under a prototype agreement, Axos will evaluate and test Meritor's ePowertrain with the intention of taking it to production in future platforms. We also have a new collaboration with Electra commercial vehicles. Meritor will work with Electra to bring electrified commercial vehicles to Europe city centers, integrating Meritor's electric powertrain into an IVECO-based road sweeper application will allow Electra to replace its remote drive conversion solution and test a more efficient and compact electric powertrain. With Meritor's technical architecture, Electra can maximize the space for batteries, which will allow the vehicles to sweep more road surface in a single shift. Finally, we're proud to be a part of the U.S. Department of Energy Super Truck 3 program in collaboration with PACCAR. The goal of this program is to develop zero-emission medium-and heavy-duty trucks. Let's go to Slide 6 for a look at the significant number of diverse electrification agreements we have announced in fiscal 2021. From production awards to prototypes, medium duty to heavy, we're growing through new and existing customer relationships. In 2020, we announced the PACCAR and Volkswagen electrification production program. This fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2020, we've more than tripled the value of new EV wins and further diversified our customer base. We're also growing our opportunities in the medium-duty application space. Here, we historically have not had a large share. We have now booked electrification business of almost $0.5 billion. On Slide 7, we wanted to recap the important activity in our core business during the year. We extended contracts with Navistar and IVECO and secured new business with industrial and truck customers in India and the United States. We're on track to exceed our M2022 new business win target by approximately $100 million. Keep in mind, we expect the sustained growth of our core business to fund the growth of our electrification business as the customer base and product portfolio continues to grow. I will now turn it over to Carl for the financial details. Carl Anderson : Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and provide an outlook for fiscal year 2022. Despite significant headwinds in the supply chain and operating environment, we delivered solid financial performance in our fiscal year. We converted on incremental revenue at 18%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 180 basis points to 10.7%, increased adjusted earnings per share by 176% to $2.68 and generated $107 million of free cash flow. Now let's turn to Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in Commercial Truck were $740 million, up over 30% year-over-year. The increase in sales was driven by higher global truck production in all markets. A year ago at this time, we were just starting to recover from pandemic-related shutdowns. Segment adjusted EBITDA for Commercial Truck was $54 million, up $30 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 7.3%, an increase of 300 basis points from a year ago. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and margin was driven primarily by conversion on the higher revenue. This was partially offset by higher freight and steel costs. Aftermarket & Industrial sales were $250 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. The majority of this was driven by higher order activity in our North America aftermarket business. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat year-over-year. However, margins were impacted by higher freight costs, resulting in a 140 basis point decrease. For the full year, sales rose to over $3.8 billion, up 26% from last year due to strong global demand and higher truck production in all of our markets. Production in India more than doubled. South America was up 50%, and Class 8 production in North America increased by 20%. Net income from continuing operations was $200 million compared to $244 million in the prior year. You will recall last year, we recognized more than $200 million of income, net of tax, associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly-owned Brazilian entity of $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, we recognized $10 million in net tax benefits from certain tax initiatives that were implemented in the fourth quarter of this year. Adjusted EBITDA was $411 million in fiscal year 2021, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, an increase of 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin year-over-year was driven primarily by conversion on higher sales, partially offset by increased freight, steel and electrification costs. In total, higher steel and freight costs were an $84 million headwind in 2021. During the year, ocean container costs nearly quadrupled, hot-rolled steel increased over 250% and scrap costs double. Had we not faced these increased costs in steel and freight, our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2021 would have been significantly higher, demonstrating how well the underlying business is performing. Additionally, we also incurred $21 million in higher electrification expense as we continue to invest for the future. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, an increase of $1.71 from the prior year. This does exclude the $15 million in tax credits from Brazil and the $10 million of tax initiatives I mentioned earlier. And finally, free cash flow was $107 million compared to $180 million last year. Keep in mind, our 2020 free cash flow included the $265 million benefit in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. In 2021, we also had an approximately $70 million increase in our working capital requirements as we secured supply for our customer needs and prepare for another increase in volumes in 2022. Now let's review our global production outlook on Slide 9. We continue to see strong demand across our global markets. However, global supply chain constraints continue to impact production for our customers and the industry which we expect to continue into next year. In North America, we expect Class 8 production to be in the range of 270,000 to 290,000 units, an increase of almost 7% at the midpoint from 2021. While order activity has begun to moderate, there have been over 320,000 Class 8 trucks ordered since January. Additionally, the backlog in September was approximately 280,000 units, which is approaching the previous all-time high set in October 2018. Overall, we expect production to be limited only by constraints in the supply chain. In Europe, our production outlook is in the range of 410,000 to 430,000 units as we continue to see stable product levels on the continent. In Brazil, we expect strong demand to continue as 2021 was the highest Class 8 truck production in this region since 2014. We expect production next year in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 units. And in India, we project a slight increase from the prior year as production in the region continues to rebound. Let's turn to Slide 10 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We are projecting our full year sales to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. In addition to revenue growth based on the production forecast I discussed, we expect approximately $100 million in incremental sales related to new business wins as part of M2022 plan. We also continue to recoup steel costs from our pass-through recovery mechanisms, which we expect will increase revenue in the range of $100 million to $150 million compared to last year. Moving to our margin outlook. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Our guidance range is wider than normal due to the continued uncertainty in the overall operating environment. We continue to see significant headwinds from steel and freight and anticipate these costs to be an incremental headwind of $70 million to $110 million as compared to 2021. We are executing on recovery and pricing actions to help offset some of the cost pressures we are seeing. In total, we currently are planning for $50 million to $80 million of actions, which will be more fully realized starting in our second quarter. In addition, we expect several tailwinds in fiscal year 2022. First, we will continue to drive operational performance in the business, and we will complete our previously announced footprint consolidation initiative in the first quarter, providing a $12 million to $15 million year-over-year improvement. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2022 is approximately $3.25 to $3.75. Keep in mind, this outlook is based on our revised reporting of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share that we changed in the second quarter of 2021, which excludes the benefit of noncash tax adjustments we had previously included when we announced the M2022 plan back in November 2018. And finally, we now expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million as working capital stabilizes and we convert on incremental sales. Overall, the team continues to remain focused on delivering superior financial performance in the final year of our M2022 plan. Now I will turn the call back over to Chris for some closing remarks. Chris Villavarayan : As Carl stated, our guidance ranges for this fiscal year are wider than usual due to the volatility we have grown accustomed to in the past few quarters. However, we are focused on delivering excellent financial results. Slide 11 provides M2022 highlights. We're particularly excited about the growth we see and plan to achieve in our core business and advanced technology. Meritor recognizes the future is electric. Our success in 2021 and our legacy in the commercial vehicle and brake business will position us well to capitalize on the growing adoption of electric vehicles around the world. As we look at the next decade, we expect the rate of adoption to dramatically increase heading towards 2030. And as the market shifts to electric powertrains, we believe Meritor's content per vehicle will grow significantly. Please turn to Slide 12. We hope you will join us for Meritor's Virtual Strategy Day on December 7. At that time, we will dimension our growth expectations as the industry transforms to electrification and share exciting new business wins with you. Following that event, we will have a live Q&A. So please mark that on your calendars. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Jason Stuhldreher : Team, this is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. Congrats on finishing fiscal year '21. I was hoping maybe just on the outlook first. The incremental margins that the outlook seems to imply, if we kind of exclude the recoveries that you're getting and then the additional steel and freight cost, it looks to be in sort of the low 30-ish percent range, which is higher than we've seen in the past. And you kind of mentioned some one-off factors, but hoping you could sort of kind of dimensionalize what your kind of expected standalone incremental margins would be? And then what the benefits of sort of finishing the footprint consolidation and other factors for next year? Carl Anderson : Sure. It's Carl. I can address that question. Yes, as we look at the incrementals going into 2022, a couple of things to keep in mind. I would say kind of just on base revenue, our expectation now with all of the actions we've executed over the last several years is that we will be north of 20% conversion on that incremental revenue. In addition to the footprint consolidation of $12 million to $15 million tailwind, we also expect to drive significant continued operational performance in the business as well. So that would be an additional up to $30 million plus of operational improvement, and we are also planning for less incentive compensation expense in 2022. So that all will box you to the higher margin in an absolute sense. Jason Stuhldreher : Understood. And then maybe just on the free cash flow conversion, I mean the numbers that you're guiding to are pretty strong for 2022 kind of -- in that 75% range, maybe even a little higher. And I guess we're going to get an update on what sort of cash you guys can generate in your next -- in the next set of planning period. But as we think about some of the restructuring cash uses kind of rolling off and maybe sort of a normalization of working capital, is it kind of fair to hope for maybe north of 75% kind of going forward? Carl Anderson : Yes. I think obviously, we're driving to achieve the 75% for this year in 2022. And we will obviously provide an update in a couple of weeks at our Strategy Day in a little bit more detail. But the expectation, just given the improved overall balance sheet and what we expect from working capital, I think it would be a fair assumption we should be driving that number north of 75% as we go forward. Jason Stuhldreher : Understood. Okay. Then lots to talk about on the electrification front, but I'll save that for next month. So thanks, team. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherif El-Sabbahy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Sherif El-Sabbahy: So I just wanted to ask about the 140 basis point impact on aftermarket and industrial. It seems like freight is having an outsized impact on that segment. Could you provide a bit more color? And then when would you expect that freight impact to maybe roll off? Carl Anderson : Yes, as we're seeing -- as we look at kind of just global freight index since -- just in the fourth quarter alone. So this is -- if I go back to when we last talked to you back in July and where we are now, we have seen freight costs increase 50% since that time period. So I think that continues to be a near-term short-term headwind in the business. But as we kind of go forward, there are actions that we addressed in the call, especially with the aftermarket business around pricing that we expect to go into effect in the -- our second quarter. So you should start seeing that normalize a little bit further as we get out of this first quarter. Sherif El-Sabbahy: Understood. And then with regards to the Commercial Truck segment, has it seen a similar level? Or is there pass-throughs or something of that nature there that would be offsetting a bit more that isn't present in aftermarket? Carl Anderson : No, it is affecting both segments, we are seeing that. Obviously, we have pass-through mechanisms on our steel, we do not have that in freight. So that is something that we have to -- have further discussions with our customers on for pricing. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Carl, if I look at some of the factors for the margin walk in '22 and revenue conversion and operating performance. If I just sort of use sort of normal historical incremental margins on the revenue you're showing, it would seem like maybe half of that 1.4 to 2.2 is from volume and the other half would be more operational performance. And I know you sort of called out the $12 million to $15 million from actions taken, but what are some of the other areas there where you can sort of drive further operational performance in '22? Carl Anderson : Joe, yes, I think there a couple of other areas in addition to footprint, as I mentioned earlier, would be we are expecting lower incentive compensation. So that was a -- so call that in around that $10 million type of range year-over-year. And then additionally, our expectation is we will continue to drive significant material performance into the business on a year-over-year basis. So I think those are kind of the key drivers for us to -- for that bridge. Joseph Spak : Okay. I guess staying there, and you sort of just touched on this a little bit like the recovery in pricing actions. So it sounds to me like that's a mix of contractual stuff and sort of negotiation, can you just help us sort of understand the split there in terms of sort of what is more just contractual that sort of owed to you? And how much is you guys rolling up your sleeves at the table and sort of trying to get some pricing back and what the reaction to those conversations have been so far? Chris Villavarayan : So I'll take that one. And just if you break it up, steel is mostly contractual. So we have that on average somewhere between 75% to 80% as passed through. There's obviously the lag associated with when we have that recovery. Most of the conversations are most -- are on the freight side, as Carl mentioned, that is something that is not covered. And so those negotiations, as you could imagine, are obviously difficult, but our customers understand it, especially when you think about numbers where freight has gone up 400% to 500% depending on which region and the type of freight. So we've had those -- we've started those conversations early. We've continued to have those conversations, though difficult. What I would say, Joe, is at the end of the day, our customers need us healthy. So we've been able to work with them. And as we see going into '22, those costs continue to rise. So we will have to continue to have those conversations. Joseph Spak : And historically, it's been easier to take pricing on the aftermarket side, right, than on the correct? Chris Villavarayan : Yes, correct. We twice the year and we've usually... Joseph Spak : Yes. Okay. Last one for me. Like on the EV stuff, great to hear $500 million in wins, which is, I think, what you were already, which is what you're targeting. Is there a way to let us know the split between, let's call them, legacy truck makers and some of these newer names? And also like what's the time frame for that $500 million to be recognized over? Chris Villavarayan : So let me take that one. We don't usually provide the granularity by customer, Joe. What we're doing is essentially taking the full basket or the full revenue that we have from all our customers and risk adjusting, and that's what you see. However, in terms of, let's call it, timing, that's something that we will provide when you call in on December 7. Operator : Our next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Matthew Milask : This is Matt on for Bruce. Congratulations on the solid fiscal '21. With regards to the fiscal '22 outlook, could you provide some more color around the key assumptions on labor cost inflation perhaps how good you guys feel about your line of sight into how the salary, wages and benefit line might ultimately impact margins next year? And maybe as a follow-up to that, if you could comment on the hiring and staffing challenges that you're experiencing now in the market, if you have any thoughts on what the impact might be on production, labor and so forth from The Biden Administration's vaccine regulations? Carl Anderson : Thanks, Matt. I'll take the first question and turn it over to Chris for the second. As it relates to the inflation for the workforce that we're seeing, it is embedded in our guidance right now. I think it is definitely obviously increasing depending on where we're operating and what we're in, but I would say it's fully reflected in what our guidance is from an assumption perspective. So I'll turn it over to Chris. Chris Villavarayan : And so on the second half, Matt, if you think about it, I would say Q4 for us was probably one of our most challenging quarters thinking about labor coming with the -- obviously, the impact of the Delta variant as well as the inability to really get a good view of the line rates because of the impacts of the semiconductor shortages. So we were seeing quite a bit of sporadic shutdowns through Q4. We do see that normalizing in Q1. So our OEs have adjusted line rates based more from the visibility they have ahead of them, and that's provided us the ability to then appropriately staff. One of the other things we have done and it's a true testament of the Meritor the employees of Meritor is we were able to respond, in many cases, by moving some of our salaried folks to respond into the plants. And as we think through some of our strategies at least stabilizing through the next quarter, those are some of the, let's call it, the elements that we continue to deploy. Matthew Milask : And lastly, if I could sneak one more in. Could you provide any updates on the Blue Horizon platform? Perhaps some color around the planned product portfolio, production time line, maybe the order book with existing customers or any new customer activity would be great. Chris Villavarayan : Yes, I'd love to. So perfect. So I think Blue Horizon -- under Blue Horizon, we captured both our ePowertrain as well as, let's call it, the full system with the full system, which is where we provide the PACCAR, the battery system as well as the ePowertrain, which we're launching with PACCAR, we're all aligned to go into production at the end of this year. So we're in great shape there. And then with the which is -- 14Xe, which is the ePowertrain, we announced obviously the two prototype announcements today. So that stream continues to build, and we look forward to talking more about it on our Strategy Day on the 7. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Given that you're mostly protected in customer agreements with regard to steel cost recoveries with the biggest consideration there, I think being mostly timing differences and the optics on margin, et cetera. I thought to ask some more questions on these non-commodity supply chain costs. A number of light vehicle suppliers this quarter have called out these costs, including ocean shipping, freight, electricity, natural gas, diesel, even labor, suggesting that they are unusual and that they would seek to at least partially recover them via commercial negotiations with their customers. I heard you guys mention ocean shipping and freight a number of times. To what extent should we think about these costs as needing to be offset more through productivity and other cost savings? Is that how you've tended to handle lower rates of inflation of these costs in the past versus to what extent do you expect to pass on higher non-commodity supply chain cost to customers? If you do intend to pass along those costs, what would that process or timing of that process look like? And does it make sense to potentially formalize into future agreements, I mean not labor, but certainly maybe ocean shipping, for example, in the way that commodities began to be formalized in the contracts in the 2000s? Chris Villavarayan : Well, it's a great question, Ryan. I think when you think about the size and scale it isn't something that we can truly absorb when we think about the business. I mean you come to a point where it becomes detrimental over time. So for us, the -- conceptually, when you look at the other elements and you've identified them well, whether it's power and portions of labor, we certainly will be looking to pass some of these on to our customers. We've started with freight because that was the most significant discussion we've had, but we certainly have had other baskets we've started discussing with our customers. As we look at the last year and just preparing for the next year, you know that a significant portion of this needs to be moved out of the business. We started early coming into the pandemic by reacting -- by adjusting our headcount as well as looking at all nondiscretionary costs. So we've done quite a bit of, let's call it, internal work. But when it comes to a point where you have increases of 200% to 500%, we certainly will be looking to have conversations with our customers. Ryan Brinkman : And then my last question is on the labor front. You did get a question there already, so I'll try to ask it from a bit of a different angle. In the past, mostly in the industry downturns, I think you have highlighted the relatively higher percent of your workers that are temporary or were temporary at the time with the implication being that maybe there could be more easily or cost effectively let go when not needed, which is seemingly the opposite of the situation today, right? So I'm just curious what your mix of permanent versus temporary workers looks like today. If you're thinking any differently about permanent versus temporary with the benefit of temporary maybe being as much as sort of greater in downturns than upturns. And generally, what your retention looks like at the moment, you did get the question of how labor costs might track going forward. But just how about ensuring that you have sufficient continuity of experienced employees to meet quality and productivity goals, et cetera. Chris Villavarayan : So when it comes to -- so I'll break the question into two parts. When it comes to our full-time employees, I would say that retention has been still quite good. And it's -- part of it, Ryan, is the, let's call it, the legacy of Meritor's 110 years of Rockwell heritage. And on average, when I look through our facilities, we have employees somewhere in that 14 to 17 years that are full time. So we've been -- we've done a great job in retaining those employees, and those employees based on the brand and the fact that they've worked with the same team and the same company have provided that level of loyalty, and we've seen very little issues on the retention side there. Specific to the temp side, the temp ratio is lower than what we have had previously. And that is, as you could imagine, the same pressures that we're experiencing in -- that the industry is experiencing. So we are -- the way we've been attempting to fix that is by, obviously, bringing down our temp ratio, and that's how we've addressed that. Overall, our full time, let's call it, retention is up running north of 96%. Ryan Brinkman : And if just sneak a couple more in on capacity, where do you stand on capacity with all these new electrification awards? I don't know how intensive they are in terms of number of employees or square footage or whatnot, but it does seem like some of these awards might be incremental to existing business. Do you have sufficient capacity to the electrification wins that you've been securing or might you need to add capacity when was the last time that you've done something like that? Carl Anderson : So we've actually broken up -- I'll break that into two elements. So the full powertrain where we build the PACCAR, the battery system and the axle, there, we have -- that is through our acquisition in TransPower. We have two buildings, and we're constantly looking at expanding our capacity there as we see that business growing. When it comes to our ePowertrain just the axle -- the integrated axle, here, what we are doing -- we have been able to integrate it into our manufacturing sites in North Carolina between Asheville and Forest City. So here, we feel that we have enough capacity to be able to respond to the market as we see it over the next few years. Ryan Brinkman : And then just finally, there's so much excitement right now about last-mile delivery vans, the leverage to e-commerce, think about bright drop and some of their competitors. To what extent are Ford transit or sprinter van considered to be in the Class 5 through 7 or how positioned are you or aren't you to compete in the light commercial vehicle space? What's your interest in that portion of commercial vehicles? Carl Anderson : Well, that's a great question. I'd love to answer that one. So when you take out -- so when you think about it, we have historically been on the heavy side. And so we started off with the 14Xe. And so if you think about Lion highly on Autocar, PACCAR, that's been the 14Xe. But the best part about our, let's call it, [indiscernible] into electrification is the wins on the medium-duty side. And so as you guys know, historically, we have had about 15% share here, and we've been winning here. So as we think about Class 7, Class 6, this is Volta, which is Hexagon, and that's where we see significant growth. And it's just been a true testament to the product that we've brought to the market right now. So we have the 14Xe that comes to Class 7 or the bottom end -- the top end of medium duty or the bottom end of heavy. And so that's what both Volta and Hexagon are using. And beyond that, we have the 12Xe that we plan to bring to the market in '23 as well as our agreement with Electric, which helps us get us into, let's call it, the top end of Class 5, Class 6 and 7. So it's not that we decided on, let's call it, a sequential strategy. We came up with parallel strategies on the medium side, and it's great to see that we're winning. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Just two follow-up financial questions for me. First, can you just touch upon what you're assuming for R&D in fiscal 2022? And then second, going back to the recovery and pricing actions, particularly for the noncontractual freight portion, how do you go about kind of modeling that? Is there sort of a percent success rate or recovery that you're assuming, just given that there might be a bit of a, I guess, an uncertain nature in terms of how those discussions may go? Chris Villavarayan : Sure. Yes, I think on R&D, we are currently assuming about 2% R&D as a percent of sales is kind of what's in the modeling and the forecast embedded in our guidance. And then as it relates to just those discussions, whether it's freight, steel, in some cases as well because we don't always recover 100%, I think it's just -- we do build certain assumptions in there. But I would say what's happening is the pricing continues to change, and we're still seeing that kind of run up. And so those discussions are just extremely critical for us. And so at this point, we will be driving to achieve everything from all customers as it relates to the pricing actions that we need to deliver on as we go forward. And we've had some success to date. But in this rising inflationary environment, especially on some of these costs, they continue to run. So there's more work and discussions we need to have. Itay Michaeli : Maybe a quick follow-up, Carl. I think you mentioned working capital obviously a drag with all that's been going on in the supply chain. Are you assuming a full recovery in fiscal '22? Or will there still be some additional recoveries beyond '22 just for all the recent volatility? Carl Anderson : Yes. As we look at it, we -- as I mentioned, we had about a $70 million headwind in '21 compared to 2020 expectations. I don't know if we'll claw all the way back, but I would say we should definitely see a $50 million-plus improvement in working capital on a year-over-year basis. Operator : Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks. Todd Chirillo : Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Chris Villavarayan : Good morning. Carl and I look forward to walking you through an excellent first quarter. Before I begin, I want to thank the exceptional Meritor team for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 3. Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance and are off to a good start for the year. We demonstrated our ability to manage the business well through a challenging set of factors on higher sales driven by stronger demand in most of our end global markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80, an increase of more than 35% year-over-year. We\u2019re working closely with our customers and suppliers to offset historically high freight and material costs while managing supply chain constraint and a prolonged labor shortage. We\u2019re navigating these headwinds and are confident in our full year outlook that we\u2019re reaffirming today. In December, we introduced aggressive M2025 targets that include growing $500 million in revenue above market, with one half coming from electrification and expanding margins to 13% while generating $600 million in free cash flow. M2025 represents Meritor fourth M plan, our execution of these plans have transformed the company since the introduction of M2016, we have increased adjusted earnings per share by more than $2 through fiscal 2021 and expect to further increase EPS by almost an additional dollar this fiscal year. We have also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 350 basis points. We had a very successful first quarter in terms of finalizing New Business Awards, some of which we announced at Investor Day. Let me briefly recap the significance of these. We have an exclusive agreement with Thomas Built Bus for Meritor\u2019s electric powertrain with SOP plan for 2024. With the electric school bus market expected to be one of the fastest adopting segments in large part due to the infrastructure bill, this agreement represents a meaningful near term opportunity to accelerate our electrification journey and expand our long term relationship with Daimler Trucks, North America. We extended our multiyear agreement with PACCAR to supply electric powertrain and full electric solutions for Kenworth and Peterbilt tractors and Refuse trucks. And we added three new prototype collaborations in the quarter with two different customers, two hydrogen fuel cell applications for Hexagon and a road sweeper platform for Electra. This makes the fifth quarter in a row that we have announced new electrification wins. In our core business, we\u2019re excited to significantly increase our on-highway presence in China. With this five year agreement, we will supply Daimler with rear axles for the Actros. We also have a new business win with one of our largest trailer customers. This is our first five year agreement with Wabash and is valued at more than $150 million. You can see on slide 4 that Meritor is differentiating itself in the industry. We believe our growing number of electrification awards is the true measure of the value our customers place on our integration capabilities and electric powertrain. In fact, our electrification revenue forecast for fiscal 2022 has increased by more than 30% since December. Slide 5 brings into focus all our electrification programs announced to-date. I want to make three important points with this slide. First, half of our production programs are in the medium-duty with accelerated adoption rate expected in this segment, we anticipate that volumes on these programs will grow faster than on the heavy side, which is all growth for us. Second, we\u2019re either exclusive or standard position on all these programs. And finally, we have eight production contracts, three with large OEMs and the remainder with promising startups. We look forward to helping more customers drive to a cleaner world.  On slide 6, I want to emphasize the importance of the work we\u2019re doing at our innovation complex in Escondido, California. With the technical expertise inherent in this operation we can offer a complete turnkey vehicle electric vehicle solution. In addition to the electric powertrain, Meritor can provide the PCAS or power controls and accessory subsystem. Our acquisition of TransPower gave us a wealth of experience in vehicle controls that we have strengthened since taking ownership in 2020. We\u2019re proud to be production ready for our electric powertrain and the full electric system. We\u2019re confident in our capabilities and in the important role Meritor will play as commercial vehicles transform over the next decade. This is an incredibly exciting time for us. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Carl. Carl Anderson : Thanks, Chris and good morning. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll review our first quarter financial results and outlook for fiscal year 2022. Overall, we delivered excellent financial performance to begin the final year of our M2022 plan. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80. Now let\u2019s review the details of our financial results on slide 7. Overall, revenue came in at $984 million, up 11% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most markets as orders remain elevated around the globe. Net income from continuing operations was $54 million compared to $32 million last year. Higher net income was driven by increased sales volumes and lower interest expense, partially offset by net fuel costs. We also benefited from a $6 million settlement with an insurance carrier related to our asbestos liability this quarter. On a comparative basis, you will recall last year we recognize a $6 million onetime gain from our joint venture in Brazil, relating to a value added tax credit. Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. The growth in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher sales volumes partially offset by net steel costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.80, up $0.21 from last year. And finally, free cash flow for the quarter was the use of $39 million compared to $34 million of cash generated last year. The decrease was in line with our expectations as we built higher inventory levels to support an anticipated strong production environment throughout the year. Additionally, incentive compensation payments were higher this year. Now I will discuss our segment results for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck were $785 million, up nearly 14% year-over-year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most global market. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $69 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.8% a slight decrease of 30 basis points from a year ago. Higher sales partially offset by net fuel costs drove an increase to adjusted EBITDA. However, adjusted EBITDA margin was lower as net sale costs impacted sales conversion. Aftermarket industrial sales were $241 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year. Pricing actions executed over the last year in the segment was the primary driver of the improvement in revenue. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3 million to $38 million, and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 15.8%. The expansion in segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily from the footprint optimization initiatives implemented after the first quarter last year.  Now let\u2019s review our global production outlook on slide 8. As we saw last quarter demand remained strong across our markets. In the North American Class 8 market the backlog is estimated at approximately 260,000 trucks representing nearly a full year of industry production. While we are closely monitoring constraints in the global supply chain, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization. We are expecting supply chains to continue to improve as we progress throughout the year. As a result, we are not seeing a significant change from our November view. Therefore, we are maintaining our global production forecast for all markets.  Let\u2019s turn to slide 9 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Based on first quarter results and our expectations for the rest of the year we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance across all of our metrics. We expect revenue to be in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion based on our unchanged global market assumptions. Additionally, our expectations for adjusted EBITDA margin remains between 11.5% to 12.5%. We continue to plan for pricing actions to help mitigate steel, freight and labor cost pressures. We expect these recoveries to be more fully realized as we progress through the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations remain in a range of $3.25 to $3.75. And finally, our free cash flow guidance is also unchanged with a projected range of $175 million to $200 million. Our first quarter results provide a great foundation for a successful final year of M2022. We remain focused on executing this plan while simultaneously gearing up for M2025. As we approach the start of this new plan, we are forging a path with the coming electrification of the commercial vehicle industry. The road ahead is blue. Now we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sherif El-Sabbahy from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Sherif El-Sabbahy: So first off, congratulations, a great quarter. On the commercial truck margins, the first quarter saw some headwinds from steel. Looking at similar incremental data suggests deals around the $10 million to $11 million headwind to EBITDA. Is that correct? And then how would you see the cadence of those headwinds playing out quarter to quarter throughout the year? CarlAnderson: Yes, thanks Sherif. Yes, for the entire quarter steel was actually about a $24 million net headwind for us with the vast majority of that close to $20 million really affecting the commercial truck segment. And as we look forward, we think steel will continue to be a headwind for the rest of this year. But the next big step of that probably will be in the second quarter. And then as we look forward for the second half, we do believe, based off the trend line we\u2019re seeing in steel prices that we\u2019ll start seeing that the impact really starts to decline as we get in the second half. Sherif El-Sabbahy: Makes sense. And then last quarter, you mentioned it was a very difficult quarter with the sporadic shutdowns from semis and limited visibility. And you expected that to normalize in the first quarter. So have you seen sort of a normalization of those lingering shortages and do you have better visibility based on OEM setting their line rates? Carl Anderson : Yes, Sharif, I\u2019ll take that one. For sure, I mean, based on I think where we\u2019re seeing demand, the supply chain has improved from Q4 to Q1, but to your point that\u2019s not resolved. And I would say, certainly, as we see from Q1 to Q2 we do see more stabilization. And it\u2019s probably too early to declare a victory. And you do see over time this continuing to improve. But at this point, we certainly do see an improvement, both from a supply chain standpoint, and let\u2019s call it more from our customers. Customers getting far more comfortable with their ability to get chips or understand their chip supply and also forecast better. As you can also see with PACCAR\u2019s announcement, and taking the number of offline trucks, they\u2019re obviously starting to get more chips in the system. So we do see that improving but again, probably too early to declare victory. Sherif El-Sabbahy: And just one final one, with the PACCAR partnership expansion you announced last evening. How long is that multi, I know, it\u2019s a multiyear. Are you disclosing how long that relationship lasts? And then, with regards to the integration and software aspect of that relationship how sticky do you see that being longer term as EV adoption expands and the partnership evolves? Chris Villavarayan : Well, Sherif. Thanks. That\u2019s a great question that I\u2019d love to talk to. So in terms of the relationship that we announced, it\u2019s through 2025. But just to put it in perspective across the two platforms on the day cab, and the waste trucks where we\u2019re releasing six platforms and to just put it in perspective, that\u2019s about somewhere between 1,500 to 1800 components across the power electronics. So the PCAS, the battery management system, as well as the ePowertrain, so in total between the two teams, we brought 10,000 parts to production in a period of 18 months to 24 months, and it\u2019s PACCAR saw how complex that process was and obviously was an integral part of working with that. And that integration ties software between obviously the PCAS, the battery system, the powertrain, but also their truck, and all the validation that\u2019s gone through that, and we put this into production in December. So certainly, they\u2019ve seen the value that we\u2019ve brought to the marketplace with them, and provided as an extension, and it\u2019s truly a validation of the value of the Meritor proposition. So we\u2019re very proud of it. Sherif El-Sabbahy: Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it along. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from a line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joseph Spak : Thanks. I guess my first question is, is really sort of bigger picture here. If we go back to your capital markets say, if I made a point of talking about additional system design on electrification including more software features, and I think you\u2019re getting highlighted that today on the full design system, on the full system design side. I guess what I\u2019m curious about is how much you\u2019re going to need to spend to hire the right people and how, and your ability to attract those individuals because clearly there is, I think there\u2019s a limited set of people with the skill set, and you\u2019re competing against, in some cases, your customers in some cases other end markets like electrification, etc, and in some cases, just for even other industries. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about that and sort of how you see the cost related to that over the coming years and also your ability to get the right people you need to, to execute on that plan? Chris Villavarayan : Well, I think probably a good perspective to start on this Joe, is, is probably off our slide 5, and if look at the fact that we have eight production contracts, half of them coming from the medium duty space and half of them coming from the heavy space. It probably is a good starting point that the customer certainly believe that we have the right building blocks in place. So then going to that slide that the following slide on slide 6 that walks through what did we do across both those spaces. So let me take a minute and walk you through on the full system. So on the full system, as we did in the capital market space we talked a meeting, we talked across the three segments that were approaching this. So when we think about heavy, which is core to Meritor, we invested in TransPower. We acquired it and we used it as the building blocks to not only give us the access to test our product, but also work with customers such as PACCAR to drive that system and bring it to production. And for us to have been able to done that, to do that the number of folks that we have already put in place in Escondido as well as in Detroit seems to have certainly supported that. And it\u2019s certainly working for us. So on that side, I believe that we have the right building block to go approach that. On the transit space and the medium duty space, if you notice, we made announcements with BAE to help us on the transit space. And we made announcements with C-Electric to help us with the full system as we focused more on the powertrain. So that\u2019s how we focused on how we want to approach the full system capability as well as working with our customers some of which obviously have that system. And on the e-powertrain, we certainly believe again, that we have the right building blocks more because of the wins across all of them. We\u2019ve announced 14 wins on this side on our motors and inverters. We work with Danfoss, which we believe is a strong partner who obviously has scales on motors. And then we are putting inverter capability internally as well as working with external parties. And again, as this evolves, we will continue to look at M&A. But at this point, based on the validation that we\u2019re getting from the customers, we believe we have the right building blocks. Joseph Spak : But I guess just maybe in building those building blocks or in retaining some of those sort of the talent for those building blocks like, is that proving to be costly? Or how do you think about that sort of on a go forward basis, because they get especially starting to try to get more into some of the software it seems like that there could be sort of an incremental cost to your business. And I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s not a return on that. But like, it seems like the cost has to come before the return? Chris Villavarayan : And maybe I\u2019ll split that up into parts. Joe. I\u2019ll answer the question on in terms of finding the talent and retaining the talent, and maybe Carl can pick up what\u2019s the cost of it, but in terms of certainly finding the talent and returning the talent part of it is being in Detroit, we certainly have been successful in finding that talent. Our approach with how we acquire TransPower certainly gave us a baseline of folks. And so we were able to build off that. So to this point, we don\u2019t seem to have struggled with finding people. In fact, we continue to add and grow in this area. And talking to my CTO, he certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be having struggles just this yet, but in terms of costs. Carl Anderson : Yes, Joe as mentioned in the strategy day if I look forward from an R&D perspective, we are looking at increasing that quite substantially probably close to 30%, from what our current run rate has been. But I think the other planning assumption and how we\u2019re running the companies, we are looking at pivoting some of our expense and costs we are that we support the traditional business into what we\u2019re doing on electrification. So I think it\u2019s all embedded in our planning assumptions as we look to drive the M2025. So that you\u2019re absolutely right, you\u2019ll see that cost increase as relates to all the efforts we\u2019re doing there, but we\u2019re also doing a lot where we\u2019ll be reducing some of the costs on our traditional products as well. Joseph Spak : Thanks Carl and then just more near term, I guess. Can you sort of update us on steel costs and recoveries for the balance of the year? We\u2019ve obviously seen at least spots deals sort of come off the highs here. But I know there can be sort of lags in both directions in terms of sort of outflows for your business. So how are you sort of thinking about steel cost and recoveries for the balance of the year? I know, you didn\u2019t sort of change your guidance, but it seems like probably spot still has sort of maybe moved versus prior. Carl Anderson : It has. So I think from a forecast perspective we were planning originally to have steel decline throughout the year when we last spoke in November. I would say that where I see spot prices today, they are coming in a little bit lower than what we originally were planning for. But from a lag perspective, obviously, steel is still a significant headwind for us this quarter as I referenced earlier. We expect that also to happen in the second quarter, and then you\u2019ll start seeing that kind of normalize, as we kind of get into the second half of our fiscal year. Joseph Spak : To be like more neutral in the back half or kind of like a year-over-year positive by the back half? Carl Anderson : It could be, it could turn into a year-over-year positive depending on where the spot prices kind of come to, and it does get. There\u2019s that lag effect, as you referenced before, depending on most of our contracts somewhere it\u2019s three to six months. So it depends. But yes, that would be our expectation at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan from Stifel. Your line is now open. Bruce Chan : Good morning and congrats on the results. Don\u2019t really want to feel wet blanket here, but wondering if you can maybe just give us some brief commentary on order cancellations. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not really in the picture today. But maybe you can just remind us of what kinds of deposits or contract penalties if any there are for cancellation. And how do you couch the risk of cancellations to earnings and margins when you think about the sensitivities that you\u2019ve built into that M2025 plan? Chris Villavarayan : So I think obviously maybe you\u2019re referring back to about November or December when it\u2019s, we saw a little bit of a spike, let\u2019s call it to 6% on cancellations on Class 8. But honestly when I look at it, Bruce, the demand is incredibly strong out there. I mean we got 260,000 trucks in the backlog, which is almost a year and we sit here and we look at this current market, and you wonder about the challenges, but if I go back to 2018, which was preparing for the second highest market we\u2019ve ever seen in 2019 you still had regions that were going the wrong way. So we had India going the wrong way. We saw South America kind of still coming out of the recession. But at this point, when you look at 2021, you got India bouncing back from their weakest. If I go back to South America, they\u2019re running at 150,000 trucks up from 109 in 2018/2019 timeframe. In North America if you look at between ACT and FDR, were somewhere between the 285 to 290 the midpoint being 290, our forecast is 280. And you got yet another almost 12 months in backlog. So we see enormous demand and I would say there\u2019s the silver lining is once we figured out how to resolve some of the supply chain constraints I do see more of a demand story. I think some of the elements of the cancellations was frankly OEs refloating going forward, as well as fleets just adjusting their order board, because they just can\u2019t get anything in the next three to six months. Bruce Chan : Now that\u2019s very helpful. And obviously, the portfolio as we get later into the plan is looking a little bit different. It\u2019s a little bit more diversified. So maybe towards that end and I\u2019m not sure if I missed this early in your commentary. But maybe you can give some commentary on the EV revenue backlog. I think that\u2019s something that you also mentioned during the Capital Markets Day. Is that trending any differently as we sit here in February? I know, it\u2019s only been a few months. Chris Villavarayan : Well, I\u2019ll start off, I think we had talked about $500 million or a $0.5 billion in backlog, right through to let\u2019s call it the capital markets day. I would say that, obviously, from what we see in forecasts that it\u2019s now we\u2019re significantly heading north of that. But what we did was we switched from talking about backlogs to now driving defined revenue within the years so that just to give a better perspective of how Meritor approaches things. And so that\u2019s the one where in my prepared remarks, I talked about revenue that we\u2019ve planned for 22 actually being up 30%. And our target for 2025 is $280 million, which we\u2019re as we see where the backlog is sitting, we\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re certainly seeing a path to hit that plus some as you know, we approach this pretty conservatively as Meritor. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Brian Johnson : Yes, thank you. I want to talk a little bit more about the electrification going blue angle. The first question is, can you give us any sense of the win rates on the 14Xe Axel? Second would be where different OEMs are in sourcing, obviously, the German truck companies and Daimler in particular, tend to do more both engine and axle work in house. That\u2019s question number two? And then question number three is a pushback we get from investors is, yes, you\u2019re making progress, but what about Cummins, Eaton and Allison. They are well entrenched with the same OEMs that you serve. Are they going to wake up one day and flex their muscle in this segment and does that worry you is Meritor management? Chris Villavarayan : So good morning, Brian, love to take that question. So I\u2019m going to break it into three sections. I think the first part really, in terms of the 14Xe and the success rate on the 14Xe. So again, going back to that slide 5, all of that is with the 14Xe with the exception of the MAN announced, the Volkswagen announcement that we have, that\u2019s working off what we call an echo axle that\u2019s designed to work with a remote mounted system, what with the future, being on a medium duty 12Xe. But everything that we have announced on that page is or let\u2019s call it the 14 that we\u2019re working on are all working off the 14Xe and then we\u2019re super proud of that, because it really shows that I think whether folks are building ground up which are let\u2019s call it the new entrants, such as Lion or Volta that have an option of designing whatever technology they want, or the folks that are, let\u2019s call it the, the traditional OEMs, whether it\u2019s Daimler or whether it\u2019s PACCAR or whether it\u2019s Autocar they\u2019ve picked the 14Xe. So that\u2019s, I think, the first comment. The second question in terms of vertical integration, I believe that there\u2019s so much opportunity here and that there\u2019s naturally going to be more competition. We\u2019re going to see more suppliers, more OEMs entering this space. But frankly, we face that today. I mean, if you think about Daimler in North America, they still buy 50% of their class 8 axles from us, even though they\u2019re vertically integrated. But I see the opportunity for us to grow in this space, primarily because of three reasons. The first one is, if you notice, half the wins are in the medium duty space. We only have 15% share there. So this is pure growth from that segments as we every entry that we make there. The content is three to four times more content. So with that, I mean, if you think about our axle\u2019s volume, and if you think about this transitioning, we\u2019re getting so much more in revenue and content as we transition here. And finally, in concept of vertical integration, I think the OEs whether it\u2019s Daimler, as you defined it, let\u2019s call it the European OEs they certainly see value here and with the announcement that we made, both at the strategy day or today, with Daimler they\u2019re working with us on the Thomasville school bus, which is an exclusive agreement. And it\u2019s something that they certainly have the capability on their own and they certainly picked us. So we\u2019re pretty confident that customers over time will see value. And in any case, across those three reasons, we see a path to continue to grow. Brian Johnson : And any indication that the other, we know data strategy pretty well, but the other powertrain players in the North American truck space, whether you even see them in these RFP situations? Chris Villavarayan : We do. As I mentioned, I think there are there are more competitors, but frankly, I think I look at it from what\u2019s our strengths that we bring to the marketplace. And it is really the fact that just put it in perspective Brian, we have around the world, we\u2019re the number one commercial axle provider in North America. If you think about the fact that we have a scale of 70%, 7 out of 10 that run on our product, which if you put it in perspective is 2,000, about 1,500 to 2,000 axles. So the e-power trains built off that scale. And it\u2019s frankly, we\u2019ve been designing efficiency into axles for over a century. So we believe we have that capability will help us. Now in terms of some of the other competitors you mentioned, I believe that technology is moving into our space. So whether it\u2019s the engine or their transmission that technology is moving into the axle and who better understands that for the last 100 years, but us. So I think that\u2019s why we believe we have the strength here. And we certainly see that validated with in terms of the customers. The customers are being methodical. They are testing which we obviously expect them to do. They\u2019re testing many products. Obviously there is value in some of the things that our competitors are doing. But we believe the market is so big and there\u2019s enormous opportunity here that the basket is great for all of us. Brian Johnson : Thank you and look forward to discussing this further in Florida in a couple of weeks. Chris Villavarayan : Absolutely, look forward to it too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Well, hi, good morning. This is [Indiscernible] on for Ryan. I just had one question on incremental margins. You talked about being able to offset some of the commodities and trade pressures through price. Just curious, in terms of new wage inflation, it was managed pretty well in the first quarter. But on a go forward basis given where we are with wage inflation, did you see any change in view to your incremental margins on a go forward basis? How do you manage that or flex that in the future? That\u2019s the only question. Thanks. Chris Villavarayan : Yes, we are definitely seeing wage inflation. Primarily, it\u2019s a U.S. story for us. It\u2019s obviously something that\u2019s embedded in our current forecast. And so obviously we\u2019re finding other ways to offset that as well as we think about what it means for the rest of the year. So, no change in margin, obviously, we kept everything unchanged from our guide that we had back in November. So I think it\u2019s part of its internal continuing to drive internal efficiency, as well as discussions that we\u2019re having with our customers as it relates to pricing. Unidentified Analyst : So like going forward and beyond the current year if inflation does persist, do you feel like you can continue to manage that through other areas of maybe cost reductions or your pricing? Chris Villavarayan : Yes. That is the plan. I think in addition to kind of our normal approach and strategy I think you\u2019re going to see us obviously, look to automate even further, and many in most of our facilities as well as to provide other offsets for us. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks for the color and good luck. Operator : Thank you. At this time I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks. Todd Chirillo : Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Christopher Clulow : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2022. Participating with me today are Tom Linebarger, our Executive Chairman; Jen Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the risk factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Executive Chairman, Tom Linebarger one more time. Thanks. Thomas Linebarger : Thank you, Chris. Brilliant. Good morning, everybody. I just -- I had to start by telling you about some rough math I did before I walked in today. And I believe this is my 70th earnings call. It's also going to be my last. I'm very grateful to the analysts and investors who are part of this journey with me. Many of you help me better understand the perspective of our shareholders, which influenced how we ran the company, how we developed our strategies and priorities, and how we communicated about our results and plans for the future. I always try to ensure that the senior leaders in the company understood your views and perspectives, and they understood who they were really working for. Some of you have been at this work almost as long as I have, and your commitment to understanding our company and its potential has been remarkable. I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me.  I'm very proud to have served as the CEO for this company for 10 years, as a senior executive for more than 20 years. It was an honor and a privilege. This company stands for more than its products and technology, its revenue or its earnings, and even its performance for customers all over the world. The people that work here are exceptional humans, not just exceptional workers. That's why this transition was so important to me. It is perhaps the most important work of my entire career. And I have a smile a mile wide today because of the quality of the individual that replaces me and the strength of the team beneath her. Jennifer Rumsey is a once in a generation leader. She combines the leadership and technical skills needed, with the characters and values required and the inspiration of a CEO that can take this company to places where I could not. I'm as proud as I was on the day I took the job to see her succeed me. Jen? Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Tom. Good morning. I'm excited to join you this morning in this new capacity as President and CEO for Cummins. In July, we announced that Tom would end his term as CEO effective August 1. It is a bittersweet moment for me as he's been one of the most significant influences in my career and leadership. Tom has been an incredible leader for this company and a true partner and coach to me. Because of his leadership, we are in a strong position to navigate what comes next and execute our Destination Zero strategy. Tom and I share a common vision for Cummins and the role that our company plays empowering a more prosperous world. I feel deeply honored and proud to serve as the new CEO of Cummins, the first woman and just the seventh CEO of this great company. My life and leadership have prepared me for this role at this moment during the critical period for Cummins and our planet. A focus on purpose, people and impact has shaped my career and will influence how I lead. I look forward to working with all of you as we move forward. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. And I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the detail on our performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter. The company achieved significant milestones related to 2 previously announced acquisitions : Jacobs Vehicle Systems, or JVS, and Meritor. In April, Cummins completed the acquisition of JVS, adding engine braking, cylinder deactivation, start-stop control and thermal management technologies, which are key components to meeting current and future emissions regulations. On May 26, Meritor's shareholders voted in favor of the Cummins acquisition bid, further validating the potential of what Cummins and Meritor can achieve together. The companies are working together to complete the acquisition this week as we have received all regulatory approvals to close the transaction.  During the second quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Daimler Truck, North America and Scania to deliver fuel cell electric powertrains for heavy-duty truck applications and with Komatsu on development of zero-emission haulage equipment, including hydrogen fuel cell solutions for large mining haul truck applications. Cummins, Chevron and Walmart also share plans to integrate Cummins X15N natural gas engines, powered by renewable natural gas into Walmart's heavy-duty truck fleet.  These customer collaborations are significant steps in alignment with our Destination Zero strategy to evolve our company, our products and our customers' products to the technologies needed for a decarbonized world. This strategy, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Cummins, includes reducing carbon emissions now by making improvements in engine-based solutions that are broadly available today while rapidly advancing the 0 emissions technologies of the future.  We continue to focus on our people and their development as a strategic advantage for the company. In the second quarter, the company posted its first human capital management report, detailing our commitment to creating and maintaining a dynamic and exciting work environment for our employees. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions, with the notable exception of China, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter. Revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the second quarter of 2021. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16% compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. Second quarter results included costs of $29 million related to the preparations for the separation of the Filtration business. As discussed previously, we recorded a charge of $158 million in the first quarter related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. In the second quarter, received certain inventory and other expense amounts reserved previously and incurred some small additional charges, resulting in a net recovery of $47 million. Adjusting for these items, EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the financial impact of the suspension of our Russia operations and the costs associated with the separation of our Filtration business.  EBITDA percentage declined in the second quarter as strength in sales and increased gross margin were offset by a 31% drop in joint venture income from the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in China markets. Research and development expenses also increased slightly in the second quarter of 2022 as we continued to invest in products and technologies that will create advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segment. Gross margin percentage improved compared to second quarter of 2021 as the benefit of pricing and higher volumes exceeded the manufacturing, logistics and materials cost increases during the quarter. This pricing only partially offset the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we carried through from 2021 and experienced in the first half of 2022. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 15% to $4 billion, driven by improved pricing, higher volumes and higher aftermarket demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 62,000 units, up 9% from 2021 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, up 12% from 2021. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 30,000 units in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% from the 2021 levels, while our unit sales were 27,000, up 21% from 2021. We shipped 38,000 engines to [indiscernible] for the use on the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2022, down 9% from 2021 levels due to supply chain issues, which temporarily limited truck production. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 9% as other companies maintained strong capital spending.  Power Systems North America sales were flat compared to 2021 as strength in aftermarket offset lower volumes. Demand remains high in North America markets for Power Systems, but revenues for North America power generation declined by 3% as supply chain constraints limited our production for both U.S. military and mobile power applications. Our international revenues decreased by 2% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 43% due to lower sales in the on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 173,000 units, a decrease of 70% from 2021. Last year's numbers were strong, supported by a prebuy ahead of NS VI. But weaker new vehicle demand and economic impacts from shutdowns as the country is responding to a COVID-19 resurgence have pushed the market to the lowest level since 2007.  Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 25,000, a decrease of 70% despite the very difficult environment in China. We did see growth in some of our power systems markets, particularly mining and oil and gas. The light-duty market in China decreased 38% from 2021 levels to 380,000 units. While our units sold, including joint ventures, were 23,000, a decrease of 40%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 66,000 units, a decrease of 32% from 2021 levels. The decrease was driven by declining demand within the property market and the COVID-19 impact on infrastructure demand. Our units sold were 9,900 units, a decrease of 41%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 5% in the second quarter due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were a record $594 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 131%, while our shipments increased 78%, lagging the industry production due to lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. The high level of growth in the second quarter is coming off a very low base when India was experiencing a COVID-19 peak in 2021. Demand for power generation and construction equipment increased in the second quarter as economic activity continued to improve. In Brazil, our revenue increased 7%, driven by improved demand in most end markets.  Now let me provide our outlook for 2022, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a weaker market outlook in China as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 250,000 units to 260,000 units in 2022, a 10% to 15% increase over a year ago. The supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are now projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021, an update to our previous guidance down 5%. In China, we are now projecting total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 20% to 25% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 10%. We now project a 50% reduction in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market compared to a 40% decline and a 12% reduction, respectively, in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021, consistent with our prior guidance. Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China, we have significantly improved our presence and profitability in the region compared to private -- prior cycles and are well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in the region. As an illustration from 2019 to 2022, the demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks is projected to be down 40%, while across the same period, we are forecasting an increase in earnings from joint ventures in China.  As we look ahead, industry volume of NF VI product will increase through 2022 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to continue to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase 15% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 10%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022.  We continue to project most major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2022. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat in 2022 compared to the prior year, consistent with previous guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120%, an update from our previous guidance of up 95%. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets have fueled this improved outlook.  Revenue in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction, consistent with our prior guidance. We are now projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021, an improvement from our previous estimate of up 15%. This is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business as well as global Power Systems markets. In New Power, we continue to expect full year sales to be approximately $200 million. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers, which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with OEMs on both electrified power and fuel cells for applications in 2022 as highlighted by the announcements I noted previously.  We are maintaining our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance of approximately 15.5%, excluding the impacts of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business and the expected costs associated with the pending acquisition of Meritor. We expect to deliver the strong profitability despite the supply chain constraints and rising inflationary costs that we are experiencing. During the quarter, we returned $240 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. Strong execution resulted in record sales in the quarter despite very difficult operating environment. The ongoing supply chain constraints and rising costs throughout the industry, continued COVID-19-related impacts and the effect of the conflict in Ukraine all present challenges to operating our business.  I am grateful for the commitment of our employees across the organization who have worked tirelessly to overcome these challenges. Their efforts resulted in a strong quarter, enabling us to support our customers while generating solid returns. Cummins is in an excellent position to continue to execute our Destination Zero strategy, invest in the products and technologies that will fund future growth and drive advantage for our customers. We will accomplish this while generating strong financial results and meeting our commitment to return cash to shareholders. It's an exciting time to become CEO.  Thank you for joining us today. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter, especially in the context of a challenging global business environment. As Jen mentioned, our second quarter results included a $47 million benefit from adjusting the reserves related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business.  To provide clarity on operational performance, I'm going to exclude the impact of these items in my comments. We have provided a breakdown of the costs associated with Russia and the filtration separation costs by line item and by segment in our earnings material to help you understand the underlying performance more clearly. Now let me go into more details on the second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues of $6.6 billion were up 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 15%, while international revenues declined by 2% due to a sharp slowdown in China. Foreign currency fluctuations, primarily a stronger U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales for the quarter compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by negative other income and lower joint venture earnings in China. Gross margins improved year-over-year and from the first quarter.  Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 25.6% of sales increased by $208 million or 140 basis points. The benefits of stronger volumes and higher pricing more than offset higher freight and material costs for this quarter. Of course, we have been facing increased costs for an extended period of time. And now our gross margins have returned back to 2019 of pre-COVID levels. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $16 million or 2%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting future growth, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.  Joint venture income declined by $42 million versus a year ago. Lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China was the primary driver of the decline in earnings. Other income was a negative $18 million, $87 million worse than a year ago. We experienced $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans in the second quarter, and this compares to gains of $20 million a year ago. This variation in this one category explains most of the change in other income.  Net earnings for the quarter were $678 million or $4.77 per diluted share compared to $600 million or $4.10 from a year ago. The earnings per share increased due to higher earnings, lower taxes and a reduced share count resulting from share repurchase activity. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.3%, including $36 million or $0.25 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $599 million compared to $616 million a year ago.  I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues increased 11% from a year ago, while EBITDA decreased from 16.1% of sales to 15.2% of sales, as the benefits of stronger volumes and pricing actions in our consolidated earnings were more than offset by lower joint venture income in China. In 2022, we expect the revenues to be up 10%, up 2% from our prior guidance. The increase in sales primarily driven by higher demand for engines and parts in North America. 2022 EBITDA is projected to be approximately 14.5%, in line with our prior guidance.  In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 17% from a year ago to $2.3 billion, a record quarter for the segment. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.2% compared to 10.5% sales a year ago, primarily due to stronger parts, whole goods, and sales and pricing actions. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% year-over-year and EBITDA margins in the range of 10.5% of sales, both in line with our prior guidance.  Components segment revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter, primarily driven by weaker demand in China. EBITDA increased from 15.1% of sales to 18.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions which offset material cost increases and lower warranty expense. We expect revenues to increase 3% for the year, down from an increase of 6% in our prior guidance, primarily to a lower outlook in China. EBITDA margin is expected to be 16.75% of sales, in line with our prior guidance. In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 5% and EBITDA decreased from 12.2% to 10.6% of sales, as the benefit of stronger volumes and pricing were more than offset by higher material and logistics expenses. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 8% and EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11% for Power Systems, unchanged from our prior year guidance.  In the New Power segment, revenues were $42 million, up 75% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $80 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the products infrastructure and capabilities to support future growth and was in line with our expectations. In 2022, we still expect revenues for the New Power business to be approximately $200 million, up 72%. And net EBITDA losses are still expected to be in the range of $290 million for New Power, also unchanged from our prior guidance.  As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our '22 expectations of company revenues to be up 8% and our EBITDA margins of approximately 15.5% of sales. This guidance excludes expenses outside of the normal course of business associated with the separation of the Filtration business, the pending acquisition of Meritor or the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline 25% in 2022, excluding the impact of suspension of our business in Russia. And this is down from our prior guide of a decline of 20% due to continued weakness -- or further weakness, in fact, in the China truck market. We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5% for this year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were $147 million in the quarter, up from $125 million a year ago. We still expect that our full year capital investments will be in the range of $850 million to $900 million.  We returned $240 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the second quarter, bringing our total cash returns of $758 million for the first half of the year. We still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. While high inflation and rising global interest rates present risks to global economic growth, we did not experience any significant changes in aggregate demand from our customers over the past quarter. Our focus remains on raising financial performance cycle-over-cycle in our core business, while investing in technologies that will deliver future profitable growth, including in new markets, new applications and with new customers.  We continue to advance our strategy in the second quarter, delivered record quarterly revenues and earnings per share, and recently announced an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the 13th straight year of dividend increases.  Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris. Christopher Clulow : Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Tom and Jen, congratulations. Jennifer Rumsey : Thanks, Jerry. Jerry Revich : So Tom, over those 70 earnings calls, I just want to add some rough math, too. So the earnings power of Cummins is up about sevenfold. So congratulations to you and the team here. Thomas Linebarger : Thank you, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain environment. You folks are sending a lot more via airfreight than you do in a normal environment. I'm wondering if you could just flesh that out for us. What proportion of your shipments are now airfreight versus in a normal environment? And how should we think about, whenever demand does slow, what decremental margins might look like given the step down that we see in expedited freight in that environment? Jennifer Rumsey : Great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, we continue to experience an environment where supply chain is limiting our production in most of our markets. And as you've seen, the team here has worked really hard to navigate that and continue to deliver as much product as we can to our customers who are also experiencing issues.  Some of those issues have lessened. We continue however to experience constraints, in particular, in the electronics space, microprocessors and other electronic components. We've seen improvement in our premium freight and also are closely monitoring what's going on with the standard freight rates. So while we have some improvement off the peak, we're still running at high levels as we continue to navigate disruptions caused by a combination of supply constraints and COVID-related disruptions. Jerry Revich : I was just going to ask you if it's possible to quantify how much higher than is the normal? Mark Smith : Well, at one point, last year, we were running probably 4x the normal level of premium freight, and that's come down. It has been that we've seen sequential improvement over the last 3 or 4 quarters, but we're still running 2x to 3x kind of extra costs right now. And then you'd asked about decremental margins, Jerry, in the event there's a slowdown. What I would say to you is we have to embrace these cycles when they come. We have a very experienced team that's navigated through several of them. I'm very proud of our record of raising cycle-over-cycle performance at the peak and trough. I can't give you exact decremental margins, but know that we will adjust plan outcome to operate the wells to continue to as and when the next cycle comes. That's all I can say really at this point. Jerry Revich : Got it. And just lastly, normally, your margins tend to be down in the third quarter versus second quarter seasonally. I'm wondering given the supply chain, the dynamic that we have here, could we actually see margins flat up for you folks sequentially depending on how supply chain performs? Mark Smith : I think the biggest challenge in the second half -- well, it's baked into our guidance, is that we see a drop-off in earnings in China. We typically see about a 25% to 30% lower JV income in the second half of the year, and we're projecting that again. You've heard from some of our important customers what their trajectory looks like on the top line going into the third quarter. Yes, there's still a lot of moving parts, still a lot of challenges we're working through. We've maintained our full year guidance. We're slightly behind the EBITDA percent for the full year through the first half of the year, but we're on track, not expecting extraordinary variation, at least from what we know today. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Timothy Thein : Yes. Tom and Jen, congrats to you both. Yes. And Tom, I trust you'll be dialing into that 71st call, just so you can hear Chris read through the legal disclaimer. Thomas Linebarger : No question about it. Timothy Thein : Yes. So yes, Tom, maybe one for you, just higher level. Obviously, you've observed a number of cycles during your time. And I'm just curious, you mentioned that you guys weren't seeing anything of note. But obviously, there's a lot of broader concerns regarding the potential for either a recession is here or on our doorstep. And I'm just curious, if you have conversations with customers, what would you be alerting the team for in terms of signposts or indications of -- if that begins to, in fact, come through, where would you be watching? And what kind of, again, signals would you be kind of leading the team for? Thomas Linebarger : Thanks, Tim. And I have been through a lot of these, and this is an unusual one, there's no question about it. But I'm going to flip it back to Jen just because in terms of conversations with customers about where they are, Jen's actually been doing more of those than I have. But I would say that -- I just kind of repeat the point Mark made. It is an unusual period and it has been an unusual cycle. And I think our team has continued to figure out ways to adapt to it, and I think we will here too. But make no mistake, a lot of us in the industry are trying to figure things out that we haven't faced before, labor shortages, part shortages over extended periods and things like that, I think you've heard from Jen. But let me just turn it back to her for kind of your perspective, Jen, of the customers and what they're looking at. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Great, great. Thanks, Tom. As Mark and Tom have said, we're in a cyclical business. We have a strong team that understands how to navigate and manage over the cycles and use the cycles to strengthen the business and emerge stronger. And this is not a typical cycle because, coming out of the COVID-19 -- early part of COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen really strong demand that has been constrained by supply chain constraints across the industry. And we have been unable to meet our collective customer demand in these markets outside of China. That have been strong now for 18 months. You see that showing up in very high aftermarket demand as well as customers have been using these products heavily and had higher parts demand as they worked to keep them running.  So despite the fact that we do see some decrease in spot rates, some reduction off of really high indicators, when I talk to customers and look at some of these backlogs and freight activity, it's still very strong. And they still would like us to supply more than we're able to. So the conversations are all focused on where are we at with supply constraints and can we ship more to them. We continue to monitor those overall indicators. At this point, end customer demand is strong. Aftermarket demand is strong. Used truck prices continue to be elevated. And also recall, with higher fuel prices, these more fuel-efficient, next-generation products are attractive to customers. And so we'll continue to stay close to it and monitor what happens. But right now, we see supply being the constraint through this year outside of China. Operator : Our next question is with Jamie Cook with Credit Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Congrats, Jennifer. And congrats, Tom, and thank you for all the support throughout the years. I wish you well. And I'm sure you're going to miss all our very insightful questions on earnings calls. I guess, Jennifer, my first question for you, understanding that you and Tom have been working closely together, and you co the Destination Zero strategy. You both obviously worked closely with and have buy-in. But sort of every CEO puts their own sort of stamp on a company. So just sort of -- as you're thinking about leading the company, sort of maybe nuances or differences relative to Tom or how you're thinking about the company just slightly differently? And then I guess just my second question, and I'll -- Jennifer, this is for you or for Mark. It's probably unfair, but I'll ask it anyway. Understanding you can't control a downturn if we have one, but I feel like Cummins' downturn theoretically in 2023 could be different as you think about, one, we have -- we're adding Meritor, you have market share wins. I guess we won't have the Filtration business. And maybe China is actually okay in this downturn because we're still -- the markets are depressed. So any way you want to sort of put buckets around how that could be additive to a normal downturn? Sorry for an unfair first question, Jennifer. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Jamie. Appreciate the question. And as you noted, Tom and I have developed the Destination Zero strategy together. I've been a member of the Cummins leadership team now for more than 7 years as Chief Technical Officer, leading the Components business, Chief Operating Officer, and now CEO. So the strategy, the focus of the company going forward remains the same. The commitment to all of our stakeholders to deliver strong results, to really create strategic advantage to our people will continue.  I think the big difference is just that, as we continue to operate in this evolving environment, paying attention to how markets are evolving, technologies are evolving, integration of Meritor, major new company, I'm going to be thinking a lot about strategic execution, and what does that mean for different parts of our business as our strategy evolves and paying attention to a more dynamic environment. And that's one of the reasons why I've kept the President role in addition to CEO is to stay close to the businesses as we focus not only on continuing to refine that strategy, but really driving strategic execution and delivering results.  As it relates to next year, we'll, of course, talk later more about next year. You've heard us say we see supply being the limiting factor through this year. Backlog is strong. China is down, and will improve, right? There's a lot of opportunity to improve. And Cummins is very well positioned. Our products are performing very well. The customer demand for that product is strong. We have new partnership opportunities in the core business and in New Power. And we'll continue to invest in products that will position the company for the future and manage through the cycles as they come. Thomas Linebarger : And by the way, I'll miss you, Jamie. Jamie Cook : No. I mean, that's fine. I was just wondering, too, I mean, the incremental market brings more opportunities and also the Meritor, some of these market share wins start to help in 2023? If you want to answer, fine, if not, that's fine. I can get back in queue. Mark Smith : I think you just described most of my work plan from Tom, we'll be working on all of those. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher : Not sure if I missed this, but what was your first half aftermarket growth? I know you raised the full year of 15% to 20% from 15%. Just kind of wondering what you're assuming for kind of the second half trajectory within that guidance if some of the market activity is kind of slowing that down at all? Christopher Clulow : Yes. Steve, it's Chris. Yes, we experienced about that same level in the first half, and we expect it to hold throughout the year. I think the demand is still very high, particularly in the heavy-duty market, in North America as well as the global Power Systems markets. Mining, oil and gas have strong demands there for aftermarket parts, rebuilds and whatnot. So we expect that to hold certainly through the remainder of 2022. Mark Smith : Yes. Q2 was a little stronger than Q1. As Tom and Jen mentioned, there have been some supply chain challenges. So these are little bit, and demand remains strong. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then as you're kind of discussing with Tim before, I mean, it seems like we're kind of in this broad macro limbo at the moment. I guess I'm just curious how that is affecting any of your investment plans or strategic actions, if that's changing the timing of anything? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Good question. So obviously, we've moved forward with our JBS acquisition and Meritor will complete this week. We're continuing to make these key investments in the future. And we are still in the process on the separation of our Filtration business as we've disclosed previously and monitoring the environment as that continues. Mark Smith : And the other thing I'd add is, we're just -- as you'd imagine, we're not just waiting around for changing economic conditions. An important part of how we've grown the earnings over time is just like a continual focus on trying to drive efficiencies in everything that we do. Doesn't always make the headlines, but almost every aspect of our work, we're looking for efficiency, better output. So we're always looking for those types of ways to improve the underlying performance of the business. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : Congrats to both of you. My question is really on New Power. There's a lot that's changed in the world in the last 6 months. Your revenue trends are pretty good. And I'm curious if you have any comments on competitive position within electrolyzers, whether you see it solidifying or expanding. You guys have the wherewithal to invest, and presumably, that pays off somehow. And then just whether the outlook into, I guess, '23, '24, I'm not sure how far along your backlog extends is inflecting upwards as the world reevaluate its energy mix? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, yes. Great question. So we did -- we delivered the highest revenue in the second quarter to date from our New Power business at $42 million and made a lot of progress across all parts of the business. So you saw announcements of new partnerships on fuel cells, both on and off-highway, where we think long term the market will move. Continuing to make progress and having lots of conversations on the electrolyzers and demonstrating the capability of our PEM electrolyzer solutions there. And we believe, as we demonstrate some of those larger installations of PEM electrolyzer, that the market's going to increasingly move towards that solution and that we're well positioned competitively. The market is lumpy at this point. And a lot of our focus is on building up capacity and scale to meet the demand. And so we will -- Amy and I will continue to be talking about what are those key milestones that we see in the market and in our scale-up activity and how that's evolving. We still feel very optimistic. And with this energy challenge that we see in the global world, expect that the focus and interest in green hydrogen will continue to grow. And lastly, with the Meritor acquisition, that's another key component that we think positions us well in the electric powertrain. And we'll be building on the business that we have and very complementary to our existing New Power business and electrified powertrain. So overall, well positioned for the future with New Power. Robert Wertheimer : That's comprehensive answer. Any inside track on whether the Inflation Reduction Act gets passed? And then you would benefit obviously from green hydrogen with that. I don't know if there's any production or any other obvious benefits that you saw in that potential bill, and I will stop there. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Great. So we're hopeful that the Inflation Reduction Act will get passed. It has many key provisions that we think are important for advancing lower carbon solutions, and it fits well with our Destination Zero strategy. It's really critical that there's investment to build out infrastructure and to make these technologies more affordable as they scale in advance. So we are -- have been active and advocating for some of the key energy provisions in that act, and we'll continue to do that as our Congress considers it. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Matthew Elkott : So after the initial COVID shutdowns in China, we saw a pretty record recovery in the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. I understand we're highly unlikely to see anything like that after the current lockdowns. But do you have any sense of how things could play out when or if China moves fully past lockdowns like most of the rest of the world has?  And a longer picture question related to China as a follow-up. You've seen some western companies, like some automakers reconsider JVs in China. Do you guys still see your JV model in China as the right strategy? Any updated thoughts on that would be appreciated. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. What happens with China COVID lockdowns is one of the big questions that we debate a lot. At this point, they continue to have this dynamic lockdown strategy. And we've continued to see some smaller scale lockdowns that have been happening and operating and kind of closed loop, closed circle environments within that from a business perspective. So I don't see when and how they completely evolve out of that. We're prepared to continue to operate in that type of environment. However, we do think that, that market is going to come back. It's a large market. It's an important market for us to be a part of because of its size. And we are committed to continuing to invest in the products and joint ventures that we have there, while also ensuring from a global supply chain perspective that we have resiliency in our supply chain so that we can navigate through COVID, weather disruptions and other constraints. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : And let me add to the congratulations here. And I just want to follow up on the IRA. So obviously, there's a lot of potential benefits for Cummins in this legislation. But among them, you could be looking at up to a $3 per kg production tax credit for green hydrogen. And obviously, it has been kind of on again, off again for the last couple of years. I have to imagine that some scenario planning has played out in some of these potential customer discussions. So at this point, is it possible to actually dimension the magnitude of the opportunities domestically that might pencil out with that kind of a PTC? And then how quickly do you think you can move to convert those opportunities to revenue if it does come to pass? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. No. It's a great question. And within that, Inflation Reduction Act, as you noted, there is incentive for hydrogen production, which is significant, as well as incentives for other clean vehicles and clean fuels. It's important to note that there's also incentive for things like biodiesel and renewable natural gas within that. So a lot of things that will help drive advantage.  We have had active conversations in recent years in Europe and growing conversations in the U.S. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill also put some significant investment in hydrogen infrastructure. And so we believe that this will continue to add to that and are really focused on scaling up our product and production to meet the demand that we think will be there. So it's hard for me to mention specifically to you right now. As I said, we'll continue to talk about what we see as the key milestones in that business, growing revenue and growing our return from the electrolyzer business over time. Noah Kaye : Okay. And maybe one quick follow-up, and there have been some discussions about preparing for a potential downturn and how you can flex down amidst that. But one variable that I'm sure you're considering is just the investment cycle for the next step-up in emissions reduction. So how do we think about that factoring into budgeting for next year, some potential increase, investment spending on the combustion side in preparing for tighter emission standards? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So you've seen us increasing our investments, in particular in both New Power and Engine business, as we invest in the technologies and electrolyzers in New Power and also these next-generation fuel-agnostic platforms and engine business. We have the scale advantage globally to do that. Those are investments that we will continue to make. And we're also looking at driving efficiency and improvement in parts of our business that can adjust with the cycle. And so we'll continue to deliver on our financial commitments and strong returns through the ups and downs as we invest in those key areas for our future. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Kauffman : And like everybody else, Tom, thank you for your leadership, and Jennifer, best of luck in the future. I wanted to focus a little bit. You discussed supply chain costs and talked a little bit about what was going on with raw material costs. If we looked at the inflationary part of cost of goods sold, how do those costs stack up against each other, in terms of how much of the increase in expense is more on the raw input side versus how much more are we spending on supply chain than we normally would? And also noting that in recent weeks and months, supply chain costs while still high have been easing, raw material costs while still high have been easing. And I'm just kind of curious, is any of that built into the guide at this point, maintaining the margins where they are? Mark Smith : Yes. Jeff, this is Mark. So I would say, this year, if you look at our costs, the material costs have been increasing. That's been the biggest single driver on the costs side. Last year, certainly the first half of the year, it was very heavy on the freight -- premium-free costs. But then we started to see more inflation in materials play out over time. So as we talked about, the premium freight costs have come down a little bit, part of that through better coordination and management of the expenses. Material costs continue to increase at this point in time. We put the -- I would say, within a fairly predictable range quarter-to-quarter so far, yes, 1 or 2 commodity costs have come off the peak, but remain at fairly elevated levels. And of course, whatever changes there are in the market, costs of freight and metal markets, those take time to work through the supply chain. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay. But Mark, back to the question though. So for the quarter, costs of goods sold was up about 5% on total revenue growth of about 8%. Ex inflationary costs, what are we looking at in terms of that raw material or the costs of goods sold inflation? I'm just trying to understand how much is kind of temporary cost inflation on materials, how much is temporary cost inflation on supply chain costs and kind of what's the underlying rate? Mark Smith : Let me put it like this. Our material cost in the second quarter increased by 1.9% of sales year-over-year, just to -- what is temporary and what's -- we're always working to make changes to products, redesign things, take costs out. But right now, that's a pretty high level over what -- certainly pre-COVID, pre this inflationary environment, that there's a high level of material cost increases. What's temporary and permanent is very hard to say. But about 1.9%, freight costs are fairly flattish year-over-year, but at a very elevated level. Material cost increase -- there are some pressure on some of the categories, but those are the biggest elements. Jeffrey Kauffman : All right. That's helpful. And then in terms of the guidance, I'm assuming no real change in either of those in terms of your outlook or has there been a change built into that outlook of margins maintaining? Mark Smith : No significant change on the costs side. We've lowered our outlook for JV earnings, which is not what you're talking about. But I'm just trying to triangulate back to the overall guidance of lower JV earnings. And we've got slightly stronger aftermarket revenues, particularly in North America, which should balance -- those balance out, but no significant changes on the other categories. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Clulow for closing remarks. Christopher Clulow : Great. Thanks, Maria. That concludes our teleconference for the day. Thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Thanks. Operator : You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions and comments following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Christopher Clulow : [Technical Difficulty]. Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs, and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the risk factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you Chris and good morning. I will start with a summary of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region, and I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.  Before getting into the details of our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the third quarter. On August 3rd, Cummins completed the acquisition of Meritor, a leading global supplier of drivetrain, mobility, braking, aftermarket and electric powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle and industrial markets. The integration of Meritor\u2019s people, products and capabilities in axle and brake technology will position Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across the internal combustion and electric power applications. We've been excited to welcome our new colleagues into our company.  The company announced several collaborations that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals and advance our destinations Euro strategy. During the third quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Werner Enterprises, Transport Enterprise Leasing and Versatile to deliver 15-liter hydrogen internal combustion engines when available. The X15H hydrogen engine, part of Cummins\u2019 fuel agnostic platform, will enable a more-timely solution to reduce carbon emissions by providing customers with an option that has powertrain installation commonality and end user familiarity. The New Power business continued to expand its green hydrogen presence globally as demand continues to rise in the key markets of North America, Europe, and China. Cummins announced it will expand PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium, factory to 1 gigawatt. The company also announced it will begin producing electrolyzers in the United States, underscoring our continued dedication to advancing the nation\u2019s green hydrogen economy. Electrolyzer production will take place at our Fridley, Minnesota facility, starting at 500 megawatts of manufacturing capacity annually and scalable to 1 gigawatt in the future. In addition we continue to make progress and preparing for the separation of our filtration business. The addition of Meritor and the planned separation of the filtration business are positive mood moves for our future. However, there are upfront costs associated with both transactions, which you can see from our press release and earnings materials, heavily influenced, our reported results this quarter. We expect that the most significant costs associated with both transactions are behind us and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the third quarter. Third quarter revenues totaled $7.3 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, third quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 11% from the same quarter in 2021. EBITDA in the third quarter was $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results and the $25 million related acquisition and integration cost, EBITDA was $907 million or 13.8% of sales compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. Third quarter results include cost of $16 million or $0.09 per diluted share related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Adjusting for these costs, EBITDA without Meritor and filtration cost was $923 million or 14% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the results of Meritor, the costs associated with its acquisition and the costs associated with the expected separation of our filtration business.  Our EBITDA percentage declined in the third quarter for three main reasons; first, we saw a 32% drop in joint venture income from the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in the China markets; second, we increased investments in research and development as we continued to invest in the products and technologies that will create competitive advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segments; and finally, we made an investment in our people, through a one-time bonus in recognition of their intense work and commitment to meet customer demand and navigate supply chain and other challenges. This bonus did not apply to company officers. A motivated and highly effective workforce is critical to delivering our customers, executing on our strategy, and creating shareholder value. And this bonus will pay dividends over time in the retention and engagement of our people. We continue to make positive progress in improving gross margins of our business and offsetting the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we have experienced since the start of 2021. Gross margin percentage improved in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2021, as the benefit of higher volumes and pricing exceeded the manufacturing, logistics, and material cost increases and higher product coverage costs during the quarter.  Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 19% to $4 billion driven by improved pricing, higher volumes, and higher after market demand. Industry production of heavy duty trucks in the third quarter was 64,000 units, up 23% from 2021 levels, while our heavy duty unit sales were 25,000, up 15% from 2021. Industry production of medium duty trucks was 29,000 units in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 26% from 2021 levels. While our unit sales were up 27,000, up 20% from 2021. We shipped 41,000 engines just to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2022, down 4% from 2021 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 16% over 2021 due to strong capital spending by rental companies and pricing. Power Systems North America sales were up 30% compared to 2021 driven by higher volumes and strength in aftermarket. Power Systems North America industrial sales were up 122% compared to the third quarter of 2021 driven by strong oil and gas demand. North America power generation sales also increased by 10% from the third quarter of 2021. Our International revenues decreased by 1% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 18% due to lower sales and on highway and construction markets. Industry demand from medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was a 164,000 units, a decrease of 25% from 2021. Weaker new vehicle demand, contracted property investment, and economic impacts from the shutdown as the country continues to respond to the COVID-19 outbreaks have pushed the market to the lowest level in a decade instead of our projected recovery of the market in the second half of the year. Our sales in units including joint ventures were 30,000 a decrease of 27%. The light duty market in China decreased 8% from 2021 levels to 387,000 units in the third quarter while our units sold including joint ventures were 24,000, a decrease of 30%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 57,000 units, an increase of 3% from 2021 levels and our units sold were 7,800 units, a decrease of 8%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 29% in the third quarter, due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $614 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 37% while our shipments increased 20%, lagging the industry production due to the lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. Demand for power generation increased in the third quarter as economic activity continued to improve, resulting in record revenue in the quarter for that market.  Now, let me provide our outlook for 2022 including some comments on individual regions and end markets. To provide clarity on our projections, we will first provide guidance excluding the results of Meritor from the acquisition date through the end of 2022. We will then provide a view of the expected Meritor results for 2022. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a continued weak market outlook in China, as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas, and power generation markets, and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021. EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15% of sales, excluding the Meritor results and costs associated with the acquisition and integration, the cost of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia and the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business. This is below our previous guidance of approximately 15.5% of sales as a result of the lower than expected market in China in the second half of 2022, and the one-time employee bonus investment made in the third quarter. This guidance reflects our expectations of increased profitability in the fourth quarter, as we continue to drive the improvements we've seen throughout the year on pricing relative to inflationary cost and improve our operating efficiency.  Based on our current forecast we expect production of heavy duty trucks in North America to be at 260,000 units in 2022, a 15% increase year-over-year. The supply chain constraints in our industry is expected to continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet the sustained strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021 consistent with prior guidance. In China we now project total revenue including joint ventures to decrease 25% to 30% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 20% to 25%. We now project a 55% reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% to 20% reduction in demand in the light duty truck market compared to a 50% decline and 15% reduction respectively in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021 consistent with our prior guidance. Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China we have continued to improve our presence in the region through the down cycle and are well positioned for continued out growth across our end markets in the region. As we look ahead industry volume of NS6 products will continue to increase as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. With our NS6 share continuing to run ahead of our NS5 share. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions, as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 15% to 20% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 15%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022. Strong performance in power generation within India is also contributing to this improved outlook.  Most major global high-horsepower markets are expected to remain strong through the end of 2022. Sales of mining engines are now expected to be up 5% compared to the prior year, an improvement from our previous guidance of flat. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120% consistent with our prior guidance. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets amid energy and security has fueled this strong outlook. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10%, driven by increases in non-residential construction. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 5% driven by the increased production as supply chain constraint slightly eased and improved pricing. We are projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021 consistent with our previous estimate. This strong outlook is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business, as well as global Power Systems markets. In New Power we expect full year sales to be approximately $180 million down from our previous guidance of $200 million due to customer scheduling and supply chain impacts. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months and we are seeing increased momentum in North America following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with customers on both electrified power and fuel cell applications in 2022. This was demonstrated in the third quarter as we successfully launched the Cummins HD 120 fuel cell system in China by delivering 52 units to the Lin-gang Government for a bus application. For Meritor, we are expecting full year revenue since the date of acquisition to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 4.5% of sales during the same period, including the impact of required purchase accounting and integration costs. This represents the financial impact of Meritor across our Components and New Power businesses. During the quarter, we returned $245 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. As I sum up the third quarter, I want to emphasize that we are making progress in our strategy to lead in decarbonizing our industry. Although profitability dropped from the second quarter levels, the fundamentals of our business have not changed. Our products are performing well, leading to record demand from customers and rising market share in some of our core markets. This is the direct result of the contribution from our outstanding workforce. I do want to acknowledge the clear improvement in the financial performance of the Power Systems business this quarter, and I'm enthusiastic about the prospects for future earnings growth. We do expect total company profitability to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels, as implied in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are committed to improving the underlying financial performance of our business and delivering strong incremental margins through the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen and good morning everyone. There were a number of factors that impacted our reported results in the third quarter, and I will step through them to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the company and allow for comparison to our prior guidance. But the key takeaway I want you to leave with is that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August and are actively working through the business integration. Our third quarter results included two months of operational performance for the Meritor business, resulting in $737 million of sales and a total EBITDA loss of $23 million, which includes both the impact of purchase accounting and acquisition and integration costs. Our third quarter results also included $16 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. To provide clarity on the operational performance of our business, excluding the acquisition in comparison to our prior guidance, I am excluding the impact of these items in my following comments. Now let me get into more detail on our third quarter performance. Revenues were $6.6 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 19% while international revenues decreased 1%, driven by the decline in China, the impact of the suspension of our operations in Russia, and the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced our reported sales by 3%. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results, acquisition and integration costs and the costs associated with the separation of Filtration, EBITDA was $923 million or 14% of sales for the quarter compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by an increase in engineering support, engineering spend to support new product development, weaker joint venture earnings in China and the onetime bonus to recognize the commitment of our employees. This onetime bonus totaled $56 million and impacted the reported results of all operating segments, with $41 million of those costs reported within gross margin and $15 million reported within selling, admin, and research costs. Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.6 billion or 24.7% of sales increased by $213 million or 100 basis points compared to last year due to the benefits from stronger volumes and higher pricing, which more than offset higher material and people costs. Selling, admin, and research expenses increased by $110 million or 13%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting the development of products critical to achieving our Destination Zero strategy, including the fuel-agnostic engine platform, battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and PEM electrolyzer technologies. Joint venture income declined by $30 million compared to last year, primarily driven by lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $10 million, $22 million lower than a year ago, driven by $29 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our qualified benefit plans. And this compared to a gain on those investments of $1 million a year ago. Interest expense increased by $33 million due primarily to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor. Net earnings for the quarter were $468 million or $3.30 per diluted share, down from $534 million or $3.69 a year ago, with the decrease primarily attributed to an increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.7%, including $57 million or $0.40 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete items primarily related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $569 million in Q3 of last year. Now let me comment on the segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 8% from a year ago to $2.8 billion, and EBITDA decreased from 15.2% to 13.1% of sales as the benefits of pricing were more than offset by higher manufacturing and product coverage costs and lower joint venture income in China. For the full year 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 14.25%, a decrease from our previous guidance of 14.5% due to a weaker outlook in China and the impact of the onetime employee bonus. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to $2.2 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 10% compared to 9.8% a year ago due to pricing and stronger demand for parts, engines, and power generation equipment. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% compared to last year, in line with our prior guidance. EBIT is now expected to be approximately 10.5% of sales, consistent with our prior projection. Components revenue increased 10% in the third quarter, primarily driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA increased from 14.1% of sales to 16.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions and lower warranty expense. We expect full year revenues to increase 3% and project EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be approximately 16.75%, unchanged from our view three months ago. Clearly, the Components segment results are most impacted by the acquisition of Meritor, and I just want to underline that the performance excluding the addition of Meritor was exactly in line with our guidance for the quarter and for the full year. In the Power Systems segment revenues increased 16% in the third quarter to $1.3 billion, a record for the segment. EBITDA increased from 11.5% to 14.3% due to higher volumes, strong price realization, and the increased demand for aftermarket parts. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 8%. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11.25%, also up from our prior guidance of 11%, driven by stronger price realization and continued strength in sales. In the New Power segment, revenues were $45 million, up 96% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $86 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure, and capabilities to support strong future growth. For the full year 2022, we expect New Power revenues to be up approximately $180 million, down slightly from our prior guidance of $200 million due to delays in some customer projects and some supply chain constraints. Underlying demand, however, continues to grow for both battery electric systems and electrolyzers. Net expense for this segment is now projected to be $310 million compared to our prior guidance of $290 million, driven by increased investment to scale up electrolyzer production capacity and bring new products to market. As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our 2022 expectations of total company revenues to be up 8%, and we now expect our EBITDA margins at approximately 15% for the full year. To be clear, once again, that this guidance excludes the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, the impact of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, and any expenses associated with preparing for the separation of the Filtration business. This guidance does imply an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline by 25% to 30% in 2022 due to the ongoing weakness in China and the impact of suspension of our business in Russia, and that is slightly worse than our prior guidance of down 25%, all due to the conditions in China. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% in 2022, lots of 22s there, excluding any discrete items, an increase from our prior guidance of 21.5%. Excluding Meritor, our capital expenditures in the quarter were $179 million, up from $150 million a year ago, and we're maintaining our full year guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. We returned $245 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the third quarter, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to $1 billion year-to-date. For the full year 2022, we still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And as I've already mentioned, we expect the Meritor revenues to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for the five months of this year under our ownership, and EBITDA to be approximately 4.5%, including the impact of purchase accounting. In closing, I want to again reinforce that Cummins is in a strong position, growing our leadership in our core markets while setting up the company for a stronger future through investment in new products and capabilities. And we are adjusting our portfolio of businesses, all while returning cash to shareholders. We do expect to deliver stronger profitability in the fourth quarter as implied in our full year guidance. Thank you for your guidance today -- no, your interest today. My guidance, your interest. Thank you. Now let me turn it over to Chris. Christopher Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question. Operator : Okay, our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please state your question. Stephen Volkmann : Great. Good morning guys. Thank you. Mark, I'm interested in your guidance. Mark, you kind of have my head spinning here. I apologize for that, it's a busy day. But how are you going to report the next quarter in terms of Meritor? I assume that will be in the numbers, but you'll probably adjust out maybe the purchase accounting, I'm just trying to figure out sort of on a like-for-like basis, kind of how we're supposed to think about the next quarter? Mark Smith : Yes, so what we're trying to do and we realize it's complex for us also, there's a lot going on, Steve. So what we're trying to do is make clear how we're performing against our guidance in the Cummins business prior to the Meritor acquisition, which we lowered that guidance just to be clear and we'll try to be clear for the reasons why. And then we'll layer on the Meritor performance. So we're trying to give projections for both. We will report all in and then just as we've done this quarter in the earnings material, we'll break out the business pre-Meritor, Meritor separately, and the different elements so you can try and get a fuller picture and then next year, we'll move to the all-in reporting. But we will continue to provide details around Meritor, so that you can gain confidence that we're making progress on executing on the integration and growth of that business going forward. So the answer is yes, it's going to look similar in Q4 to this quarter. The noise from the purchase accounting will start to go -- will taper down next quarter and in subsequent quarters. But we're going to report with and without, so we're not reducing the visibility of our performance on either front. That's the main goal. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, all right, fair enough. Maybe just a quick switch then, we've seen a couple of months now of pretty amazing heavy truck orders in the United States, North America. And I'm curious kind of what you're hearing as you talk to customers and sort of the outlook longer term, I mean, are you guys starting to slot in deliveries for these big orders that we're seeing and just kind of any color that you can give us there would be great? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, Steve. We continue to see strong heavy-duty customer order interest. The conversations that I have with both end customers and OEMs are around how we're working through supply constraints that continue to exist and increase production rates. And this has just not been a typical cycle, so all of those fundamentals for the business remain strong. We project that the market will remain strong into next year because they've been using the trucks at a high rate. They've not been able to replace at the level that they want to. And as well, these new trucks that are coming out, new powertrains have improved efficiency and as you see higher fuel prices, that's also attractive. So we continue to watch the broader economic indicators and what that may mean over time. Right now, we're continuing to work to increase production rates and see strong underlying demand. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, thanks. I will pass it on. Appreciate it. Jennifer Rumsey : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie with Credit Suisse. Please state your question. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions. The R&D is up considerably sequentially. So -- and I know we're continuing to invest, but I'm wondering if we should think about that as a new run rate, is R&D going to be structurally higher and sort of the implications for 2023? And I guess my same question is on the SG&A side, even if we back out the $15 million that hit SG&A because of the bonus, the onetime bonus that was also up materially .And I'm just trying to think about spend in the context of concerns on the macro, understanding your customers are still saying things are strong now, but are we taking any actions in the case the macro does weaken? Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, great. Thanks, Jamie, for the question. Good to hear from you. We have, as you noted, taken up our R&D spend in particular in the Engine business and the New Power business where we have strategic investments in the fuel-agnostic platform and growing investments in electrolyzers and other key New Power technologies. And so we will continue to make those investments. And as we have in the past, we're going to manage through the cycles and improve performance, underlying financial performance of the company through the up and the down cycles while still making these key strategic investments that will position us to outgrow over time. We are looking closely at our priorities for next year. We are starting to more closely manage any headcount addition, so that we make sure that we're continuing to invest in key strategic areas while also managing those investments for potential downside scenarios. So we are more closely scrutinizing those priorities right now. Mark Smith : Yes, and I would just add to that. We have lowered our admin costs like three quarters in a row. There is a tremendous focus on trying to flatten our costs out there, in particular, the increase in the SG&A was really in the selling side, which is a lot of that's tied to our aftermarket business and the Power Systems business, which is [Technical Difficulty] engineering on with the upward pressure and these are under the other type of pressure. Jamie Cook : Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob with Melius Research. Please state your question. Robert Wertheimer : Thanks and hello, everybody. My question would be and I'm not sure it's an easy one to answer off the cuff. But when you look at your blended pricing on engines versus the OEM pricing on trucks across your customer base or if you wanted to specify North America, do you feel like you're caught up in that regard or do you have a couple of hundred bps to catch up? And could you lay out the time frame at which you would catch up if you think you are behind the OEM prices, which have a little bit more flexibility? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, Rob, this is how I would describe it. Over -- since the start of 2021, what we've seen is supply challenges and inflation that has driven cost and inefficiency into our business. For 2022, we are expecting a 400 basis point improvement in price compared to a 230 basis point impact on cost. So we are ahead for the year when you think about that price/cost balance, and we're also working to make improvements in operating efficiency. And we continue to have work to do to get back to where we were at the start of 2021. And we're able to price more rapidly into our aftermarket business. But of course, where we've got high backlog in the Power Systems business or long-term contracts, right, that takes time to flow through as we negotiate with customers and that we have metal market and other contractual agreements that also flow through over time, but not immediately. Mark Smith : And just to confirm, the reason -- one of the reasons why we're ahead on price and material cost this year was, in fact, we bore a lot of those costs in the second half of 2021. Robert Wertheimer : Are you still there, Mark? Mark Smith : Yes, yes. Robert Wertheimer : Okay, sorry. Got it, got it. And then could you give a general comment on just supply chain, do you feel like we've peaked out on risk, China may be doing lockdowns again, so if you take that after globally how does the risk of upside/downside on cost and supply chain feel to you? And I'll stop there. Thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Sure, on the supply chain side, we continue to see improvement and we also still have issues. So at this point, electronic component continues to be our biggest risk and disruptor. But as you said, there continue to be these dynamic lockdowns in China, congestion in certain ports that is more in the East Coast, more in Europe. And so we continue to see some supply chain disruption. So from where I sit, quarter-over-quarter it's been improving and we've been taking build rates up and able to drive some operational improvement, and those issues are not completely gone. And so that is, in part, influencing this continued expectation that we'll see improvement going into Q4 and into next year. Robert Wertheimer : Alright, thank you. Mark Smith : Thanks Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from David with Evercore. Please state your question. Mark Smith : David, you there? David Raso : Yes, I am. Sorry about that. Just so I can understand exactly the fourth quarter, sort of what you're adding back to 3Q, can you tell us what is your implied EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter, just so I can level set? Mark Smith : 15.5 ex Meritor. David Raso : So 15.5 for the fourth quarter? Mark Smith : Compared to core -- yes. David Raso : Then when I think about China, obviously, it's a big driver in the EBITDA margin, just given a lot of the truck business comes in as JV income. I know the consolidated aspect of construction activity there for your business. But obviously, truck, looking forward, how should we think about what you're seeing in China just from what you normally would see around Chinese New Year, obviously, with the Congress they just had their stimulus, a lot of things going on, I'm just curious, I thought Beijing Photon, in particular, was a little weaker than I would have thought, but I'm just curious what you're seeing on the truck side in particular? Mark Smith : No significant momentum at all there right now, Dave, so that's certainly not part of the improvement from Q3 to Q4. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, and as you noted, I mean, they just had -- the Congress elected Xi to third term. We typically see some seasonality in that market. It's difficult to predict at this point. So as Mark said, we're not projecting improvements through the end of the year. David Raso : And when it comes to the power gen business, and within that you obviously have some of the mining. Can you give us a little perspective, I mean, early look at 2023, how you're thinking about that business, just given the recent results were pretty healthy? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, like the U.S. truck market, the Power Systems markets continue to remain strong. We have -- there's a large back order there so we're projecting strength going into next year. David Raso : Thank you very much. Mark Smith : Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi, good morning everyone. Mark Smith : Good morning Jerry. Jerry Revich : Hey Mark. I'm wondering if you folks can talk about, as we head into 2023, you've got a number of tailwinds in terms of electrolyzer production ramping up, the eAxles ramping up at Meritor and maybe some medium-duty engine production ramping based on your recent wins. Looking at the new product contribution 2023 versus 2022, can you just outline for us the magnitude of tailwind, it feels like the electrolyzer opportunity is tracking ahead of expectations, but maybe I can get you to expand on that, if you don't mind. Mark Smith : What I would say is, yes, we've got line of sight into improving demand in New Power business I would expect at this point in time without getting into specific numbers, both growth in battery electric systems and electrolyzer sales next year. So I think the momentum is going to continue in New Power. And then yes, we've got strong customer demand on the eAxle side. Again, I don't think that's going to be a dramatic change relative to a $27 billion company. But demand is strong. I've got clearest visibility into the New Power side right now. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, and on the electrolyzers, as I talked about some of the investment in production capacity. So we're in the early stages of building up that production capacity, building up the backlog. It's going to be lumpy at this point, and it's going to grow, as Mark said, over time. And we still feel really good. In fact, the Inflation Reduction Act and the climate provisions around that are strengthening the hydrogen outlook in the U.S. Jerry Revich : Super. And can I ask, the initial customer response on the Meritor integration. Can you talk about what those conversations have been like, particularly as it pertains to selling eAxle and conventional axles to traditional Cummins customers that haven't been Meritor customers? And if you could touch on within the Meritor margin guidance, what's the inventory step-up that's embedded, that's depressing results looks like by at least two points, but I'm wondering if you could outline that relative to the full year guide on Slide 14 for Meritor? Thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, we're obviously in the early days of integrating the Meritor business, excited to have that as part of us, starting to have conversations with customers at a strategic level. And it's a positive for them that we have added Meritor to our portfolio and can talk about how we're serving them both in the core businesses and New Power business going forward. Early days and those conversations are both on operational and supply as well as the strategic opportunities that we have. Mark Smith : Yes, a lot of focus on demand and delivery right now as there is in other parts of our business, Jerry. So we aren't short of demand. We need to keep raising those production rates. Christopher Clulow : And Jerry, on your question on the inventory step-up and there's a good reconciliation in the earnings deck, which talks through the complicated picture that is Meritor for this quarter. It's about $32 million was the impact in the third quarter of that inventory step-up. Jerry Revich : Any in the fourth, Chris? Christopher Clulow : Just a small bit. Most of that inventory burns off quickly as you would expect, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Super, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tami with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So I have a couple of modeling questions. So my first question is, I saw in your presentation that Meritor's GAAP EBITDA rate I think you said, was 4.5%. And so can you help us with what it would have been on a non-GAAP basis because as we think about incorporating Meritor in our model, let's say for next year, what non-GAAP EBITDA rate should we be using and do you expect that rate to improve over the next few years just to better integrate that business? Christopher Clulow : Yes. So let me try to unpack that a little bit. So the U.S. GAAP results essentially for Meritor at itself was essentially breakeven in the second quarter. And as Jen mentioned, our guidance for the full year for 2022 is about 4.5%. So that implies the U.S. GAAP, when you take out -- including the purchase accounting in Q2 and a little bit in Q3, implies an EBITDA of about 9% in the fourth quarter and that was up from, if you take out some of the noise in the third quarter, that was approximately 7.3% operating EBITDA. So we're seeing a step-up there. And then we would continue to -- as we go towards the future, continue to drive improvement there, both through the synergies we gain as well as other improvements in the business. So that gives you some view of kind of the trajectory there. I'm happy to talk through more separately, if you like. Mark Smith : But also the performance in the short run, of course, is going to be dependent on the market. And we'll give you all of those elements, both in the Q4 and as we get to next year. I realize it's messy and appreciate everyone's patience as we've tried to work out the best disclosures to give you all this information. We'll continue to err on the side of sharing more and not less to make it as clear as possible. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That's super helpful. And another quick one from me from a modeling perspective, the bonus that you gave to employees this quarter, as we lap it next year, we should be treating it as one-off for now, right? Mark Smith : Yes, it won't be present even in the fourth quarter results and that's one of the factors why our EBITDA margins will -- not the only factor but one of the factors why our margins will be better in the fourth quarter. Tami Zakaria : Okay, awesome, great. Thank you so much. Mark Smith : Thanks Tami. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven with UBS. Please state your question. Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. So lots of puts and takes, but just to kind of summarize at a high level, is the overall message that basically your power gen business is a bit better than you're expecting, China is a bit worse and the China drag is just kind of a bit bigger than you have the benefit from power gen and you have slightly higher investments in New Power, I mean, is that sort of the key summary of it of the core business? And then you gave the 15.5% margin implied for Q4. Is there any bridge you can give us from Q3 EBITDA to Q4, I know you just mentioned, obviously, the $56 million of employee costs, is there any other sort of just direct bridge you can give us to help go from Q3 to Q4? Mark Smith : Yes, there are really three core elements to that bridge, Steve: the bonus we've mentioned, a little bit of improvement in pricing from Q3 to Q4; and then we did have some operational challenges concentrated in one or two areas and we expect those to improve. And those three elements are the key drivers of the margin rebound. No improvement in China baked in, no significant increase in expenses expected in the fourth quarter. Steven Fisher : Okay. And would you agree with that sort of the summary I gave of kind of what the main puts and takes of the core business were? Mark Smith : Yes. And the only other thing is we continue to incur these mark-to-market losses so we didn't call them out. At some point, that will stabilize and rebound. Those were present in the third quarter but at a lower rate than in the second quarter. So that's noise in the other income line. Steven Fisher : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just in terms of the heavy-duty truck market in North America, I'm curious how much visibility you have to the second half of 2023 at this point. I know you talked earlier about the order strength. I guess I'm just curious how far into 2023 the OEMs have given you their work plans and the confidence you have there relative to the first half? Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, I mean we are of course talking about outlook and forecast with our OEM customers and staying close to them on that. At this point, we've got about a nine-month backlog based on strong orders in September and October. And we'll continue to stay close to them to watch how that outlook evolves in the second half of the year. Steven Fisher : Perfect, thank you. Mark Smith : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt with Cowen. Please state your question. Matthew Elkott : Good morning, thank you. Can you just talk about the rationale behind doing a onetime bonus rather than further pay increases, I mean, is it that just you didn't want to lock in to pay increases ahead of a possible moderation of labor costs overall in the economy or did something specific happen in the quarter that made it necessary to do the bonus in order to not have a lot of attrition? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, really it was more of the latter. So of course, we're always looking at pay and what's happening with the market as it relates to labor costs. But really, we felt very strongly that given the tremendous effort of our employees over the last 18 months to deliver revenue at the level we did and work through all of the supply chain challenges and continue to commit to deliver key strategic growth initiatives, and given the environment where they are experiencing higher inflation, the impact to them, and the labor market is tighter. We felt that this onetime recognition was very appropriate to show appreciation, to mitigate attrition, and really motivate people to be connected to delivering and continuing to deliver for the company. Matthew Elkott : Got it, makes sense. And then just a bigger picture question. You're expecting strong demand in mining and oil and gas for the rest of the year. Does it look like this momentum should continue into 2023? And on the mining side, does it look like the -- this demand is being driven by equipment replacement, I know we had equipment replacement cycle threatening to happen for the last decade, and it's been false starts, does it look to you guys like this time, it could be a multiyear replacement cycle on the mining side? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, we do see that demand continuing into next year. Of course, in oil and gas with the energy challenges, there's a lot of demand to invest there. And we'll have to continue to monitor those economic indicators over time. But right now in both of those markets, we continue to see strong demand holding into 2023. Mark Smith : Yes, we're pretty much sold out for this year. There are some regional factors, increased coal production in India. There's some local factors as well as the overall security and availability of energy across borders. Matthew Elkott : Thanks very much. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah with Oppenheimer. Please state your question. Noah Kaye : Alright, thanks for taking my questions. Just sticking with Off-Highway first. You mentioned that it's really the engine sales to some of the construction customers in North America, that growth being driven by CAPEX from rental companies and pricing. Have you started to see any benefits kicking in from IIJA yet, is that sort of a demand tailwind for 2023 or potentially beyond? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act is going to drive investment in infrastructure to support some of these clean energy technology. So we expect, over time, we'll see increased electrolyzer demand, as I alluded to earlier, and that could also provide benefit to underlying construction demand in the U.S. It's early, right, to actually see the specific impact of that. But certainly, it should provide a positive benefit. Noah Kaye : Sorry, I know we've had a lot of legislation out of Washington. I was talking about the IIJA, the Infrastructure Bill. Jennifer Rumsey : Sorry. Did I respond on the wrong one? Noah Kaye : Yes. It sounds you have multiple shots on goal, but just wondering if you can talk through kind of any impact from the Infrastructure Bill so far? Christopher Clulow : Yes, thanks, Noah. I think the Infrastructure Bill is similar -- actually it's having a very similar outcome, whereas obviously, the IRA is driving more into the New Power space. We are seeing some good momentum in that space. And we benefit that whether through the rental companies or some of the other construction equipment in North America has remained strong through this year and is carrying forward that momentum as those -- we continue to build out and there's a lot of work to be done, as you know. So that is certainly helping us. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. And then I know a couple of folks have asked about Meritor impact going forward for next year. So I know we won't be precise here, but just for everybody's modeling, as we think about Components margin, I mean you annualized this year 7.5% EBITDA margin, add some synergies capture and some growth, it's still going to be a margin headwind in Components of probably a couple of hundred bps, right, as we look at 2023, is that a good starting point? Mark Smith : Yes. On a percentage basis, it's clearly going to be dilutive in the early part of the ownership and the goal is to keep working that up over time. Noah Kaye : And any early color on the cadence of the synergies capture that you can give us? Mark Smith : No. I mean, we're working on that. We've got teams dedicated to that, working on that every day. Still feel confident about the numbers we gave earlier of $130 million pretax by year three. And I will say we're finding some other synergies as well in taxes and other things that are not included there. But lot of work still ahead of us, a lot of good progress to start and, of course, integrating the employees, that's a lot of work but we're off to a good start. I will say the business -- that business is also very busy with demand and supply challenges just as we are in our core. So we very much appreciate the hard work of the employees. We're listening towards driving synergies and improvement in their operations. They're all very busy and we appreciate that. Noah Kaye : Okay, thanks so much for the color. Mark Smith : Thanks Noah. Operator : That was our final question, and that concludes the Q&A session of this call. I'll turn it back over to Chris for closing remarks. Christopher Clulow : Thank you, everyone -- much, everyone, for joining. As always, we will be available this afternoon to answer any questions that you may have from the Investor Relations perspective, and I appreciate your attendance today. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Chris Clulow : Thank you very much. Good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins\u2019 results for the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the full year performance. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that, some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with a summary of 2022, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. Last year was an incredibly exciting one for Cummins and our stakeholders. We made significant strides in our inorganic growth strategy, most notably through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. We also navigated complex global supply chain challenges, advanced our preparation for the separation of our filtration business and transition from Tom to me as the CEO. We accomplished all of this and delivered record revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share in 2022. We did so with the focus on the exciting opportunity in front of us to lead the industry to a broader clean economy and do so in a way that is best for our stakeholders and the planet. Decarbonization is a growth opportunity for Cummins, uniting our business and climate goals. In 2022, we launched our long-term decarbonization growth strategy, Destination Zero, which includes making meaningful reductions in carbon emissions through advanced internal combustion technologies widely accepted by the market today, while continuing to invest in and advance zero emissions technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. As part of our organic growth strategy, we unveiled the industry\u2019s first unified fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain platforms, and we continue to see momentum in our electrolyzer technology and green hydrogen production opportunities. Demand for our products remains strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $7.8 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand in many of our North America markets. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance, I\u2019m excluding the Meritor operating results and associated acquisition and integration costs, the costs related to the separation of the filtration business and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. Mark will provide more detail on the reported results in his comments. With these exclusions considered, EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% of sales in Q4, above our guidance of 15.5% and stronger than the $705 million or 12.1% reported a year ago. EBITDA and percentage improved due to an increase in gross margins with positive pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage costs and some improvement in logistics costs, all of which offset increases in material costs. Gross margin improvement is key to meeting our long-term goals of increasing the returns in our core business while transitioning our New Power business to break even EBITDA by 2027. In the fourth quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement, and we continue to accelerate value capture opportunities across the business. Our employees have done an excellent job in integrating the Meritor operations and people within Cummins and continue to make strides in identifying cost reduction opportunities. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $130 million in pretax synergies we referenced upon completion of the acquisition. And in addition, we expect to deliver incremental tax synergies as we integrate the business. Excluding Meritor, 2022 revenues were a record $26.2 billion, 9% higher than 2021. Also excluding Meritor, the costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and the impact of the indefinite suspension of our Russia operations, full year EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% of sales compared to $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales in 2021. Improved volumes, better price realization and an improved supply chain environment more than offset higher compensation expenses, increased material costs and lower joint venture income for the year. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in Engine, Power Systems, Distribution and Components segments. Leading the way was the Components segment, which delivered 150 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. The Power Systems business finished 2022 with another solid quarter and delivered full year EBITDA of 12.2%, up from 11.2% last year. The improvement in performance in this segment over the past six months is encouraging, and you will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. EBITDA margins in the distribution business increased by 110 basis points. Our reported full year 2022 results include five months of operational performance for Meritor or $1.9 billion of revenue and $26 million of EBITDA, including $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2023 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2023 guidance includes our expected results of the Meritor business and excludes the costs or benefits associated with the separation of the filtration business. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2023 to increase 12% to 17%, compared to 2022 and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales, driven by the inclusion of a full year of sales from Meritor, continued strength in the North American truck market, improved demand in power generation markets, overall pricing improvement and slow improvement in the China on-highway markets. Industry\u2019s production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2023, a range of a 5% decline to 2% improvement year-over-year. In medium-duty truck, we expect the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. We expect our deliveries in North America to continue to outpace the market, as the engine partnerships we announced in 2021 continue to phase in. Our Engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 7% in 2023. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy and medium duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in demand in the light duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 25% to 35% in 2023 as the market adjusts to new emissions regulations and digests inventory on hand. We are watching the situation in China closely, with ensuring the safety and well-being of our people as our first priority. The change in the country\u2019s COVID lockdown policy could positively impact our operations in the coming months. The current events make it difficult to gauge. The markets within China are at a low point, as we close out 2022 and our guidance assumes a slow recovery in 2023. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to be up 1% in 2023. We expect the industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, dependent upon the trajectory of commodity prices and supply chain improvement. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, primarily driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvements in the data center market. In New Power, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, more than doubling our 2022 revenues. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to convert to backlog and to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, we shared that we had reached the milestone of a $100 million in electrolyzer backlog. This tripled to $300 million at the end of 2022, demonstrating the strong momentum in this market. With demand continuing to rise, we are focused on adding capacity for electrolyzer production. During 2022 we announced several capacity expansion investments and expect to have more than two gigawatts of scalable capacity in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe across Europe, North America and China. Additionally, we will continue to deliver battery, electric and fuel cell systems along with electric powertrain technologies as adoption continues in the transportation markets. As mentioned, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. We are continuing to drive improvement in our margins post-acquisition and expect Meritor to be accretive to earnings per share in 2023. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. Within Components, we expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue in 2023 with EBITDA margins in the range of 10.3% to 11%, an improvement from the comparable 2022 EBITDA margin of 7.2%. The electric powertrain portion of the Meritor business has been integrated within the New Power portfolio with projected 2023 EBITDA losses of $55 million included in the overall guidance for that segment. In 2023 we anticipate that demand will remain strong in most of our key regions and markets, especially in the first half of the year. While some macroeconomic indicators have weakened in recent months, we have not seen a significant change in customer orders at this time. In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 12% to 17% and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales. We have taken a number of actions to improve our EBITDA in 2023 and expect to generate very strong incremental margins within our core business and improve the margins of the Meritor business while continuing to invest in our New Power business. Having effectively managed through the challenges of the past couple years we expect improved performance in 2023 and are well positioned to invest in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. There are four key takeaways from my comments today. First, we delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding our own projections for revenue and EBITDA from three months ago, and we delivered stronger margins Engines, Components, Distribution and Power Systems compared to a year ago. Second, we continue to make good progress on the integration of Meritor and we remain on-track to deliver $130 million of pretax synergies by the end of year three. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, demand for our products remains strong, supporting increased revenues in our core business and New Power and growth in EBITDA and earnings per share in 2023. Now, let me go into more details on the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $7.8 billion and EBITDA of $1.1 billion or 14.2%. For the full year, revenues were $28.1 billion and EBITDA of $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales. Also in the fourth quarter, Meritor generated $1.2 billion of revenue, $60 million of EBITDA, after incurring $27 million of acquisition and integration related costs. Our fourth quarter results also included $19 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Full year 2022 results included five months of operational performance for Meritor, yielding $1.9 billion of revenue, $26 million of EBITDA, reflecting $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. We will all look forward to a cleaner set of numbers in 2023. Our full year 2022 results also included $81 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance. I am excluding the Meritor results and the separation of filtration and the indefinite suspension of Russia in my following comments. But hopefully, you are clear after my earlier remarks about the magnitude of those -- each of those items. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 25%, driven by continued strong demand in truck markets. International revenues decreased 1% with stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment in most markets, offset by declines in China and, of course, the impact of our suspension of our operations in Russia. Currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% due to a stronger U.S. dollar. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% compared to $705 million or 12.1% a year ago. EBITDA increased by $359 million due mainly to improved pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage expenses, all of which contributed to stronger gross margin performance and more than offset higher material costs. Now, let\u2019s go into our income statement, a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 26.3% of sales increased by $420 million or 380 basis points from a year ago. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $52 million or 6% due to higher compensation and research costs as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly in the Engines and New Power segments. Joint venture income decreased $28 million due to lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $44 million, an increase of $13 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher pension income. Interest expense increased $58 million, largely driven by the financing costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.2%, including $52 million or $0.36 per diluted share -- favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $631 million or $4.43 per diluted share, up from $394 million or $2.73 a year ago. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $817 million, including Meritor and, $85 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by higher earnings. For the full year \u201822, revenues were a record $26.2 billion or up 9% from a year ago, with sales in North America up 18% and international revenues down 2%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues for the full year by 2%. EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% for 2022 compared to $3.5 billion of 14.7% of sales a year ago. Improvements in Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Engine margins were partially offset by increased investment in New Power and more than $100 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin some of our nonqualified benefit plans. All of that run through our operating EBITDA. All-in net earnings were $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share compared to $2.1 billion or $14.61 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion, primarily due to higher inventory levels. Capital expenditures in 2022 were $916 million, an increase of $182 million from 2021 as we continue to invest in new products and capacity expansion critical for future growth. We returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders or 63% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends last year. Now, moving on to our guidance for 2023, which includes Meritor, and thankfully, reduces the number of exclusions we\u2019ll have to explain each quarter, and I appreciate your patience as we work through that in 2022. We are excluding any separation costs associated with filtration, and for now, we\u2019re assuming that the operating results of filtration are in our guidance for the full year 2023, as the timing of that separation is not yet determined. We expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion of revenue in 2023. We currently project 2023 company revenues, including Meritor, to be up 12% to 17% and company-wide EBITDA margins expected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.2%. In \u201823, we expect revenues for the Engine business will be flat to up 5%, driven by continued strength in North American truck market and a modest recovery in China. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% compared to 14.4% in 2022. We expect distribution revenues this year to be up 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% compared to 10.5% in 2022. Including Meritor, we expect 2023 components revenues to increase 28% to 33% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8% compared to 15.0% in 2022. In \u201823, we also expect Power Systems revenues to be up 5% to 10% due to higher demand for oil and gas engines and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA there is projected to be between 13% and 13.7%, up from 12.2% of sales last year. And also this year, we expect New Power revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million. We expect New Power net losses to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million as we continue to make targeted investments in capacity, technology to support growing customer demand. Our goal remains to achieve breakeven EBITDA in 2027. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 22%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time and have accelerated cash returns to shareholders in recent years above that 50% goal when we have generated more cash than required to support our strategy. In 2023, we will prioritize cash towards dividends and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor while continuing to invest to deliver future profitable growth. Having a strong balance sheet is an important asset as we navigate through economic cycles and sustain our investments in new products for existing and new markets. To summarize, we delivered record sales, strong full year earnings in 2022, while managing through supply chain challenges and a very weak demand environment in China. As we move through 2023, demand for our products remains strong in most of our core markets with good visibility into the first half of the year. We\u2019ll continue to focus on raising margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, generating strong cash flow and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies and penetrate new markets through our New Power business. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it over to Chris. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we\u2019re ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : I know it\u2019s early post the acquisition of the Siemens propulsion systems and Meritor, but wondering if you could just comment on what the acceptance has been of the products in the marketplace? Post-Cummins ownership, what\u2019s the pipeline from the developments look like? How is that cross-selling working out versus what you folks had expected before acquiring the assets? Thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Thanks, Jerry, for the question. Yes, we are right now really focused on integrating the Meritor business, the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business and the investments that we were already making within New Power and having a number of conversations with our customers on how we bring that together to deliver those electric powertrains and components to meet their needs. So, it brings some strong products, employees as well as customer relationships, and we\u2019re seeing growing opportunities as we have relationships at a senior more strategic level with these customers to grow our business going forward. It\u2019s really early days at this point, so we\u2019ll continue to talk about that as we bring those businesses together. Jerry Revich : Sounds good, Jennifer, thanks. And Mark, can I ask in terms of the pricing that you\u2019re expecting in \u201823 within the outlook? And if you could just touch on the logistics costs embedded in the guide as well. You folks have been running pretty hot to hit deliveries in \u201822. I\u2019m wondering to what extent does that a tailwind within the guidance? Mark Smith : Yes, we\u2019ve got about 2% of price cost benefit embedded in the guidance, Jerry. That\u2019s the biggest single driver of margin improvement. Operator : The next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : I guess, two questions. Just given the concern on the macro out there, can you guys speak to by business line where you see the most visibility or where demand trends do you see sort of weakening? And then, I guess, on the engine margin guidance. I guess, I would have thought margins would have been a little better in implied guide just given maybe price cost going away, China improving. So, if you can just help me bridge 2023 to 2022 engine margins what\u2019s implied? Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Great. Thanks, Jamie. Let me speak first to what we\u2019re seeing in the market. And we, of course, are paying attention to some of these macroeconomic trends. If you take just the North America truck market as a starting point, while there has been some decrease in spot rates, we still continue to see healthy freight activity and strong backlogs out through the first half, which gives us confidence that the market is going to remain strong, certainly through the first half of the year. And it\u2019s important to note, it\u2019s just not been a typical cycle for us because for the last two years, we\u2019ve been undersupplying to the market demand. They\u2019ve been using that equipment. We\u2019re seeing that reflected in very high aftermarket demand which continues, and these new trucks provide efficiency benefits to the fleet. So, we continue to expect strong North America truck market. In the Power Systems business, again, we have a healthy backlog of products and strong demand across many of our markets. Mining, we\u2019re forecasting to remain around flat, but growth in power generation, growth in the oil and gas business. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty confident about that as well. The biggest uncertainty is really around China. And as I said in my comments, we do project some slow recovery throughout 2023. With the lift of the stringent lockdowns that they had in the last couple of years in December, we expect that that may result in economic strengthening and certainly, less operational disruption, but we\u2019re still monitoring what happens with the COVID waves there, is there any government stimulus into the economy. We feel really well positioned there. We\u2019ve launched our NS VI products, which we think will enable Cummins to grow our position in the market. We\u2019ve launched the automated manual transmission there. We\u2019ve got a new natural gas platform. So, we\u2019re really well positioned as China continues to strengthen and just uncertainty on exactly what the shape of that will look like. I\u2019ll let Mark talk about the margin question. Mark Smith : Yes. I think the main thing on the Engine business margins is that we haven\u2019t got building a very strong recovery in China. And then the other piece that you didn\u2019t mention, Jamie, is that we\u2019ve got fairly sustained investments ahead of us over the next couple of years because we\u2019re updating several of our platforms. We\u2019ve won a lot of external business, and we\u2019ve got to meet future emissions regulations. So, that\u2019s the only other element that\u2019s running through the Engine business that may not be obvious from the outside, but otherwise, we\u2019ll expect them to do well if markets continue to be strong. Operator : The next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephen Volkmann : Maybe just following on, on the Engine margin question, Mark. Given what you just described around increased spending, R&D, et cetera, should we think about sort of flattish incremental margins over the next few years, or can it still be better than that, if we have some volume? Mark Smith : I think it can definitely be better than that. We\u2019re still battling some inefficiencies here and there Steve. We\u2019re still expecting to have aftermarket growth over time. So no, we\u2019re not locked into these margins. I was just trying to be clear on what the underlying factors. I\u2019ve seen a few comments around Engine business margins, but no, I think they can go higher. Getting China, which is the world\u2019s biggest truck market, I know the earnings come through JV, we have the lowest market in a decade. And we think we still got more share to gain there. We\u2019ve got more content in the Components business. So, if I sit here today and say what could be the one thing that could move that could change our guidance most clearly, I would agree with Jen, it would be China, right now. We don\u2019t have visibility. People are more enthusiastic, but the activity hasn\u2019t yet materially picked up. So, that would be one important factor. Stephen Volkmann : Great, understood. And then, my follow-on maybe a bigger, broader question. But as we start very early days but we start to think about the 2027 emissions regulations, do you guys feel like you have line of sight to what you need to do technically to get there? We\u2019re starting to hear that this is going to be sort of the biggest emission hurdle ever and that some people may have trouble getting there or maybe have some massive costs associated with it, which has some implications for prebuys and maybe whether people do it themselves or outsource it to you, just your big picture thinking on 2027 and how that kind of plays through. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. We are focused on continuing to meet more stringent regulatory requirements and do so with products that will provide benefits to the environment and exceed our customer needs. We now have clarity on the EPA 2027 NOx regulations that happened late last year, and they finalize that standard at a 0.035 gram NOx. And our intention is to offer a full product lineup with our new fuel-agnostic engine platforms to meet that regulation, and we\u2019re finalizing our product plans right now with our customers on those. But we really feel well positioned to invest in really as a part of our Destination Zero strategy, reduce CO2 and NOx impact to the environment and offer products -- market-leading products to our customers with that regulation. Operator : The next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Raso : Hi. Thank you. The China guide, the up 7%, I assume that includes consolidated and JV revenue, sort of how you usually kind of speak to it. Mark Smith : Yes. David Raso : Even -- maybe can you update us on the mix of your end markets? It feels like the consolidated off-highway, the construction exposure you have that shows up in the P&L more so than JV, and the JV is more of the on-highway. I\u2019m surprised with the mix because that construction business at this stage must be pretty small after the declines we\u2019ve seen. So, to have truck up double digit for China, for heavy and light, even though the excavator is down a lot, the mix would suggest you\u2019d be up more than 7%, if truck is up double digit and at now relatively small construction business is down. Are there other businesses keeping it only at 7%? Is there a share comment there? Just trying to understand why only up 7% with that China end market guide? Mark Smith : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything significant in there, David. I mean, obviously, whether it\u2019s consolidated or unconsolidated, trucks probably [70%] plus when you add up all of our markets. So, the truck does better, we\u2019ll be up more than 7%. If it doesn\u2019t, we won\u2019t. I think for components, that\u2019s all consolidated revenue. That\u2019s almost entirely on-highway. It\u2019s really the engine business that has the off-highway business of any of any size. And then, yes, I think Power Systems has been pretty strong last year in China. It has probably been the exception to what we\u2019ve seen in every other market. But there\u2019s no big change in dynamics. Jennifer Rumsey : Just on your share, we expect to continue to grow our share in the China market with the launch of the NS VI product. So, that\u2019s assumed in our guidance. David Raso : I\u2019d even think with some of the transmissions as well. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand like Photon is struggling more than I would have thought. It\u2019s still barely making money now for two quarters in a row. Is there something about that dynamic we should be more sensitive to on the margin recovery in China in the JV because of Photon? Mark Smith : No. We did get some sizable tech fees and other things from the early part of last year, which kind of helped -- the wrong word, we were entitled to those based on product launches, but no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything significant there. David Raso : And I\u2019ll hop off, just one kind of modeling question. If you take the interest expense in the fourth quarter and annualize it, it\u2019s $348 million. You mentioned there\u2019s debt reduction, but your guide is $380 million. I mean, what are we assuming for interest rates from the fourth quarter on to have up interest expense, but you\u2019re targeting debt reduction? Mark Smith : Right. So, I think the answer to that is, we\u2019ll need to keep working that down. I think we\u2019ve got some floating rate exposure. It\u2019s not all fixed, and probably, the debt reduction will come in the second half of the year, but let me come back to you on that, David. Operator : The next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wertheimer : Hi. I know it\u2019s still early days, but you\u2019re starting to see some ramp in electrolyzers. And I guess there\u2019s obviously a lot of uncertainty as to what the ultimate margin structure is going to be, New Power or clean energy generally. So I wonder if you have any thoughts on when you see clarity, any thoughts on where gross margins might trend. Maybe you\u2019re still heavily investing, but the gross margins are improving, or just your thoughts on how the curve of profitability is shaping up in clean tech. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, the electrolyzer business is really going to drive the majority of our progress towards breakeven in \u201827 for New Power and the growth aspirations that we shared for 2030. And so, we expect during that time frame to scale up the product, the supply chain and manufacturing and continue to see growing backlog and conversion of orders into revenue. And so through that time period, you\u2019ll see margins going positive and improving, the exact margin structure of that business is still unclear. There\u2019s not a lot of suppliers in the market, and we expect demand to be quite strong through that time period. So, I\u2019m optimistic on what margin structure for the business will look like. But, obviously, we\u2019ll share more as we get towards that breakeven point and go margin positive. Mark Smith : Yes. Rob, one thing I\u2019ll add is, for the gross margin on a project basis, we\u2019re at gross margin positive last year, which is a good early indicator. We have other costs that are going in, too, for capacity expansion and other things that obviously offsets that, but it\u2019s a good indicator that we\u2019re on the right path for profitability as we move forward with more volume. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And obviously, there\u2019s just still a lot of build-out in manufacturing and supply chain. So, do you have a sense as to how you stack up competitively on either design cost, or I guess you have a lot of advantages in manufacturing as you build out and off the top there. Jennifer Rumsey : I mean one of the advantages we have here is we\u2019re able to leverage our existing footprint and capability that we have as a part of the broader comment. So, you saw us announce recently, we plan to use our Fridley manufacturing facility for electrolyzer production in North America. So, we are tapping into that strength we have in our footprint and supply chain capability to help build out profitable both product as well as supply chain. And that\u2019s an advantage that I think Cummins has here. Operator : The next question is coming from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just on the distribution margins. It looks like you guys aren\u2019t expecting margin expansion there, even though sales are up 2% to 7%. I guess what is the reason for that? Mark Smith : I think there\u2019s a little bit of improvement baked into the guidance, but we\u2019ve got a pretty strong track record of improving. There\u2019s no structural impediments to growing margins over time. It\u2019s a range. So, under the different revenue scenarios, some variation, Nicole. But over the time, we expect the margins to keep going up. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, understood. Thanks. And then I guess Power Systems stood out to me. On the other side, it\u2019s just the margins look really impressive year-on-year in 2023. Is price/cost the biggest driver of that, or is there any other big drivers of the margin expansion that you guys are expecting? Mark Smith : I think, certainly, that\u2019s been a big factor, and we\u2019ve got pretty healthy demand locked in now. So, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on that business. We\u2019ve been pleased with the solid results, particularly in the second half of this year, and we just -- we\u2019ve got a very, very strong focus on continuing to drive\u2026 Jennifer Rumsey : For that business, it\u2019s important to keep in mind, you see a very long -- we have a very long lead time on orders. So, as costs accelerated, it took a while for us to pass on some of the price increases to offset that, and that is in part what drove the strong margin improvement from \u201821 to \u201822. Operator : The next question is coming from Matt Elkott of Cowen. Please go ahead. Matthew Elkott : If you can give us a sense of how much of a growth moderation can we expect in the second half? I\u2019m assuming that will be the case directionally because you\u2019ll have the Meritor comps. And also, it sounds like you guys are more cautious on the second half. So, how much of a growth moderation are we expecting? Mark Smith : You can roughly split our revenues 52% to 53% in the first half versus the second half, Matt. Matthew Elkott : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, just one follow-up on the New Power front. It\u2019s been about a year since you guys announced the fuel agnostic engine. So, any update on that and the receptiveness from customers in your conversations? And also, I think back in August PACCAR announced that they\u2019re using your new natural gas engine. So, is there anything new on that front as well? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So, the fuel agnostic platform, just to clarify, that\u2019s being developed as a part of our Engine business. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll launch a full lineup in North America of that product as a part of the 27 EPA regulation. As you\u2019ve seen, PACCAR is integrating and plans to introduce the natural gas version, and we have customers that are very interested in that product, including with renewable natural gas, and we announced partnerships around that. We also announced a memorandum of understanding with Tata late last year on the hydrogen version of that platform. And so really, we see a lot of interest in those platforms, both as a way to improve efficiency of diesel engines and then create flexibility to move to other fuels such as natural gas or hydrogen with the platform and really minimizing the integration pair up that\u2019s required for customers as they move between those platforms. So, we\u2019ll begin to launch those with the natural gas version here, in North America in late \u201823, early \u201824 and then accelerate introduction in the coming years after that. Operator : The next question is coming from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Can you characterize the current mix of investment spending in New Power? Just kind of give us a sense of the key buckets where you\u2019re spending? Maybe you can even give us some guidelines on how much of the CapEx for this year would be attributed to New Power? And then, I think the higher question here is, are you ready to call 2023 kind of the peak of net investment spending for the segment? Jennifer Rumsey : At a high level, the different categories of investment in New Power, of course, there\u2019s big investments happening in electrolyzers, and we talked about the growth and capacity investments that we\u2019re making there. The other buckets include investments in batteries, other electrified components in the electric powertrain and then in fuel cells. So, we\u2019re investing end of the prime mover as well as some of the key components to position ourselves as our current markets start to move to electrified powertrains to be both the powertrain provider as well as provide key components similar to the model we have today with Engine business and Components. You want to talk about allocation of investment? Mark Smith : Yes. So CapEx, probably in the $100 million to $125 million range. So just under 10% of the total for the company in the New Power segment, and most -- more of that\u2019s weighted towards electrolyzers where, of course, we\u2019re ramping up production, albeit using existing Cummins sites, where possible and appropriate. And then, yes, I\u2019d love to call the peak in New Power losses. They\u2019re going to have to peak soon because we\u2019re aiming towards breakeven in 2027 at the EBITDA level. The only caveat is, if there\u2019s a significant change, should we invest in some new capabilities that aren\u2019t part of our current portfolio? That\u2019s not part of our plan today, Noah, but that would be the only variation. Noah Kaye : That\u2019s helpful. And then just to give us some expectations around the cadence of earnings this year, obviously, you\u2019re guiding to EBITDA, not EPS. But thinking about China JV modestly improving, getting better synergies, capture on Meritor throughout the year, but then maybe some offset from potential deterioration in some end markets. So, just any guideposts you would give us on first half versus second half, the EBITDA or even EPS? Mark Smith : No. I mean, by and large, it will go along with the revenue. Unfortunately, we had a tough Q3 in 2022. So that probably gives us the easiest comp, just kind of going through by quarter, and then we started the year much stronger. So ex-JV, I think we\u2019ll have a good first half of the year. The JV will be the biggest single swing factor. When you look at our P&L, I would think -- in the first half of the year, maybe that helps in the second. Q3 gross margins were disappointing. We\u2019ve rebounded well in here in Q4. So yes, modestly expect first half to be stronger all in, unless revenues in the second half change direction significantly from what we\u2019ve guided. Operator : The next question is coming from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tami Zakaria : So my first question is, are you expecting any synergy savings from the Meritor acquisition this year? I believe you were expecting $130 million in total by year three. So, anything this year? Mark Smith : Absolutely. Yes, we\u2019re working very hard on that. I mean personally, along with many members of the Meritor, Cummins team. So yes, and we\u2019ll talk about those as we go along, but yes, we\u2019re feeling confident about that progress towards that $130 million. Tami Zakaria : And some of that is embedded in guidance and assuming -- or would that be incremental? Mark Smith : We\u2019ll try and get as much as we can -- both helps the long-term interest of that business and improve the cost structure. So yes, we expect the results clearly to improve, especially in the Components segment. We\u2019re assuming that\u2019s all in for now. If we get more, then we\u2019ll be happy to report. We won\u2019t get more than $130 million, just to be clear. That\u2019s a year three number, but we\u2019re making good progress. Tami Zakaria : Got it. And so, I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but can you give some color on the embedded Meritor margin expansion cadence for the year? Should it be in the guided 10% to 11%, or does it ramp towards the back? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So, let me just reiterate the guidance that we had within the Components business. We have $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins for the Meritor business, 10.3% to 11% compared to in 2022, that was 7.2%. And some of that is progress on price/cost in that business, operating efficiency as well as synergy cost savings. Tami Zakaria : Got it. Thank you. Mark Smith : I think you should just expect sequential improvement through the first half of the year from the Q4 levels. Operator : The next question is coming from Avi Jaroslawicz [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions on for Steve Fisher. Just in terms of the power generation market, can you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that market to be so robust this year? We might have expected data centers weakening a little bit. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting that to be up still again this year. But, if you could just talk about some of the drivers in that market. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. The power generation market really nonresidential construction as well as data centers, and despite some of the announcements that you\u2019ve seen from our data center customers regarding staffing levels, they continue to show interest in investing in data centers and have demand and drive backup power -- demand on our products in that market. So, we are still quite bullish about the opportunities there for 2023. Mark Smith : I think it\u2019s fair to say, it\u2019s pretty broad-based across multiple markets, broad parts of the economy. Yes, the data center gets a lot of attention. It is a significant individual segment, but we\u2019re seeing robust underlying demand for power generation across multiple segments. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just in terms of the New Power business, have you seen acceleration in the recent months following the IRA in terms of customer interest there? And does that possible acceleration in the market change your view on when we could be breakeven in that business? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. How I would describe it is, the inflation reduction act and the investments around that are really going to be key to enable the adoption rate that we anticipate is going to drive an acceleration in hydrogen investment. The details around that investment are being clarified right now. So, it\u2019s going to take several years before you really see that translate into actual projects and business. Definitely, it\u2019s going to drive growth in the hydrogen market in the U.S. between now and 2030 as that -- as those incentives come in place to both put the hydrogen production in place as well as drive adoption of some of these technologies, which today, frankly, just cost more. So, you need those incentives in order to start to drive customer adoption and bring down the costs and make them more viable in the market. I mean, in the short run, we\u2019re investing more because we\u2019re building up capacity as are others in the industry. So, the faster we go in the short run could consume more cash. But obviously, we want the market to move, and we expect to deliver good gross margins once we get this kind of investment phase. So, it could go faster. It\u2019s quite a long incubation period, so very different from, say, our on-highway engine business, while we take an order. And then typically, we\u2019re shipping in a few weeks. It\u2019s not been that typical in the last 12 months versus sometimes more than a year between headline announcements to actually putting equipment into place and sometimes even more than a year. But we are encouraged, strong adoption for our technology, and yes, business is doing well on the business development side. Operator : We\u2019re showing time for one final question today. The final question is coming from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : When we look at China revenue, the consolidated plus JV in 2022, it\u2019s basically the lowest it\u2019s been over three, four years. I think slightly below 2019. I\u2019m just curious, in those three years, how profitability looks maybe post some restructuring optimization? If units in China recover, are you more profitable in each of those units than maybe you were in the past? Mark Smith : Well, what\u2019s happening over time is that the content is going up, right? So, one thing that\u2019s been a big positive for our business is China consistently adopting more advanced emission standards. So the amount of revenue that we\u2019re selling is going up per vehicle quite significantly over time. And certainly, cycle over cycle, it\u2019s billions of dollars of extra revenue growth a year. We\u2019re just at the lowest market in a decade. So, we agree that that growth rate is modest. We don\u2019t have any signs yet of a rapid adoption. We\u2019ll be looking at the same data you\u2019re looking at, and obviously, taken on board the feedback from our customers, but we are profitable in our operations. We don\u2019t disclose profitability by region, but for sure, when China volumes improve, our profits will go up. Michael Feniger : Thank you. And we\u2019ve seen quite a few emerging suppliers in the EV, e-mobility space really struggled in the last 12 months with deliveries or profitability. Do you see some of those dynamics driving OEM conversations back to you and traditional suppliers as we start looking ahead to some of these key dates and trying to adopt more of this altered powertrain? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. We talked about this in our Analyst Day about a year ago. We expect that this transition is going to take a long time for our industry, and that positions incumbents like Cummins well because you need to invest for the long term. Regardless of what our customers are adopting, we\u2019ve got the solution in our portfolio. And so for sure, you see the benefit of a company like us that has a portfolio of options to meet their needs, it\u2019s going to be around for the long term and continuing to invest in some of these new technologies, be able to do that and support the product as an advantage, and it\u2019s playing out to be more of an advantage as time goes on compared to some of the new entrants. We continue to pay attention to those new entrants though and how they advance the technology and work to enter the market. So, we wouldn\u2019t discount them, but certainly, this long investment period makes it more challenging for them to stay in and be successful. Mark Smith : And I think also our footprint, our reputation for dependability, wherever our customers operate, is leading us to be approached in new segments by global large industrial players. So, it\u2019s not just in the market that we operate in today, we\u2019ve been approached to expand into different market applications. That\u2019s particularly exciting. Operator : At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clulow for closing comments. Chris Clulow : Thank you all for your participation today. That concludes our teleconference. I really appreciate the interest. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call this afternoon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Chris Clulow : Thank you Donna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins\u2019 results for the first quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off. Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. In March, Cummins announced the launch of Accelera by Cummins, a new brand for our New Power business unit. Accelera provides a diverse portfolio of zero emission solutions for many of the world's most vital industries, empowering customers to accelerate their transition to a sustainable future. Coupled with our brand announcement, Accelera shared that it will supply a 90-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system for Varennes Carbon Recycling plant in Quebec, Canada. This will be the largest PEM installation in North America and a key step in advancing the green hydrogen economy. Accelera and Blue Bird also announced, we will increase production of electric school buses more than doubling the zero emission school buses that we've collectively put into operation over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, progress continues to be made on the planned separation of the filtration business. In February, we announced that our filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed underwritten IPO of newly issued common stock. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continue to be strong across all of our key markets and regions with a slow improvement in China, resulting in record revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.5 billion, an increase of 32% compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand, and improved pricing. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% compared to $755 million or 11.8% a year ago. First quarter 2023 results include $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business, while the first quarter of 2022 results include $158 million related to the suspension of operations in Russia, and $17 million related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these costs, EBITDA percentage increased in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, offset by supply chain and compensation cost increases. Research and development expenses also increased in the first quarter of 2023 as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volume, pricing, and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023 and we will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. In the first quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.3 billion and EBITDA of 9.4%. The improvement in profitability from the comparable EBITDA margin of 7.2% in 2022 was driven by improved pricing, operational improvements, and cost reduction activities aligned with our value capture initiatives. Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 39% to $5.1 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 76,000 units, up 17% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 27% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 33,000 units in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022, while our unit sales were 30, 000, up 13% from 2022. We shipped 39,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the first quarter of 2023, down 5% from 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 6% as volumes declined, partially offset by positive net pricing. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 14% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints began to ease. Our international revenues increased by 24% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 16% as on-highway markets began to recover. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 268,000 units, an increase of 2% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were $46,000, an increase of 31% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new product launches to meet NS VI standards. The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2022 levels at 476,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 36,000 units, an increase of 6%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 57,000 units, a decrease of 26% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to the change in emissions regulations and related adjustments and inventory levels. Our units sold were 9,000 units, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in the excavator market was offset by improved share with the new and expanded customer relationships and first quarter engine sales to replenish inventory levels at construction OEMs. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 28% in the first quarter, primarily driven by a decline in data center activity. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $752 million, an increase of 21% from first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 26%, while our shipments increased 7%. Power generation revenues increased by 30% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. In Brazil, our revenues increased 48%, driven by improved demand in most end markets. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenue in 2023 to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 12% to 17%. This guidance reflects an improved outlook in North America, including stronger demand for Meritor. We are forecasting higher demand in heavy-duty truck and power systems markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2022. We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023 compared with our prior guide of 260,000 to 280,000. While supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce, end customer demand remains strong. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. Similar to heavy duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 16% in 2023, an improvement from the previous guidance of up 7% driven by share growth better than expected construction volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the demand in the light-duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with the prior guide. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10%, improved from our prior guidance of a decline of 25% to 30%. While the market is adjusting to new emissions regulations, shipments to replenish inventory and export demand exceed our prior expectations. As we discussed previously, our guidance assumes a slow recovery in demand in China this year. We have continued to improve our presence in the region, through the down cycle of 2022 and are well-positioned for continued outgrowth. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners. We are seeing this in 2023 with improved on-highway share now that NSVI is fully implemented, along with higher share in the construction market as we expand our partnerships. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases in the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up 1% in 2023. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales and mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with the prior guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvement in the data center market. For Accelera, we are expecting full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our prior guidance. Revenues are expected to approximately double from 2022 due to higher battery demand in North America school bus market and the additions of the electronic powertrain portion of the Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. The electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum as well with the near-term forecast on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As mentioned on our previous call, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenue contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be between $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, an increase from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in our previous guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first quarter with visibility to strong demand beyond the first half of the year, we have raised our sales growth outlook for the year to 15% to 20%. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.7% from our previous guidance of 14.5% to 15.2%, reflecting very strong incremental margins while continue to invest for the future within our core business and Accelera. Demand in most of our core markets is strong. Our products are performing well, and we are excited about the investments we are making in the future. During the quarter, we returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Strong execution resulted in record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in the first quarter, despite the continued challenging operating environment. I'm impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our excellent results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect the planet for future generations and return cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter with organic revenue growth of 12%, record quarterly EBITDA, net income and earnings per share, an improved operating cash flow compared to a year ago. Given the strength of the first quarter results and improved outlook, we have raised our full year expectations for sales and profitability. Now, let me go into some more details of the first quarter performance. Revenues were a record $8.5 billion, up 32% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 39% and international revenues increased 24%. Of the total increase, 20% was driven by the addition of Meritor. Organic growth was driven by strong demand for products in all segments and improved pricing. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 2%. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, including $18 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $755 million or 11.8% of sales, including $158 million of costs related to the suspension of our operations in Russia, and $17 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these items, the higher EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, partially offset by increased investment in new products and capabilities. To provide clarity on the first quarter operational performance of our business and allow comparison to prior year and guidance and excluding the costs related to the separation of the Filtration business and the suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Let's look a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $2 billion increased $440 million, but as a percent of sales decreased by 90 basis points, as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive effect of Meritor. Across our businesses, we saw mixed trends on input costs, with the Engine business experiencing some increases, while other segments saw some benefits in freight and commodity costs. Results for Meritor improved from prior quarters due to improved pricing and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $191 million, driven by the addition of Meritor, higher variable compensation and research costs, as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Selling, admin and R&D decreased 110 basis points as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $119 million decreased $8 million from the prior year, with higher earnings from joint ventures operations offset by lower technology fees. In China, we did see higher earnings than anticipated, as truck OEMs increased build rates to restock channels after a very challenging 2022. We not yet seeing signs of sustained improvement in end user demand, however. Other income was $71 million, an increase of $123 million from a year ago. The improvement in other income is driven by a gain of $19 million in mark-to-market investments compared to a loss of $37 million a year ago. We -- also, a year ago, we incurred an asset write-down of $36 million. Interest income and gains on foreign exchange also increased year-over-year in this line item. Interest expense increased by $70 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 21.7%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter were $790 million or $5.55 per diluted share, up 90% from the $418 million or $2.92 per diluted share a year ago. Our strong performance in Q1 continues our trend of raising performance over successive cycles. All-in, operating cash flow was an inflow of $495 million, $331 million higher than the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher earnings. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor all year and it assumes that the operations of the Filtration business will be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs or benefits related to the separation of the Filtration business as and when that occurs. Components segment revenue was a record $3.6 billion, an increase of 79%, while EBITDA decreased from 16.4% of sales to 14.6%, primarily driven by the addition of Meritor. Meritor revenues in the first quarter in the segment were $1.3 billion and EBITDA was $120 million or 9.4% of sales, up from last quarter and in line with our expectations. Components, we expect total 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37%, up 4% from prior year guidance and EBIT margin to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, unchanged from three months ago. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were a record $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 15.3%, flat with a year ago as the benefit from pricing was offset by higher material and variable compensation expenses. In 2023, we expect revenues for the Engine business to grow between 2% and 7%, up 2% at the midpoint from our prior guide, driven by continued strength in the North American truck market and a lower pace of deceleration in the China construction market. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% of sales, flat with previous guidance. And our overall projections for the Engine business include a modest tapering in both the top line and the bottom line in the fourth quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to a record $2.4 billion. EBITDA also increased to 13.9% of sales compared to 9.9% a year ago, driven by higher volumes in both whole goods and aftermarket as well as improved net pricing. We expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10% and EBITDA margins in the range of 11.3% to 12%, and we've raised our guidance for sales by 3% at the midpoint and margins by 100 basis points. In the Power Systems business, we also had a strong quarter with the revenues of $1.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. EBITDA increased from 9.5% to 16.3% of sales driven by higher volumes, strong Parts business, and higher pricing. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 5% to 10% consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 13.7% to 14.4%, an increase of 70 basis points from our prior projections. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market, and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $94 million as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate Accelera revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses to be in the range of $380 million at the midpoint, entirely consistent with our projections from three months ago. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions and end markets, we are raising full year company guidance. We now project 2023 company revenues to be up 15% to 20%, a 3% increase from our prior guidance. Company EBITDA margins are now expected to be approximately 15% to 15.7%, up 50 basis points from our prior projections. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior forecast. As we continue to make the critical investments necessary to bring to market new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash to shareholders over time. And as we said last time, in 2023, our primary focus will be on dividends and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt for this year, whilst we continue to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. In summary, we delivered record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in a very strong first quarter. Our customers are indicating stronger visibility into the second half of the year, giving us confidence to raise our forecast. We will continue to focus on delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies. There is one last matter I would like to bring to your attention. You will see in our Form 10-Q to be filed later today that we have updated our risk factor disclosure related to our ongoing discussions with the EPA and CARB on their review of our emission systems, most notably our pickup truck applications. We understand that these agencies are likely to propose resolving this matter by requesting in the relatively near future that we agree to one or more consent decrees and pay certain civil penalties. We are not able to estimate the amount of these penalties today, but we anticipate that the amount is likely to be material. We look forward to providing additional information on this topic when we reach a resolution. Thank you for joining us today, and now I'll turn it back over to Chris. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. The first question today is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Jennifer Rumsey : Good morning, Jerry. Mark Smith : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Congratulations on a really strong quarter. I just wanted to ask for the Power Systems and Distribution businesses, outstanding first quarter, the guidance is for margins to decline significantly off of the first quarter run rate. Can you just step through? Is that just early in the year, and we want to make sure the results are sustainable, or are there any discrete items that you think declined sequentially for these two businesses? Mark Smith : Yes, we've definitely been asking those questions internally as well, Jerry. Really strong results from both. I think pricing, of course, has been positive. I think in both those businesses, we haven't yet seen some of the cost increases that we anticipated for the full year. We had some beneficial moves in commodities that help power systems. So we're not assuming that they continue. And then in distribution, of course, very strong parts margins, and some lag effect before some of the cost increases take place. So we're still expecting strong full year results. Of course, we'll continue to push for improvement everywhere we can. And again, there was modest benefits from one or two corporate items that improved all of the segments. But I think the main takeaway I want you to leave with, we're really pleased with the performance in particular of those businesses. The Distribution business now has established quite a track record of improving margins over time, and we're really encouraged over the last three or four quarters by the progress in the Power Systems business. So we'll keep pushing for more. But I think one or two factors that we're not certain can continue through the subsequent quarters. And we are trying to drive down inventory a little bit, which may have some absorption impact in the Power Systems business a little. Jerry Revich : Super. Thank you, Mark. And then can I just shift gears, Jennifer, you folks do a really good job of expanding your market share every time we have new regulations. I'm wondering can you just expand on the comments that you folks made in the prepared remarks and just talk about the opportunities that you folks have in terms of potential market share gains as we do see rising content and rising complexity on these engines, particularly within the context of the EPA's electric vehicle plans laid out recently as well? Thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Jerry. So as I commented and you saw start to come through in Q1, our pattern of leveraging emissions regulation change to drive outgrowth in market position as well as added content is playing out in China now following the launch of the NSVI. We've seen that playing out in India with BSVI regulation previously. And we do believe that there's continued opportunity both in the Engine space with future EPA regulations of the ultra-low NOx build rule to -- to some degree, increase our position in the market, although, of course, we have a strong position today in the US market. So content expansion. So that continues to be a tailwind and outgrowth opportunity slowing to some degree in North America on-highway, but there continues to be upside there. And then we are working clearly in our Accelera business to establish position in the electrified powertrain and in particular, our position in key components and as well as integrated powertrain. So batteries, power electronics and motor generators, eAxles, fuel cells. We feel like we've got the right portfolio of technologies and are forming partnerships and getting experience in the market to position ourselves over time as that market starts to electrify. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Tim Thein of Citi. Please, go ahead. Tim Thein : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, maybe just one on -- to start on the Engine segment. You've taken up the full year revenue outlook and as well as JV income and the margin guidance, I believe, was unchanged. So what's working against the top line there in terms of the profit or the EBITDA guidance? Mark Smith : Yes. In the near term, that's the one segment where we've actually faced more pressure on the cost front, on input cost inflation. We made quite a bit of progress in some of the other areas. So that's probably the biggest single factor in there. The JV income, we're not sure we've got -- found a footing in the market yet, Tim, it was better than we expected in Q1. It wasn't exceptional. It was just better than we expected. But we're just not -- we don't have a clear sight into the improving end user demand. I mean, eventually, that will pick up and that will be an upside. We just don't have visibility to it right now. But basically, that's the one business that's still wrestling with -- I wouldn't say the other businesses don't have challenges, but that's the one that continues to have some challenges on the supply side, and that's the biggest factor. Tim Thein : Got it. Okay. And then, just on -- wouldn't be a Cummins call without an update on China. And you mentioned that on the on-highway side, you've seen a pickup from a production standpoint is not translating yet on the retail side. What just -- what is the team seeing and hearing, not just on the on-highway, but maybe some of the other key end markets for you. You mentioned excavators, but maybe some of the other ones in China and just kind of what's baked in into the balance of the year for the China operations as a whole? Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, I'll start and then Mark can add additional points that he'd like to. But as you -- as Mark alluded to, in the on-highway business, we're forecasting and believe we're seeing a slow recovery in the market and that there was some inventory buildup in the quarter, not significant increase in end user demand to slow recovery and opportunity outgrowth as we've already talked about. In off-highway, in construction, we have the emissions changeover that is negatively impacting the China market, less so than our previous guide, because we've seen again, some stocking up in the channel as well as higher export demand. We continue to see markets holding up in mining and oil and gas. And so, overall, a little bit of upside in on-highway kind of a mixed story and off-highway construction and power gen. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi. Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, Mark, first question, similar to engines, on components too were increasing our sales guidance marginally, but the margins are unchanged. So what would be the reason behind that? And then, Jen, I guess, based on what you're saying, it sounds like you're seeing fairly good demand trends everywhere in your order book, is pretty good for 2023. But are there any areas where you're sort of seeing red flags? And in the event of a recession or downturn, how do we think about decrementals, or is there any other self-help that Cummins could do to sustain higher earnings, assuming the macro weakens? Thank you. Mark Smith : Yes. I think, Jamie, I think components continues to do well. The main factor is just really the mix in the business. The underlying businesses are performing well. Again, not such a big help from price/cost in this segment relative to power systems and components. But I think really it's really some minor changes in the mix going forward. We've obviously got strong North America. Meritor continues to improve, but it's still dilutive to that overall segment, but no fundamental . Jennifer Rumsey : And I'll just add, I mean, from a margin performance perspective, we're really focused on improving the Meritor business performance consistent with what we said when we did the acquisition, driving the incremental margin improvement across our other core businesses and then scaling up investing in a sustainable way and moving towards breakeven and Accelera business. And so we're paying attention to those -- each of those items to track that we're driving towards our targets. In terms of the broader picture, Jamie, to your question, the end market demand, order boards, our customers have, the comments that we continue to get from end customers remains fairly strong. Our confidence, as we said, is growing into the second half of the year, and we continue to watch these broader macroeconomic indicators and understand that we're in a cyclical business. And while this hasn't been a typical cycle because of the supply constraints, we are preparing and we'll take action to deliver decremental margins and outperform through the down cycle as we have in the past. So, already this year, we are making investments in key areas for our future, but also limiting investment in headcount growth in other areas and continue to monitor plant operations and operate at the level appropriate for the demand that we're seeing, and we'll continue to watch that closely and adjust as we need to. Jamie Cook : Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Raso : Hi. Sort of picking up on trying to look beyond 2023. I'm just curious, the conversations you're having with your off-highway customers for initial thoughts on what they need from you in 2024 relative to on-highway. Just curious if you have any distinguishing features between those different conversations? Mark Smith : David, is in the construction area or more in the high horsepower markets just to make sure we're answering your question correctly? David Raso : Open question on purpose. Off-highway versus on-highway. Mark Smith : Yes. So I would say on the -- we don't really have -- we haven't given guidance, of course, for 2024. We haven't seen any weakening in the construction markets in North America similar to what we're seeing in on-highway, though we're watching this one closely. I think it's probably a very similar state as we look at construction versus on-highway, cautious probably as we move into the fourth quarter, but good visibility now that that's probably going into the -- well into the third quarter now. Jennifer Rumsey : And I'll just add, of course, in China, you talked about the emissions changeover. So, there's a dynamic in that market and a question on does China do any action in the economy there that we'll pay attention to. And in Power Systems, same in terms of broader macroeconomic indicators I'm watching that, but we do have places where we're starting to take orders into 2024. And so it's a space that we're just watching closely at this point. David Raso : I appreciate that. And people also are just curious about truck historically hasn't been the best market for maintaining price. But it's also been a pretty unique pricing power era we're living through right now. So, I'm just curious how are you thinking about or what are the early conversations like for 2024. I'm not saying if you have to give back price, there can't be commensurate offset and lower cost for you. But just trying to think about pricing in isolation, what are the initial conversations for 2024 given the pricing levels where we've been coming up to the last 12, 18 months? Jennifer Rumsey : Well, we have emissions change overcoming in some of our markets in 2024. So, of course, that's a factor. But what I would say is we have long-term agreements with some of our customers. We price more regularly with some other customers in the market. We're continuing to pay attention to what's going on with price costs. As Mark said, it's still a mixed picture. And so we're committed to continuing to deliver strong returns and stay on top of price cost as that moves. But right now, this year, we're seeing improvements in some areas, and we're still seeing inflationary pressure and other areas. So it's a little bit difficult in -- 2024, yeah. David Raso : But for price -- I'm just curious, any price concessions. When we hear some component suppliers, or I mean they were even being asked for concessions mid-year because I guess the answer would be why not if you're the OEM. But I'm just curious more structural for 2024. Is -- are we getting some price concession request? Should that be a base case and then it's about getting the cost down even more ideally? Mark Smith : I think there a lot of factors go into pricing, David, included in input costs, agreements with customers, supplier available. A lot of those things, but that's not a main topic conversation right now at all. I think the thing we're most thinking about is the -- how long does this cycle run on and off-highway and right now, customers are telling us their confidence for the rest of the year is, on average, has gone up, not stayed the same. We recognize and appreciate the same questions really about demand levels for 2024. That's our radar is mostly upon any signals around demand. That's going to be the biggest driving factor of our performance. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wertheimer : Almost just following up on that question with maybe a slightly different plant. Your businesses where you, I think, have more pricing control and distribution power systems did really well at margin. And the OEMs that you serve and on-highway truck have had a really good quarter as well. Just overall, is your general sense that you're pricing to those OEMs and components should catch up over time, and there's still your runway to go, or is that too strong? Mark Smith : Well, first of all, we can't really -- we can't -- we're not aware of all the dynamics of the OEM pricing. That's really their business. We really have to look at the costs and the performance of our business. The other thing that's going on within our margins, of course, quite significant investment, we've got a lot of new products that we're excited about, and some of our customers are excited about. So the engineering cost of elevated. So that is the other factor that's really particularly in the engine components. I'm going to accelerate everything new and doesn't come with an enormous amount of revenue today. But in the engines and components, we have secured more business for the future, right? And we're planning to secure even more with the new technologies that we're bringing forward. We're price cost positive for this year. That's clearly a factor in our results, so where we can get pricing, we will do that. Aftermarket, there's obviously a stronger source of pricing for us generally, Rob. But I think looking at the margins, you've got to take into effect, how much are we investing? Because I think how much others are investing is also a signal about who's investing for more growth. And right now, we are putting more into the engineering across the business because we're excited about the future. Rob Wertheimer : That's a helpful answer. Thank you. And if I can -- I think I've asked this before, I am not \u2013 easy to answer, but in Accelera, how should we think about as revenue start to ramp, what margins do? I mean are project level economics going to be consistently positive on the margin line and maybe not more be. Are you still bidding loss-making deliveries as your volumes to come through? How do we sort of think about what the underlying dynamics are of the margin there? Mark Smith : I think there have been some higher fixed costs on the battery electric side. And then on electrolyzers, we are going to expect to have positive gross margins as we ramp up. And then we've stated previously that based on our current strategy, we're aiming to get at or around EBITDA neutral by 2027. So yes, as revenues go up, we're going to expect to see those losses clearly come down over time. And we've got -- we're building momentum on the sales, particularly yesterday, the Q1, most of the sales growth was on battery electric, excuse me. But as we've talked about recently, the electrolyzer backlog is really -- I won't use the word accelerate, has picked up quite a lot. And so we're bullish about that. But yes, very focused on the margins as the volumes come up. Battery is a little bit higher fixed cost rate. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Ishan [ph] on behalf of Tami. Congratulations on the great print. My first question is, are you preparing to ramp production assuming 2025 or 2026 could be pre-buy years ahead of the emission regulations in 2027? And then if I may ask a second on -- sorry, if I may ask a second on Meritor as well. Are you able to pass on cost inflation as anticipated, or are customers pushing back? Thanks. Mark Smith : Yes. So what I'd say is we are making planned investments because we're -- irrespective of the economic cycle, we're expecting to pick up more business. So we're increasing capacity in parts of our business and launching new products. The nature of our business is such that we have to be prepared to ramp up and ramp down based on the economic cycle. So it's hard to predict with great certainty two or three years out. But as a general statement, yes, our CapEx is up this year because we're kind of bullish on our longer-term prospects. And then on pricing cost, of course, it's always competitive and challenging. But I think we're all aware that there's been significant inflation across the industrial space over time, and that's what's really necessitated the price increases and quite frankly, earlier on in the cycle late in 2021. It took us a while before we were able to increase prices. So to an extent, we've been kind of catching up with the trends there. Yes, so that's an ongoing\u2026 Jennifer Rumsey : You saw some of that as Meritor specifically reflected in the EBITDA improvement. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just follow up, if I could, on the EPA and CARB legal situation that you mentioned, if there's any color on the potential timing of resolution that you can offer? And then I know this is obviously sensitive and I suspect you don't want to negotiate with yourself on a conference call, but just how to think about framing the size of what this might be? Is this something that might be in sort of the multi-hundreds of millions of dollars? Is this something that you could fund within your just ongoing cash flow and might it affect any other investment plans or spending plans that you might have? Jennifer Rumsey : So, first, thanks for the question. I do want to start by saying that Cummins is fully committed to emissions compliance. We have been and we'll continue to cooperate with agencies all along and work through this matter to the best of our abilities. And our updated disclosure today is consistent with what we've done since we first announced our voluntary internal review in 2019 of disclosing transparently throughout this process. So, as Mark said, we think that we are nearing the end. It's premature to speculate though exact timing or exact amount at this point. We feel like the business is well positioned in a strong financial position and continuing to generate strong returns. Steven Fisher : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I'm wondering, just to follow up on some of the price versus cost discussions. Are you able to actually quantify the price versus cost kind of cadence for this year and sort of the margin cadence for the rest of the year? And I'm thinking about the whole company, but if it makes sense to talk about highlight any specific segments, that would be helpful. Thank you. Mark Smith : Well, in first quarter, we were about 2% net positive between price and cost. And as we said on the -- in the earlier remarks, it very much varied by business. And in fact, you can see it, since you're asking a lot of questions about the different margins in the business, you can see that. I mean, the pricing is pretty much set. Aftermarket is one area where we have the potential that were just prices more frequently. That's the nature of the aftermarket business. I don't think that's unique to Cummins. But pretty much, I think, the course is largely set for this year and then, it's really looking for efficiencies in every part of operations, working with customers, working with suppliers. We all enjoy it when the costs are lower. That's just not where we'd be. It's been an unprecedented period of supply constrains, some of which, frankly, we're not out of yet and it's been a period of unprecedented complexity and very, very robust demand. And we've continued to grow our business faster than some of the underlying markets. So that's been a positive, but that\u2019s been a lot of work for our supply chain teams. But I think, largely, it's going to be a net positive for this year, Steve. I don't imagine dramatic changes quarter-to-quarter. The commodities can ebb and flow a little bit, and we saw some benefit copper prices in the Power Systems business. And again, we're using hedging and other techniques to try and smooth out those costs. But I don't expect fundamental changes to the reason for variation in earnings. We're really focused on this demand side. And right now, our confidence has gone up based on the confidence of our customers through the rest of this year. Jennifer Rumsey : And just to keep in mind as context here. Over the last couple of years, as we saw that rapid increase in demand, there's really been two factors at play with the inflationary pressure and supply challenges. So one is cost versus our ability to pass that on a price, and we made a lot of progress through 2022, and you see that continue in 2023 to offset the inflationary pressure and then it's operating leverage. And because of all the supply disruptions we didn't see in those early quarters, the normal operating leverage that we would, and that has also improved and is reflected in some of the numbers that you see in Q1. So just to give you a sense of what that's like for us now in our Rocky Mount Engine Plant, which produces midrange engines. Last year, our on-time delivery from our suppliers was at 60%. In Q1, it was at 70%. And historically, we would expect something closer to 80%. And so that plays out in operating efficiency for us in our plant. So, it's improved. There's still a little bit of opportunity. But running at the rate that we are, we are continuing to be constrained by a couple of our supplier components. I'm shocked we've made it this far into the call without asking -- anybody asking me about supply chain. Yes, chips and electronics have improved, but they're still operating at capacity, which means small disruption hasn't impacted. But overall, underlying operating leverage has improved. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Elkott of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Matt Elkott : Good morning. Thank you On the rail side, wondering if you see any potential long-term content opportunities from the new locomotive rule that California issued on Thursday, which includes mandates on freight, passenger, and industrial locomotives. So, if it stands and goes national, there could be a big build cycle as well as a lot of new technology upgrades. Is there any opportunity for you guys from that? Jennifer Rumsey : It's still early for me to add a lot of response here. We, of course, now are in the passenger rail business with our 95-liter engine. We have a Tier 4 compliant product, and then we've also entered the rail market with certain customers with fuel cells. And so we'll continue to explore opportunities with the product offerings that we have in that market. Matt Elkott : Got it. And just one higher level question in light of your strong results and improved outlook. Do you see this bifurcation between your strength and the strength of the machinery sector as a whole on one hand and the rest of the economy being weak? Is that nearly a function of just catching up the demand from the last two and a half years or so while disruptions hampered production levels, or is this -- you mentioned, Jen, that this is not a typical cycle. Is there something more than that, more than just catching up the demand? Jennifer Rumsey : Well, there is -- I mean, definitely, what you said is a factor, limitations in supply and high use, right, at high use and then new products are more fuel efficient. So, there's still a lot of factors that are causing customers to -- in commercial trucking to continue to want to buy. There's investments in infrastructure that's driving demand and construction and there's growing investments in the cloud, it's driving data center demand. And so there are some specific indicators for our business that maybe are decoupled from the broader economy. That said, the broader economy does have some influence, which is why we continue to be cautious about where we're making investments and increasing headcount. Mark Smith : We do -- just like you as an observer of other parts of the economy and sometimes wonder at the rate of hiring and resources being added into new areas, and then you get retrenchment. And sometimes, that's very different from the business model that we operate in. We work with very efficient customers. A lot of efficiency is the focus, right, even when some growing are going through strong cycles in other sectors of the economy, you see some very different dynamics that just don't translate well to what we have experienced. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we have run out of time for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clulow for closing comments. Chris Clulow : Thanks very much, Donna. Before we conclude, I want to turn it back over to Jennifer for a few closing comments. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Just to wrap up today, I want to again recognize the strong performance of the company in the first quarter, delivering record revenue, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share. We're in a strong financial position and are confident in our strategy and our leaders in the future of the company and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in future calls. Chris Clulow : Thank you. That concludes our teleconference for today, and thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Our host for today's call is Chris Clulow, VP of Investor Relations. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host. Chris, you may begin. Chris Clulow : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the second quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On April 3, United States President, Joe Biden, visited company facilities in Fridley, Minnesota to tour Accelera by Cummins, first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers, a key technology to produce no-carbon hydrogen. Accelera is initially dedicating 89,000 square feet of the existing Cummins power generation facility in Fridley to electrolyzer production with the opportunity to expand to meet the growing demand. Accelera also reached a further milestone of electrolyzer order backlog totaling over $500 million at the end of the quarter. The Fridley facility will help address that growing demand, along with other capacity being added globally. Lastly, progress continues to be made on the separation of the Filtration business. On May 26, Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ATMU in connection with its initial public offering. Upon the completion of the IPO, Cummins retained approximately 80.5% of Atmus outstanding shares. The Atmus IPO generated $299 million of net proceeds and Atmus added $650 million of debt. Cummins realizes the benefit of the IPO proceedings and the debt issuance as Atmus will hold the debt at full separation. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter of 2023. Revenues for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 31% compared to the second quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% compared to $1.1 billion or 16% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results include $23 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. This compares to second quarter 2022 results, which include $47 million in recovery of amounts reserved related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia, offset by $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 15.4% in the second quarter of 2023, represented a slight decline from the 15.7% we delivered in 2022, principally due to the addition of Meritor activity, which currently has a lower gross margin percentage than our other businesses and increased SG&A and development expenses. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volumes, pricing and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. The strong EBITDA performance of the business in the first half drove an increase in selling and administrative expenses versus the prior year as we recorded higher accruals related to our variable compensation plans during the quarter. Research and development expenses also increased in the second quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.2 billion and EBITDA of 12.2%. The improvement in the profitability from the first quarter EBITDA margin of 9.4% was driven by pricing to cover inflation, operational improvements and cost reduction activities, which more than offset material cost increases that we expect to persist through the second half of the year. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 31% to $5.3 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 77,000 units, up 11% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, also up 11% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 34,000, up 27% from 2022. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the second quarter of 2023, flat with the 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 8%, driven primarily by positive net pricing. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 16% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 32% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago, with the addition of Meritor and a strong demand across most markets. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 37% and as markets began to recover compared to a very weak second quarter of 2022, which was impaired by COVID shutdowns in Shanghai and other regions. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 279,000 units, an increase of 61% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 63% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new products launched to meet the NS VI standard. The light-duty market in China was up 21% from 2022 levels at 460,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 28,000, an increase of 23%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 51,000 units, a decrease of 23% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weaker activity and construction. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 5%, driven by improved share with new and expanded customer relationships for both domestic and export usage. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 8% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a decline in the data center market. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $724 million, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 2%, while our shipments increased 1%. Power generation revenues increased by 75% in the second quarter, driven by strong economic activity and customer demand ahead of a July 1 emissions regulation change. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full-year 2023 revenue guidance of up 15% to 20% versus last year. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.7%. We now expect stronger revenue and profitability in both our Power Systems and Distribution segments than we did three months ago, offset by increased cost in the Accelera business. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023. Supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce and while end customer demand remains strong currently, our current guidance forecasts lower industry truck production in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are projecting the market size to be 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units. Similar to heavy-duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. However, through the rebalancing across our global plant efforts to improve the supply base, we have been able to increase our production, resulting in the improved outlook. The improvement in the medium-duty outlook was offset by decreases in our forecast for two other markets. North America construction is now expected to be down 10% to flat versus our previous guidance of flat to up 10%. Secondly, Brazil truck is expected to be down 30% to 40%, a decline from our prior guidance of down 10% to 20% as the market adjusts to Euro 6 equivalent emission standards. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be $140,000 to $150,000 in 2023. Volume levels in line with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increases. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the light-duty truck demand coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for our products, including the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas powered by the end of 2023. In the short time since we launched our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volumes to be flat to down 10%, in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, an improvement from our previous forecast of about 1%, propelled by stronger power generation and on-highway sales. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horse power markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, an improvement from our previous guidance of down 5% to up 5%. Revenues in global power generation markets are now expected to increase 15% to 20%, up from our previous guidance of a 10% to 15% increase, driven by non-residential construction and improvement in the data center markets. For Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our previous guidance. As noted in my highlights, the electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum with our near-term focus on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As we scale up to serve the electrolyzer opportunity, continue to develop our products and support our customers in the field, costs are running higher than originally projected for the year. As a result, we have revised our EBITDA guidance for Accelera to an expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023 versus our prior guidance of $370 million to $390 million. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first half where we produced record revenues and record EBITDA while delivering for our customers, we are maintaining our guidance of sales up 15% to 20% and EBITDA of 15% to 15.7%. Demand in most of our core markets is strong, while we continue to closely monitor global economic indicators. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins will remain in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our shareholders. Our guidance for the full-year implies weaker revenue in the second half of the year. While demand remained strong in several markets, a weaker outlook in China versus the first half, an expected decrease in the North American heavy-duty truck production in the fourth quarter and the previously mentioned North America construction and Brazil truck decrease are some of the factors driving the lower second half run rate. In view of the lowered forecasted revenues in the second half of the year, we expect to manage our operating expenses below the second quarter levels. During the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Shortly after quarter end, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.57 to $1.68 per share, the 14th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. The strong execution from the first quarter of 2023 continued into the second, resulting in record sales and strong profitability despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. I want to thank our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our customer relationships and navigating continued supply chain constraints. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operational performance, investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were a record $8.6 billion, up 31% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 31% and international sales increased 32%. Our organic sales growth rate was 12%, driven by improved pricing and strong end market demand for our products globally, with a balance of 19% increase in sales driven by the addition of Meritor. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1% overall. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% of sales for the quarter, including $23 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion or 16% of sales, including a one-time $47 million benefit related to the adjustment of our reserves as we suspended our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and the impact from Russia year ago, EBITDA in the second quarter of this year was 15.4% compared to 15.7% a year ago. Lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by the dilutive impact of Meritor, higher variable compensation costs, which showed up largely in our SG&A line and in higher development spending. To provide clarity on operational performance and comparison to guidance and excluding the costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the impacts from Russia in my following comments. Now let's look in more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 25.6% last year. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased by 70 basis points as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive impact of the Meritor acquisition and higher variable compensation expenses. Our Cummins Meritor business continued to show improvement in the second quarter and is performing in line with our expectations for the full-year. In fact, most of our businesses delivered gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.3% of sales compared to $892 million or 13.5% last year. The increase in expenses was driven by the addition of Meritor, net of realized synergies, higher variable compensation, higher development costs as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Income from our joint ventures was $133 million, up $38 million from a year ago due to a slow recovery in demand in China. Other income was $24 million, an improvement of $42 million from a year ago. In the second quarter last year, we incurred $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans, and those did not repeat this year, which largely explains the change in other income. Interest expense increased by $65 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and also rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 22.3%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share compared to $702 million or $4.94 a year ago. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $483 million, $116 million lower than the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher working capital associated with the higher sales. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor and assumes that the operations of Atmus will be included in our consolidated results for the full-year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs and benefits related to the separation of the filtration business. Components revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 76%. EBITDA percent decreased from 18.2% to 14.7%, with EBITDA dollars growing from $355 million to $504 million, both the big driver of the growth in EBITDA dollars and the decline in the percent was the addition of the Meritor business, which added $1.2 billion in sales and $152 million or 12.2% of sales EBITDA. For the Components segment, we expect 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, in line with our previous guidance. Within components, Meritor revenues are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion and EBITDA in the range of 10.3% to 11%, consistent with our previous guidance. In the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were $3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.2% compared to 15.2% in 2022 due to higher development spending and higher variable compensation costs linked to the stronger overall performance of Cummins year-over-year. In 2023, we project revenues for the engine business will increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA expected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5%, unchanged from our prior year guidance. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $2.6 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% a year ago. We now expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15% and EBITDA in the range of 11.7% to 12.4% with sales increasing 5% from our prior outlook and margins up 40 basis points, extending the track record of margin expansion in this business. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $1.5 billion, an increase of 21% and EBITDA increased by 58%. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA rose from 10.6% to 13.8% of sales, driven by higher power generation volumes and improved pricing. We have an intense focus on improving the results of the Power Systems business, and this has yielded clear margin expansion over the past year, and we see much more potential for earnings growth going forward. Results for the second quarter include $18 million of costs associated with actions that we have taken to drive further improvement as we seek to transform the long-term earnings power of this business. In 2023, we expect revenues for Power Systems to be up 8% to 13%, an increase of 3% from our previous outlook. EBITDA is now projected to be 14.3% to 15%, an increase of 60 basis points from our last forecast. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $114 million as we continue to invest in the product infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million, unchanged from our previous outlook. And loss is now expected to be in the range of $420 million to $440 million, an increase of $50 million in those losses as we increase the level of resources dedicated to successfully ramp up and meet growing electrolyzer demand. As Jen mentioned, our full-year outlook for the company is unchanged. We maintain our previous guidance with revenues expected to be up 15% to 20% and from last year and EBITDA margins in the range of 15% to 15.7%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior outlook. In 2023, we will continue to focus deploying cash to reinvest in our business, grow the dividend and reduce debt. In summary, we delivered record solid profitability in the second quarter of 2023 with a key feature being the improvement in the gross margins in most parts of our business. In the second half of the year, our focus remains the same, delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in lower carbon technologies. Our guidance does imply lower revenues in the second half of the year, and we will manage our operating expenses below second quarter levels accordingly. Thank you for your interest today. We delivered solid second quarter and continue to make good progress in executing our strategy. Now let me turn it back over to Chris. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question. Operator : At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We are now ready to begin. Our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. One, the engine margin, I\u2019m just trying to understand. They were a little weaker than I thought. I understand there\u2019s some compensation and investment in there, but your JV income was really high as well and margins in the back half versus the first half were lower. So can you just help us understand what\u2019s going on, on the engine margin side and how to think about, like, what\u2019s required in investment over the longer-term? And does that continue to weigh on the engine margin? And then my second question, Jen, just bigger picture. I know you don\u2019t want to guide to 2024 \u2013 for 2024, but I know you\u2019re very close with your customers. So as you look out in 2024, given some of the industry forecasts that are out there, which markets are you more after this [indiscernible] markets that you\u2019re getting a little more cautious that we could see declines? Thank you. Mark Smith : Okay. I\u2019ll go with the first question, Jamie. Thank you. Yes, so in the Engine business, there are really three themes to the numbers. One, we\u2019ve raised the investment level in engineering, really to support all the additional business that we\u2019ve won and meet future emissions and drive that profitable growth. Two, this is the business, more recently, it\u2019s continued to face some continued inflation on material costs. We\u2019re net pricing positive, but we\u2019ve also continued to experience some increase in material costs. And then for the second half of the year, really, we\u2019re expecting China JV earnings to weaken, which is typical having a weaker second half than the first half. And then yes, as you mentioned, the incentive compensation \u2013 we\u2019ll describe it as an issue. It is a factor in our results across the company in that our performance is exceeding our internal plan and we trued up our accruals in the second quarter, which happens from time to time and also compares to a quarter a year ago when we were lowering them. But the business issues are really the increased investment and then the lower JV earnings in the second half of the year. Jennifer Rumsey : And on your second question, Jamie, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the market, the performance of our products continues to be very positive and strong. And what I would say is my conversations in the \u2013 in recent months have continued to have conversations with customers, in particular in the medium-duty space, and even in the electrolyzer space, there\u2019s a lot of demand and interest in Cummins products. And I noted that we\u2019ve made some shifts in our global plants to increase capacity and medium-duty for North America to meet that demand. So there\u2019s still really strong demand in that market. And we\u2019re cyclical business. We\u2019re used to being a cyclical business, I think this is going to likely be a more gentle cycle across markets than what we\u2019ve typically seen, but we do see some indications in certain markets, a little bit softening in aftermarket, some anticipated down days and our guidance implies heavy-duty a little bit lower in the fourth quarter, in particular, construction a little bit lower. And China, really not growing significantly, seasonally softer in the second half versus first half. So I still feel quite good about market outlook and how we\u2019re performing. And yes, we think the Q2 is going to be our revenue peak and we\u2019re \u2013 our guide reflects that and we\u2019re taking actions to make sure we\u2019re prioritizing the places we need to invest for the future while also managing headcount discretionary spending and just SG&A down for the second half of the year. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Mark Smith : Thanks Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mark Smith : Hey, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Jennifer. Hi. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about the interest that you\u2019re seeing from your customers in alternative fuel technologies. Over the course of the quarter, we have the positive EPA mandate essentially for a landfill gas, given the changes in the RIN structure. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing from your customers on interest in the 15-liter engine in North America specifically for that product. And any other comments that you would add on internal combustion hydrogen or other moving pieces, based on the visibility on the regulatory side? Thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, as you noted, I think there\u2019s growing interest in what I call some of these bridge technologies, alternate fuels and engines, the natural gas product, we\u2019re seeing growth in that in China. We\u2019re going to launch that here. We expect to see some success in that market and looking at hydrogen engines where we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re developing those and trying to figure out in which markets they\u2019ll play a role. It\u2019s slow going because of the infrastructure build out that\u2019s required. And so we\u2019re really focused on investing to have the right products, but at the right time. And so you\u2019re still going to see a lot of demand for diesel in the next few years. One key thing that happened this quarter was progress with the car regulation and the alignment now to EPA in \u201827, which is a real positive. So we could focus on a nationwide solution and then some of these bridge and zero emission solutions to start to adopt and applications and places where the infrastructure exists. Jerry Revich : Super. And Mark, can I ask within components, your EBITDA margins were up a touch sequentially 2Q versus 1Q, given just all the different piece in the portfolio between Meritor and Atmus. Can you just talk about how the different parts of business are performing? Mark Smith : Yes. I think in that business, they\u2019re all performing well. Obviously, the change in the mix has an impact, but clearly, Meritor results stepped up from the first quarter. So that was probably the biggest thing to change. I don\u2019t want to talk about Atmus. They\u2019re going to have their own earnings call shortly. But I would just say in general, the performance trends are strong across that portfolio. Jerry Revich : I thought I\u2019d try. Thanks. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jerry. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is open. Tim Thein : Thank you. Good morning. The first one is on power systems. I\u2019m just curious if maybe you could give an update there on anything of note within the order boards. I\u2019m guessing that as you walk through some of the end markets, a lot of the revisions were to the upside. And yet, if you look at the second half revenue growth, there is a slight step down from the first. So I\u2019m just curious, is that a capacity issue or has there been any changes in terms of, some of the individual end markets. Just curious, your thoughts on that. Mark Smith : Hey, Tim, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. I think the only market change, which isn\u2019t new this quarter that\u2019s been coming for a few months has really been a weakening order board on some of the consumer side, particularly the RV market where we\u2019ve got a very strong presence, not surprising with interest rates where they are that overall market started to \u2013 the demand started to drift down. So I would say that\u2019s the only one with some momentum change. I mean, oil and gas, there are different opinions at different points in time. That\u2019s the one clear trend I would say right now. And then you\u2019re right. The backlog is seeing us through this year. So we\u2019re watching everything closely. But I would say, it\u2019s stable outside of RV. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. And the thing we\u2019ve been able to do, we had a lot of supply challenges in that business last year. So through the first half, we\u2019ve been able to really produce at a better level. And we see strong demand in particular data center demand, the order board is out through next year for the data center market. We revised \u2013 you heard us revise mining up a little bit. So we\u2019re seeing strength in parts of those markets. And then as Mark noted, it\u2019s a little bit of softening in other parts of that market. But the situation there is really stabilized from where it was last year. Mark Smith : And then, of course, we\u2019re pleased with the step up in performance over the last year. And then you heard in my comments that we\u2019ve taken yet more actions to keep boosting that profitability up. So we\u2019re very pleased with the momentum in that business. Tim Thein : Yes. Okay, good. And just \u2013 and then on distribution. So the \u2013 and maybe tying back to, Jen, to your comments on aftermarket activity. But if you look at parts had been in the kind of mid-40% as a percentage of distribution sales and it stepped down. I imagine there was some mix headwind associated with that, but \u2013 and maybe just is there an area worth calling out, typically that business can kind of be a good early warning signal? So maybe just a little bit more color on what you mentioned earlier in terms of that? Jennifer Rumsey : No, I mean, the color I'll give there is, we were at incredibly high aftermarket levels because what was happening was customers couldn\u2019t buy new trucks. So they were using trucks longer that drove more aftermarket demand. And so it\u2019s still very healthy. We believe we\u2019ve seen some \u2013 we\u2019re seeing some inventory adjustment happening. And that the overall aftermarket demand has come down a little bit, but it\u2019s still very, very healthy to your point, the aftermarket business for us from our margin perspective is a favorable one, but we still see it being healthy is what I would say. Tim Thein : Got it. Mark Smith : A bit more signs, it\u2019s leveling off than accelerating, I would say, Tim. Tim Thein : Yes, okay. Thanks for the time. Mark Smith : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi, thank you. The comments about truck production in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little more color on that in the sense of magnitude? How much is this your perspective versus already been laid out by your customers? And how to think about sort of dovetailing that into conversations for pricing for 2024? Mark Smith : So I would say, first of all, it\u2019s a shorter quarter just because of the holiday periods. I think the industry has a lower build rate building at Q4, so that\u2019s not coming specific. And then, yes, I think the rest is our assumption, David. It is not current outside of the shorter quarter. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re hearing from customers at this point in time. The question is really going to be what are the order momentum for the rest of this year and what\u2019s sentiment as we get towards that end of the year? That\u2019s how I would characterize what we\u2019ve got embedded in our guidance and that doesn\u2019t change. We\u2019ve had that instance the start of the year. David Raso : That\u2019s what I was trying to figure out. Have you heard a tone change? Nothing to do with less production days. Just truly daily line rates being communicated. Hey, we\u2019re taking it down in the fourth quarter or so just your view. I\u2019m just trying to make sure we understand\u2026 Jennifer Rumsey : It\u2019s a tricky one. And as you can imagine, we are debating this a lot. So as I said, a little bit softer aftermarket is typically an indication that we\u2019re going to see some softening in the market more down days in the fourth quarter. There\u2019s just uncertainty from an economic perspective and the typical cyclical nature that we see in our markets that is causing us to anticipate in the fourth quarter. And as we look to next year that the market size is going to start to come down a little bit. As I said, I think it\u2019s a softer cycle than we would typically see, but it just \u2013 it\u2019s at a very high level right now. We \u2013 our Jamestown is producing as much as they can. Mark Smith : Yes. We\u2019re not trying to signal some Cummins specific issue here, David. It\u2019s just assumption about the market activity at the end of the year. David Raso : That\u2019s fine. And the question on pricing? Mark Smith : Can you repeat that, David, sorry. I don\u2019t think I pick it up. David Raso : The conversations for 2024 on pricing, and I know you have supply agreements, but just trying to get a sense of \u2013 and you might be able to take your costs down as much, but I think people are just trying to figure out, is there some price give back after the last 18 months or so very strong price increases. And I just want to see if you could provide some perspective on early conversations you\u2019re having for your truck engine pricing? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, look, we\u2019re \u2013 our goal is to continue to balance the price with the cost pressure that we\u2019ve been seeing, which is stabilized. And then we\u2019ll launch some new products next year as well. So that will allow us to continue to have those conversations with customers, but really nothing dramatic there. David Raso : Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Smith : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Robert Wertheimer : Hi, I also had a question on price and then maybe just generally on the truck market and your market share and mix developments. So the first one is truck OEMs have had some really good success in margin as prices have gone up. I\u2019m actually just a little bit curious mechanically, when a customer walks in to buy a truck, and they choose either Cummins Engine or the OEMs engine, you don\u2019t control the price of that engine at retail, right? So, maybe, I guess, in effect, the truck OEM would be making margin on the increased price of the truck and engine. Is that the way to think about it? And do you still have catch up to come there? Jennifer Rumsey : Correct. We don\u2019t control the pricing that happens to the end customer. We have long-term agreements and we price our engine and powertrain solutions and options to the OEM. And we typically follow those long-term agreements with metal market adjustments and have done some inflationary adjustments with them over the last few years, but we don\u2019t fundamentally dictate that pricing to the end customer. Our goal is to have a product offered to work with the end customers to create goal for our product through the performance of our powertrain compared to others in the market. Mark Smith : We made a big shift away from influence in retail price 20 years ago. Robert Wertheimer : Okay. No, I think that\u2019s clear. And then just a big part... Jennifer Rumsey : I was going to say, of course, in the heavy-duty space, a big factor and customer choices as fuel economy. Robert Wertheimer : Got it. Second one is just trying to get up to date on mix shifts in North American truck and how it flows through for Cummins. So, if long haul truck declines in vocational/day cab come up and I guess medium-duty comes up. I\u2019m just trying to sort out, which of those are market share/mix negative for you and not? So is your market share in long haul higher than your market share in vocational, or I guess your market share in medium-duty quite high? So I\u2019m just trying to think about how the evolving mix in the truck market affects Cummins? Mark Smith : Yes. I mean, the main delta in all those things is \u2013 whilst our share has gone up in heavy-duty over the last couple of years and it\u2019s very strong. Medium-duty, it\u2019s much stronger, right? That\u2019s the main difference. And then I would say it\u2019s a different kind of angle to your question, Rob, the larger fleets, we tend to have higher share with the larger fleets than we do with the overall \u2013 within heavy duty than the overall market itself because that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got those deeper, stronger relationships. So there\u2019s a theme that\u2019s been support as larger fleets are becoming more effective, more competitive. That\u2019s been a trend that\u2019s been helping us. But individual take and we\u2019re really getting into splitting as the trend has been shared going up in heavy and in medium. Robert Wertheimer : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. So, can you update us on your price realization and price cost assumptions for the year? Mark Smith : Well, yes, we\u2019ll be at about 3.5% to 3.75% plus on pricing. And on costs, we\u2019ll be about 1.5% inflation. Tami Zakaria : Got it. And on your full-year guide, I\u2019m just trying to understand, the segment sales guide was raised for both distribution and power systems, but the full-year guide was unchanged. So can you help me bridge that? Mark Smith : Yes, we really \u2013 well, Chris, why don\u2019t you go? Chris Clulow : Yes. So, yes, Tami, you\u2019re right. We did raise in power systems and distributions. And as we looked at the overall guide, just given the uncertainty in the markets we elected not to change the overall, it probably would trend towards the higher end of that revenue guide is what we\u2019re looking at right now, but we didn\u2019t want to change it at this point. Tami Zakaria : Okay got it. Thank you so much. Mark Smith : I think construction, though, construction and Brazil truck were the two key areas. And then I would say parts, it\u2019s not dramatically different, but it\u2019s leveling out. Those are the three themes that are going \u2013 go in the other way or not improving. Tami Zakaria : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the truck market messaging again. I have the sense that you guys were getting increasingly confident about the business for 2023 and thinking that 2024 might not be too much of a downturn, if at all. So has that thinking changed at all? And was that aftermarket trend you mentioned sort of, like, a catalyst for different thinking, or is it more just something in the macro that\u2019s gotten your thinking changed, or is it not really changed at all? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 it really hasn\u2019t changed notably from the thinking before and that this idea that we\u2019re going to see a gentle cycle. So, some downturn in the market, not dramatic and anticipating that, that happening. And it\u2019s really dependent on some of these broader economic things and what really happens, how that plays out. Mark Smith : I think it\u2019s correct that the forecast for the industry are a lower Q4, right, just because of the number of the production days in the quarter. Part of it is just math for the remainder of the year, which is not. And then part of it is just history tells us if there is some erosion in confidence, which we haven\u2019t seen in customer orders. Just to be clear, if there is, we tend to have a bigger fade into the December holiday period and a slow ramp up. So we just \u2013 we built that into our guidance at the start of the year. That\u2019s simple as that. Jennifer Rumsey : But in the meantime, layered on that, what you\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re improving gross margin across the business, right? The base business gross margin performance has been strong, Meritor has continued to improve quarter-over-quarter. And we think now is the time to start managing our operating costs, expecting that we\u2019re going to see some downturn and then continue to look at places as you\u2019ve seen us do some structural things to improve the business and the focus this year has really been within the Power Systems business where we\u2019re doing that. Steven Fisher : Okay. And it sounds like part of your second half outlook is a bit weaker trend in China. How are you thinking about the potential for stimulus there? And whether there\u2019s any chance for upside still that might come out of that? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. At this point, we\u2019re continuing to assume there\u2019s no stimulus. There was, in a meeting, a few weeks ago, well, the \u2013 I think the government recognizes that they want to try to improve the economy. They want to do it and fiscally responsible stable way. And so we\u2019re not assuming stimulus. China is playing out pretty much as we anticipated some improvement off of a very low 2022 and typical seasonality between first half and second half. And if there\u2019s stimulus that comes in that impacts demand that would impact our outlook as well. Mark Smith : Yes, but I would say that just seem the most likely size source of upside to our guidance right now. Steven Fisher : Got it. Thank you very much. Mark Smith : I\u2019m worried about it. Just looking for more and there is much sign of it right now. Steven Fisher : Right. Makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Elkott with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Matthew Elkott : Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you guys still expect EBITDA neutral for Accelera by 2027, or are there any emerging new structural costs and investments needed that could change that timeline? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. We are still \u2013 with the strategy we have in place right now, we continue to work towards the EBITDA neutral in 2027. A big piece of that is this electrolyzer revenue growth as you saw with the comments on backlog that we continue to be confident in the outlook there and we \u2013 the increased investment this year is really focused on making sure we\u2019ve got the product and the supply chain right to enable us to do that. Matthew Elkott : Okay. And Jennifer, just one more question here on the construction side. The tempered outlook for the kind of latter part of the year, data centers are strong and public sector, non-residential construction is strong. Can you talk about some of the end markets driving a somewhat tempered outlook for construction in North America? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So, our outlook for U.S. construction down to flat, right? So data \u2013 and data centers would show up for us and power generation data center market is definitely strong. There\u2019s parts of the market where construction, infrastructure investment and construction remains strong and there\u2019s other segments of that market with rising interest rates and that we\u2019re seeing things. Mark Smith : Part of it is just a timing issue of like what\u2019s the replenishment of the fleet been a lot of ordering of engines for construction equipment. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s just the demand on us is kind of leveled out, right now. And again, we\u2019ll see where that is going. Matthew Elkott : Does any of the data center construction market, does any of it show up in the \u2013 in construction for you guys, or it\u2019s all most of your exposure to business\u2026 Mark Smith : That\u2019s in our Power Systems segment. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, it\u2019s not a huge factor for us. I mean, the data center factor for us is that they buy these very large gensets for backup power and that drives significant revenue for power systems. The actual construction itself\u2026 Mark Smith : It\u2019s hard for us to track exactly where the construct \u2013 we\u2019re selling to the OEMs sometimes rental. Matthew Elkott : That makes sense. Thank you so much. Mark Smith : Thank you. Chris Clulow : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to expand if I could on Accelera and the increased investment spend this year about $50 million. I think you mentioned a couple of times it\u2019s really to get electrolyzer production and product right. It is an operating expense, right? So is this mainly engineering resources? Maybe you can give us a little color on what you felt you needed to spend on to get ready for this ramp? And maybe you can even put in the context of some of the industry and policy changes that you\u2019ve seen come through, obviously, some significant ones over the last year? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Yes. The industry and policy changes drive that optimism and the outlook and the growing demand, the higher cost of shifts, not capital expenses of the plants as much as it is operating costs in engineering and in customer support as we\u2019re scaling up that product or running higher than we had previously forecasted. Noah Kaye : Okay. So customer support as well as product engineering. All right. That\u2019s helpful. But just to make sure we understand, there\u2019s no change to the revenue guidance. The current book of business, which I think is more weighted towards EV, I mean, is that delivering kind of the expected margin contribution? We hear mixed indicators on EV adoption, particularly in North America, would love to sort of understand where that side of the business is tracking versus your expectations? Mark Smith : Right. So on the EV side, no, our demand today is mostly concentrated in the bus markets. I would say our margins have definitely been improving. The Accelera leadership team has done good work on improving the margins even with, yes, relatively modest, albeit increasing demand at this point in time. Yes, so we\u2019re really looking for those next waves of demand, but the margins have been improving there. And on the electrolyzers, the demand keeps going up. The issue is not demand. It\u2019s just making sure that we\u2019re ready. There aren\u2019t that many electrolyzers, new ones out in the field yet, right? We\u2019re still building that capability. Yes, we\u2019re shipping some, but that\u2019s going to be going up to just making sure history shows a bit of investment now. It pays off multiple times in the long run. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Here\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of things that we watch on this, how the market develops. So on the electrolyzer side, there\u2019s investments, but the actual details of how that government money flows and when it flows are still being defined. So that is a bit of a timing impact on some of that. And then in the electrified powertrain, there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty beyond the bus market where you\u2019ve got cities and corporations that have incentives and want to electrify on exactly how that infrastructure is going to build out. So there\u2019s regulations that\u2019s going to start to drive more of that, but a lot of uncertainty I would say on the exact pace of that. Noah Kaye : Appreciate it. Good to see you making the investments. Thanks so much. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you. Mark Smith : Yes. Thanks, Noah. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Chris Clulow for any closing remarks. Chris Clulow : Great. Thanks very much. That concludes our teleconference for today. Thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Cummins Incorporated second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you, everyone, for your participation. Have a wonderful rest of your day.",

With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details about our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details of our performance, I'm excited to first highlight a few major events from the third quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On September 6th, Accelerate by Cummins, Daimler Truck and Bus and PACCAR, along with EV Energy joined forces to accelerate and localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. The planned joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications, creating highly desirable manufacturing jobs in the United States in the growing clean technology sector. Total investment by the partners is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the 21 gigawatt hour factory with production expected to begin in 2027. We see this partnership as an opportunity to share investment with two long-standing partners while advancing a key technology solution for our customers and industry and collectively to accelerate the energy transition in the United States. In October, Cummins completed its acquisition of two Faurecia commercial vehicle manufacturing plants and their related activities, one in Columbus, Indiana and one in Roman Netherlands. This acquisition is a natural addition to the Cummins Emission Solutions business and will help ensure we meet current and future demand for low emission products. Lastly, Cummins announced several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Freightliner announced they are working with Cummins to offer the new X15 natural gas engine and its heavy-duty Freightliner Cascadia trucks. Also Cummins and Knight Transportation, Inc. announced that the industry's largest full truckload company has successfully tested Cummins new X15 engine in Southern California, using renewable natural gas to realize reductions in nitrous oxides and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. The X15 N, which will launch in North America in 2024 is the first natural gas engine to be designed specifically for the heavy duty on-highway truck application. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international market. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2022 included two months of consolidated operations for Meritor following the completion of the acquisition on August 3rd of 2022. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% compared to $884 million or 12.1% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results include $26 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to third quarter 2022 results, which included $77 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and inventory valuation adjustments of Meritor and $16 [ph] million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 14.9% in the third quarter of 2023 represented an improvement from 13.3% we delivered in 2022. We as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling administrative, research and development expenses and inflation costs. Third quarter of 2020 also included a onetime employee recognition bonus of $56 million. Research and development expense increased in the third quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages for us in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was a record inflow of $1.5 billion compared to the $382 million in the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on our working capital management within the business. I'm proud of our leaders and employees for their efforts in driving down costs and operational focus to achieve this record result for the quarter, and we will continue to focus on strong cash generation moving forward. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 16% to $5.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 74,000 units, up 1% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 18% from last year, reflecting strong demand for our products. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 32,000, up 19% from 2022. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2023, flat with 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 8%, driven primarily by high inventory in the channel. Revenues in North America Power generation increased 15% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 13% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 24% as markets continue to recover compared to a very weak third quarter of 2022. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 243,000 units, an increase of 48% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 36%. In light-duty markets in China, we saw increase of 14% from 2022 levels at 442,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 26,000, an increase of 12%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 40,000 units, a decrease of 30% from 2022 levels. The decrease in market size is due to weaker activity in construction. Our units sold were 7,000 units flat with 2022 levels as increased penetration at new and existing customers offset the declining market. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by slight improvement in non-data center markets. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $730 million, an increase of 13% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 17%, while our shipments increased 23%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 16% due to the second quarter -- ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are raising full year 2023 revenue guidance to be up 18% to 21% versus last year. We are also narrowing our EBITDA guidance range to be 15.2% to 15.4%. We now expect higher full year revenues in our Components segment and higher profitability in our Power Systems segment, offset by decreased profitability in our engine business as a result of softening aftermarket and off-highway markets. We are raising our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 280,000 to 300,000 units in 2023 after a strong third quarter. Our current guidance forecast lower industry truck production in the quarter. While orders remain relatively strong, inventory management, truck component shortages, limiting our OEM production rates and fewer working days are all contributing to our view for the quarter. In North America medium-duty truck market, we're maintaining full year 2023 market size guidance of 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. While we continue to work to increase our production through rebalancing across our global plants and improving the supply base, industry production continues to be limited due to other supply chain constraints. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels in line with 2022. Additionally, we maintain our guidance for North America construction to be down 10% to flat, driven by high channel inventory and softening market conditions. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in light-duty truck market coming off the low market levels in 2022 and that's consistent with the prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the expanding fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas power by the end of 2023. In the short time since launching our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we expect momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. We look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10% in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, consistent with our prior forecast. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, consistent with our prior guide. Revenues in the global power generation markets are expected to increase 15% to 20%, consistent with our prior guide, with the strong performance driven primarily by improvement in the data center and mission-critical markets. For Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million and also maintain our EBITDA guidance of the expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11%. In summary, we are raising our guidance on sales of up 18% to 21% and narrowing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.2% to 15.4%. Our guidance for the full year implies weaker revenue in the fourth quarter. While demand remained strong in several markets, softening in the aftermarket demand, a continued weak outlook in China, continued industry supply constraints impacting North America truck production and inventory management efforts across many markets are some of the factors driving the lower fourth quarter run rate. In view of the lower forecasted revenues, we have initiated actions to reduce costs in our business, particularly in selling and administrative costs. In order to lower costs as we move into next year, we are offering voluntary retirement and a voluntary separation program in select regions and parts of our business for eligible exempt employees. We will continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further action while continuing to invest for our future. During the quarter, we returned $238 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. Our long-term strategic goal is to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. The strong execution from the second quarter of 2023 continued into the third quarter, driving record operating cash flow despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. As we look forward to the opportunities ahead, we have a strong, capable leadership team who will help us successfully navigate an exciting and changing future. Today, I was also pleased to announce several promotions on my leadership team, which will be effective January 1 of next year. First, Srikanth Padmanabhan, currently Vice President and President of the Engine Business, will take on a newly created role of Executive Vice President and President of Operations. In this role, Srikanth will be an important work that will define and drive improvements in how we operate as a company through the energy transition and ensure our success of our operational priorities. Throughout his more than 30 years at Cummins, Srikanth has worked across many of Cummins businesses and regions, and consistently pushed the boundaries of customer-focused innovation to position Cummins as the leading powertrain supplier of choice in the transition to a net zero future. Srikanth is a result and people-driven leader and is the perfect choice to lead this work. Second, Brett Merritt, currently Vice President of On-Highway Engine Business and Strategic Customer Relations will assume the role of Vice President and President of the Engine Business, replacing Srikanth when he takes his new role. Brett has spent more than 25 years in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry and more than 14 at Cummins. The past 11 spent leading and growing On-Highway Business from 800,000 engines in 2012 to 1.2 million engines last year. Brett is an experienced business leader and a trusted partner to many of our key customers, and I'm excited for Brett to lead this segment. Bonnie Fetch, currently Vice President of Global Supply Chain, will assume the role of Vice President and President of our Distribution Business, replacing Tony Satterthwaite., who has been acting as Interim Head of DBU. Bonnie, who previously led supply chain for DBU has led for Cummins global supply chain and manufacturing organization, including Cummins new and ReCon parts business since early 2022, where she led her team in navigating the many complex supply chain challenges as well as improved operational and functional performance. For more than 30 years of experience, including 20 years at Caterpillar, before coming to Cummins, includes General Management, HR and Supply Chain Leadership and makes her uniquely qualified for this role. I'm excited for her to leverage her broad experience to run this segment. This is a period of change for our company, and it's also an exciting one. I want to end by thanking our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet our customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our some relationships and navigating continued supply chain challenges. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operating performance, investing in future growth and bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry, while returning cash to shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 16% and international revenues grew 13%. Organic sales growth was 10%, driven by improved pricing and strong demand for our On-Highway and power generation products. 5% of the total increase in sales was driven by the addition of Meritor. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales for the quarter including $26 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 was $884 million or 12.1% of sales, including $16 million of costs associated with the planned set for [ph] Atmus. And $77 million of our integration and inventory valuation adjustments related to the acquisition of Meritor. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and Meritor adjustments, Underlying EBITDA third quarter was 14.9% compared to 13.3% a year ago. The higher EBITDA percentage was driven by favorable pricing to cover rising input costs and improved logistics costs, partially offset by higher variable compensation associated with the stronger overall company financial performance. In addition, we issued a onetime employee recognition bonus in the third quarter of last year, totaling $56 million. To provide clarity on operational performance in comparison to our guidance and excluding costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the acquisition integration and inventory valuation stats related to the acquisition of Meritor in my following comments. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August of 2022, resulting in one additional month of operational performance in Q3 this year compared to last year. Now I'll go into more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.6% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 22.9% last year. Gross margin increased by 170 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and logistics costs and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.1% of sales compared to $997 million or 13.6% with the increase primarily driven by both higher variable compensation and higher engineering costs associated with new products across the company. Income from joint ventures was $118 million, $48 million higher than the previous year, driven by the receipt of technology fees and slowly improving demand in China, which boosted the operational results. Other income was a negative $7 million or $20 million lower than a year ago, driven by foreign currency translation. Also included in other income was $28 million of mark-to-market losses on investments. Interest expense increased by $36 million, primarily due to highest higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.4%, including $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share, including $26 million or $0.14 per diluted share of costs associated with the separation of Atmus. All-in net earnings in the third quarter of last year were $400 million or $2.82 per diluted share, which included $16 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and $77 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. All-in operating cash flow was a record quarterly inflow of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion higher than last year, driven by solid earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Generating strong operating cash flow remains a key focus area for the company, and we were pleased with the progress in the third quarter. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes a full year of operations for Meritor and Atmus and excludes any costs of benefit related to the separation of Atmus. Guidance also excludes the impact of any cost reduction activities within Cummins in the fourth quarter. As Jen mentioned, we're raising our revenue guidance for the company to 18% to 21%, up slightly from our previous guidance of 15% to 20%, driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA is now expected to be 15.2% to 15.4% compared to our previous range of 15% to 15.7%. And we are also narrowing the EBITDA ranges for most of our business segments. Components segment revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. EBITDA was 14.2%. Back with the prior year, while EBITDA dollars increased from $384 million to $461 million. Meritor -- Cummins Meritor revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, and EBITDA was $129 million or 11% of sales, a significant improvement from last year and in line with our expectations. For the Components Segment, we now expect total 2023 revenues to increase 35% to 40%, a 3% increase from our previous revenue guidance with EBITDA in the range of 14.2% to 14.7% compared to our previous range of 14.1% to 14.8%. Within Components, Meritor revenues are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, consistent with prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11% compared to our previous forecast of 10.3% to 11%. Lots of small changes in the individual segment guidance as we get closer to the end of the year. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA 13.5% compared to 13% in 2022 driven by operational improvements and the impact of the one-time employee bonus in the prior year. In 2023, we project revenues for the Engine business will increase 2% to 7% and consistent with our prior projection and EBITDA in the range of 13.6% to 14.1%, a slight decrease from our previous guide of 13.8% to 14.5% due to a continuing softening in our aftermarket revenues and some weaker demand in some off-highway markets. In the Distribution segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, 13% higher than last year. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 12.1% and compared to 10% of sales a year ago, driven by stronger volumes, improved pricing and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year. We expect distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15%, consistent with prior guidance and narrowing the expected EBITDA range to 11.9% to 12.4%. In the Power Systems business, revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 7%. And EBITDA increased from 14.3% to 16.2%, continuing a trend of last six quarters of improving margins driven by pricing, higher volumes, operational and cost reduction activities have all contributed to the continuing improving performance. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 8% to 13%, consistent with the prior guidance. And we're raising the expected EBITDA to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.3%, up from our previous projection of 14.3% to 15%. Seller revenues more than doubled to $103 million, driven by electrolyzer project delivery, higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the addition of the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business electric powertrain portion of the --. Our EBITDA loss in the segment of $114 million will continue to support strong future growth. Our guidance for the topline and the bottom line [indiscernible] unchanged with revenues in the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses of $420 million to [Technical Difficulty]. Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Our outlook for capital investments is unchanged and expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to [indiscernible]. We will continue to focus on deploying cash to fund investments that drive profitable growth, debt reduction, and returning cash to shareholders through dividend this year. In summary, we delivered strong sales, solid profitability in the third quarter and record operating cash flow. We'll continue to focus on managing working capital delivering strong margins and investing in the products and technologies that will drive future growth. As we indicated last quarter, we see signs of softening aftermarket demand and weaker demand in some industrial parts. These, combined with less production days in the fourth quarter are expected to contribute to lower revenues and profitability. Have initiated some steps to the costs, as Jennifer outlined, and we'll continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further actions. Our priorities in 2023 for capital allocation, as I've said, to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. In July, we announced a 7% increase in the dividend, our 14th consecutive year of quarterly dividend growth. And through the end of the third quarter, we have reduced debt by $390 million. Furthermore, in October, we reduced debt by a further $650 million, consistent with our plans for the year. Thank you for your interest today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning everyone. Mark Smith : Hey Jerry. Jerry Revich : Jennifer, congratulations on the joint venture with PACCAR and Daimler. As we look forward to what that means for Cummins product availability and offering within EVs, can we just expand on that in terms of what's the opportunity to bundle it with e-Axles, battery management systems? And if you could just talk about, is there a plan use the plant to source batteries globally for your customers? Or is this strictly focused on the U.S. initially? Just would love your broader comments. Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So Jerry, I'll add a little bit more color to what we're doing with this partnership. As I said, this partnership is really focused on battery cell manufacturing. So, we have previously been investing and focusing on battery packs, e-Axles, motors, inverters, other key components and integrated powertrains for the electrified powertrain. And together with our partners saw the need to bring production of battery cells into the US and really design what we think is going to be a winning cell solution for commercial vehicles and industrial applications. So, this will be supplied into the battery packs that Cummins will produce. The cell will also go to PACCAR and to Daimler trucks here in North America for their battery cells, really is targeted at the US market. and having a domestic offering that we think will really do the market. And the chemistry here, for this, we will continue to offer battery packs around the world and chemistries, including LSP and NMC. But this one is focused on LFP technology, which, again, together, we think is going to be a winning commercial vehicle battery cell chemistry, lower cost, better durability, less dependency on some of these minerals that can be harder to source and also improve safety. So, really good opportunity for us and also to stay closely connected with those two partners as we're launching these electrified powertrains. Our intent is to offer that battery cell through our packs to other commercial vehicle and industrial applications here in the US as well. Jerry Revich : Okay. It's super. And Mark, can I ask just a shorter-term question on the Engine segment, you folks had pretty solid performance in the quarter and for the year. The reduced margin rate at the midpoint seems like a big step down in profitability implied fourth quarter versus third quarter. Can you just talk about is that a significant production cut, China JV? Or is that just taking the midpoint of the range versus thinking about the broader, maybe higher end potential outcomes? Mark Smith : Yes, I think it's not related to China. It is related to the fact that we're going to have less production days. That's consistent with the industry forecast for lower heavy-duty truck, which isn't a surprise, but that's what we've kind of been projecting for a couple of quarters. The thing that's really changed through the course of the year, Jerry, is the decline in the aftermarket, particularly running through the engine business. No doubt, some of that's related to customers rationalizing inventory. I don't, I think the underlying rate of decline is less than the headline rate because we've gone from a period of everybody trying to keep up with demand and now like ourselves, many companies are looking at inventory levels and trying to right-size. But just to give you a sense within the engine business between the first quarter of 2023 in the fourth quarter, parts revenues are down about 18%. So that's kind of been slipping each time we've looked at it. So that's the one changing trend. I don't think it's foretelling do. I just think it's mostly inventory adjustments. But that, combined with the lower production days, the lower absorption means that, yes, even though the revenues are holding up for the fourth quarter, it's going to be a little bit tougher. And that's one of the reasons, not the only reason why we've decided to initiate the actions that we discussed earlier. We're not predicting like a precipitous decline in our revenues at all. We don't have a visible clearly a leveling off or a slight decline in some areas, but we feel it's prudent both to do the cost reduction actions, continue our focus on cash flow and debt reduction the year that should leave us with the best chances of being very successful in 2024. Chris Clulow : One quick to add, Jerry. It doesn't change our overall guide for engine business, but it is a difference between Q3 and Q4 is our JV income does step down because of license fees timing. So, we had a lot of that happened in the third quarter that steps down about 40 basis points for Engine business margin from Q3 to Q4. So hopefully, that helps. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. David Raso : Thank you. I'm curious, the cost-out decisions. How much is that related to what you're seeing on the horizon in 2024 and if you can give us any insight on what that is? And maybe margins in 2023 being maybe a little more of a, let's say, a heavier lift to expand margins than maybe we see across the machinery space broadly. Just curious how much is it sort of structural to what 2023 is playing out versus what you're seeing in 2024? And obviously, any sense of magnitude the cost outs would be really helpful. Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, David, I'll start and then Mark can add if he wants to add anything. So, as we said, we see that many of our markets have leveled off. We're seeing some drifting down in some of the markets, aftermarket, off-highway. And we are continuing to focus on ongoing improvement and profitability and performance of our business and using softening markets as a further opportunity to take costs out. So, we still see a lot of strength as we go into next year. We're not going to provide guidance for 2024. Today, what I will say is if you look at backlog and heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck continues to look quite strong as you go into the first half of the year. Power generation is very strong. And so we're not seeing any precipitous drop off, but we think it's wise to take some cost-cutting actions here in Q4 and then continue to monitor the situation. And if we need to take further action, of course, we would continue to do that. Mark Smith : And we'll give you a fuller assessment on the next quarterly earnings call about the both the cost and the benefit impact. Of course, what we're announcing today is voluntary actions, so we don't know what the exact take-up is going to be and then our assessment of what is the kind of momentum in markets going forward. There will be some other smaller actions around facilities and other things. But we'll lay that out in detail in the next quarter when we've got a more holistic or hopefully, clearer view of the full year next year. David Raso : That's helpful. Maybe you can educate me on something. I'm a little confused by the comment in the fourth quarter engine margin. And I appreciate Chris' comment about the JV income, how that will impact 3Q to 4Q, but you highlighted a lower parts impact benefit in the fourth quarter. But then when I see the Components business, which, obviously, has a lot of parts as well, it seems like you're implying a strong fourth quarter on margins for components. So, can you educate me on why the difference one division is getting hit on parts and really the parts division you would think for aftermarket, even more so components, is having a step-up in margins in the fourth quarter, at least appears to be\u2026 Mark Smith : The size of the parts business in the engine business is significantly bigger than the size of the aftermarket business in the Components. David Raso : Sure. I think difference one step down and one step up. And maybe I'm just doing the math right, but it seems like the component implied fourth quarter margins pretty strong? Mark Smith : Yeah, I think it's pretty stable. I think that's just the dynamics we're seeing between the two different businesses right now. Jennifer Rumsey : Well, both of those segments are anticipating lower volumes for North America, medium- and heavy-duty truck market in Q4 for the reasons that I outlined here. Frankly, there's a combination of focus on inventory reduction and supply constraints that are continuing to prevent OEMs from building to the full demand, and we expect to see that in Q4 impact our revenues for both of those segments. David Raso : All right. Thank you very much. Mark Smith : There can be some differing customer demand for Components and engines in any given short-term period, David. I think you're right in the longer run or medium over multiple quarters should correlate pretty well. But in this case, we're seeing a bit more pressure on the parts on the engine side. It's not all parts that are sourced directly from our Components business. That's the main part. David Raso : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Hey, I have two. One is just on the parts destock that you have mentioned and that makes sense. I'm just curious if you have any sense as to how much channel inventory people carry if you're all the way through that, half the way through. If you just quantify that potential if you're able to? Mark Smith : It's a little hard to say would say what we tend to see more clearly on the Power Systems side is destocking almost every year into the fourth quarter. We are seeing some of that and some lower rebuilds, particularly in the slice of the oil and gas market that we supply, Rob. But I would say the engine -- on the engine side, the on-highway side, the seems to have been a more sustained multi-quarter approach. And I think part of that there was a focus on prioritizing OEM newbuilds, first-fit build as we started to ramp up through the cycle and wrestle through supply chain. And then the parts was in catch-up mode, and now we're finding truck utilization has leveled off. Everybody is trying to do a better job on the inventory management. It feels like it's -- we're getting towards the bottom of that right now. Of course, that always depends on what's the economic environment and what's the underlying level of truck utilization. So if you were to ask me today, do I think we're on a clear trend to have significantly lower parts in Q1? I'd say no. So it feels like this is the strongest step has been in the last three quarters with the information that we have right. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. And then if I can ask kind of a bigger picture question in China. It's obviously been very weak for a lot of industrials. Maybe it's bottomed in all your end markets maybe in some. I wonder if you could just give just your high-level view of what's going on in the economy there, whether fleet dynamics mean you have to be in recovery mode, whether that's true of trucks or power gen? Or just maybe give an overview of China, what you see in different parts of your business on the recovery? Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah. So when we look at the China market, I mean over economic activity has continued to be pretty weak there. We've seen improvements in 2023 compared to 2022 when they were heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns even more extreme weakness. So you've seen some improvement. We've seen the strong demand for natural gas heavy-duty engines because of the cost delta between natural gas and diesel there. We've kind of come through the emissions change over in an on-highway market. And so if we see recovery and continued recovery in the economy there, so I think that will continue to positively impact our business. And with the product investments that we've made, the emissions change, we'll have more content, and we think continuing to increase our penetration. So we'll watch and see if any of the government stimulus does start to drive positive momentum and the economic activity, but it's been relatively weak this year. Mark Smith : Yeah. I mean just to give you a sense, I know we don't like talking about months, but July was like the lowest in a decade, right, in some of our JV production. It's crept up since there, but it has been tough. Again, it's not worse than we thought, but that just gives you a sense of how weak it was in the summer. Hopefully, there's upside from here, but we don't have good visibility to that. Chris Clulow : Yeah, the RMB1 billion bond that's planned, I think that's encouraging to see the government moving that won't impact fourth quarter, but hopefully, it drives more infrastructure growth in next year. We'll wait and see that we're up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. So I just wanted to ask about the Power Systems business. Margins came out really strong. Sales growth is strong as well. But when we look at the fourth quarter guide, it seems like you're guiding to a step down of almost 200 basis points sequentially. So just wanted to get a sense of what's driving that? Is this conservatism? Or is there something that we need to be aware of for the fourth quarter for the segment? Mark Smith : Right. So the good news is they've been performing really well. So that's the underlying, and I think that's -- we expect that to be a continuing trend. As I mentioned earlier, typically, we see, particularly with the industrial side of that business that the customers really dropped down the purchase of parts in the fourth quarter. That's not new, but that that typically happens every Q4, and that's probably the main factor there -- the main negative factor. Otherwise, the underlying demand is strong. There's no major changes to pricing or the cost structure. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That's very helpful. And the next question is R&D spend. The R&D spend over the last five years have stepped up notably. How should we think about that spend, let's say, in the next couple of years, and any color on that? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, Tami, as you noted in a period of increased R&D investment that we think will position Cummins well for the future. So in particular, now through the 2026, 2027 time frame when we launch these new fuel-agnostic engine platforms, we're making a major R&D and capital investments, and those are bringing new customer business to us and also will position us to have leading products through the energy transition. We've also been increasing our investment in the Accelera business as we ramp up the product investments for our electrolyzers and see growing demand for electrolyzer volume as well as in the electrified components. So that's really what you're seeing come through in the R&D line. And then we're continuing to really focus on improving underlying performance and efficiency in other areas so that we can continue to make the necessary R&D investments. A \u2013 Mark Smith : Yes. And that's why we've had a big push on the SG&A and continue to do that. So well, on gross margin. So we can grow margins, grow investment, grow the bottom line and keep improving the cash. That's a simple formula that we're working to. We'd like to see the cash flow come up. The engineering is going to remain these higher levels for a little while yet. And it's also the new engine business platforms are contributing to the -- yes, CapEx being higher in dollar terms. It's in our expected range as a percent of sales. But for the next couple of years, we've got these renewal of these major platforms, which is important for our future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Tim Thein : Thanks. Good morning. The first question is on Power Systems. And I'm just curious about kind of the visibility that you have looking into 2024. And backlog isn't something that we historically really talked about with Cummins, but just given the long lead times for large engines and just visibility you have from a rebuild perspective, can you just maybe speak to where you think you exit the year in terms of -- again, I know you're not giving 2024 guidance, but just any sort of help you can give in terms of what kind of revenue visibility you would expect to exit the year with in that business? A \u2013 Mark Smith : Yes, you're right, Tim, that there is more visibility, but long lead times and the underlying demand. Certainly, I think we've got great visibility through the first half of the year. And of course, we're seeing -- we're anticipating more pressure on the on-highway side just because not a severe downturn, but generally, market participants are expecting some moderation in heavy-duty truck orders going into next year. So we would expect more revenue headwinds on the engines and components side. Distribution, as you know, is very heavily aftermarket-driven. So absent some massive crush in the economy, that should be more stable. And then Power Systems, certainly, very strong visibility through the first half of the year and some into the second half of the year. We haven't seen a dramatic shift in trajectory at this point in time. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean we're continuing to, as Mark said, to watch the Power Systems markets and in the industrial markets, we have seen a little bit of softening in oil and gas, which is a relatively small market for us that's kind of its inverse. And so that has softened a little bit. And then in Power Gen, you see a lot of growth this year. And I expect continued strong demand in the data center market for our business, and we're well positioned there. A \u2013 Mark Smith : And it's encouraging that both Power Systems and distribution now are on multi-period margin expansion trends that serve us well going forward. Tim Thein : Yes. Okay. And then just a lot of discussion here in terms of the on-highway parts business for you. And again, I know it's probably a bit of apples and oranges, but just listening to the commentary from your largest customer and kind of the outlook there they have for their own parts business. What do you think -- again, I know you don't want to speak for them, but what do you think is the -- you mentioned down 18%, I think from the beginning of the year. I think they're down like 2% or 3%. What do you think is driving that invariability between you come in to experience versus at least some of the OEMs? And yes, I know that the businesses don't align perfectly, but presumably, their impacted by a lot of the same dynamics. Just curious how beyond that. A \u2013 Mark Smith : Generally, I think it's destocking, right? We've had -- we have -- there's obviously, we know returns levels and things like that from all parts of our channel have gone up as customers have been deep. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I think it's really important to note through this cycle, two very different dynamics because of the supply constraints than what you would previously see. So the aftermarket demand was really strong. And with the supply constraints, it was challenging for some of our customers to get parts. And so there was a lot of focus on building up inventory to try to buffer against those constraints and a focus, frankly, on addressing the gaps that resulted in an overbuild of inventory. So now that some of those supply challenges have eased this getting inventory back to appropriate levels has been a focus, and that's driven a drop-off beyond just the actual aftermarket demand in service. And then the same is true and happening on the first-fit build that we've had supply constraints that have limited our ability to meet industry demand and you see that resulting in the markets holding up longer than you would typically see and continue to see solid demand for first-fit trucks. A \u2013 Mark Smith : And then if I just step back from the noise in this kind of correction period, Tim, clearly, our market share in North America on-highway markets has gone up noticeably so that should all go well for the parts that will inevitably be purchased through Cummins. I just think just in this correction period. I was just trying to provide that extra color this time to explain what I think a short-term margin influences, but not long-term market trends. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Just curious about how much visibility you have to on-highway engine pricing going forward at this point into 2024. I guess to what extent is your pricing going to be dependent on the pricing of your OEM customers or how independent can that be? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, we were price cost favorable this year, as we've shared previously, and we have -- we're continuing to focus on pricing with new product launches and where we've seen inflationary costs coming through. So we're working to continue to maintain that positive price/cost ratio. And we're seeing some slowing of course, in pricing in the market, but we'll expect to continue to have some of that. A \u2013 Mark Smith : Right. And again, when we give out for next year, then we'll, I'm sure you'll ask us about price cost. We'll be happy to share the dynamic. Steven Fisher : Sure. Yes. Thank you. And then can you expand a little bit on your comments on the construction outlook? I think you cited inventory adjustments in North America, but maybe you can just talk about the broader global view of engine demand for construction applications and how you think the setup there is for 2024. Is there sort of a demand question or is it just sort of near-term inventory management? A \u2013 Mark Smith : I think part of it can be the age of construction fleets, right? So we're seeing a drop off in engine demand. That doesn't necessarily mean a dramatic shift in North America construction activity. The three biggest markets both in North America, China and Europe, I think generally, it feels like the pace of economic growth in Europe is slowing. In China, it surprised us a little bit that the construction equipment demand hasn't fallen even further given some of the trails in the overall kind of financial health of construction sector in China, but it has come down some. But yes, no clear picture yet going into next year, I would say, that of all the markets, we still got some tire kick in to do, Steve, to figure out where we land for next year. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will be from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Noah Kaye : Yeah. Thanks. You indicated some favorable testing around the X15 and coming to market next year. So just would love to get a little bit more color on your expectations for demand there, the extent to which this could be a driver of share gains and where you're hearing the sort of the strongest indicators of demand for that product? Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah. So we'll launch the X15 here in North America next as you heard me say, it's performing well in China. We'll have a US version of that, of course, meeting the regulatory requirements here next year, and we'll have availability now through two of our OEMs. And we are seeing end customers testing and interested in that product will have the only heavy-duty natural gas product offered here in North America. So of course, that creates some opportunity for us as customers where they've got infrastructure, environmental goals or even operating cost benefits associated with natural gas will start to adopt that solution more. So there's some opportunity there for sure. Noah Kaye : Okay. And then I think we'd love to get a catch-up on the electrolyzer backlog and quoting activity. Any change in the trajectory there? Anything you noticed during the quarter? And can you update us on where you're at in terms of building out capacity? Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah. Really, on the same trajectory we've talked about previously with building up manufacturing capacity here in the US and Europe, continuing to have backlog growing. We are in the process of commissioning a 25-megawatt electrolyzer with Florida Power and Light over the course of this year. So another big project that we're delivering this year, and we continue to ramp up that business as we described previously. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Chris Clulow for any closing remarks. Chris Clulow : Thank you very much for your interest today. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for calls and answer any further questions that you may have. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Chris Clulow : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins\u2019 results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statements in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentation, are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and then I'll finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. As I reflect back on 2023, I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on being a global leader in clean energy technology and innovation. We made significant progress in achieving our Destination Zero strategy and it continues to be clear that this dual path approach to reducing greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of our products is the right approach to meet our customers' needs today and continue to grow our business and impact. We did this by advancing our core business as well as developing new zero emission solutions through Accelera by Cummins. Most notably, for our core business in 2023, we committed to investing more than $1 billion across our US engine manufacturing network to support the industry's first fuel-agnostic engine and platforms, as well as unveiled the X10 fuel-agnostic series launching in North America in 2026. Additionally, we initiated several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine, which will launch in North America this year and further enables our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. This is the industry's first natural gas engine design specifically for heavy duty and on-highway truck applications, offering customers the opportunity to realize reductions in nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. We are continuing to see strong interest from both OEMs and end users ahead of the launch later this year. In our Accelera business, we announced a joint venture with Daimler Trucks and Buses, PACCAR, and EVE Energy to accelerate and localize battery self-production and the battery supply chain in the US. We further announced this quarter the selection of Marshall County, Mississippi for the 21-gigawatt-hour factory that is expected to create more than 2,000 US manufacturing jobs with production anticipated to begin in 2027. Accelera also reached a further milestone this year of electrolyzer order backlog, totalling over $500 million. In order to meet the growing electrolyzer demand, we began production at our first US manufacturing location for electrolyzers in the Cummins Power Generation Facility in Fridley, Minnesota. Lastly, we are resolute about the leading role we play in the energy transition, and emissions compliance continues to be a critical element of this work and central to our values. We were transparent about this in December when we announced that we reached an agreement and principle to resolve US regulatory claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines, primarily used in our pickup truck applications. After 4.5 years of working diligently with the regulators, reaching an agreement was the best way for us to achieve certainty on this matter and move forward with certifying our new products and advancing our Destination Zero strategy. We have expanded and strengthened our emissions compliance program to help ensure our products comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations around the world. Our product compliance and regulatory affairs organization, which we launched in 2019, has a reporting line directly to me and positions come as to meet global product compliance requirements and deliver solutions for our customers that are safe and lead to a cleaner environment. Now I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for this quarter totalled $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% compared to 2022, driven by strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% compared to positive $1.1 billion or 14.2% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to a voluntary retirement and separation program, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. This compares to the fourth quarter 2022 results, which included $19 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5%. EBITDA dollars increased from a year ago as increased pricing and higher volumes more than offset increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs. Research and development expense increased in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the engine, components and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong at $1.5 billion compared to $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on working capital management within the business. 2023 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, 21% higher than 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales compared to $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales in 2022. 2023 results include $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, the voluntary headcount reduction program I noted previously, and $100 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to our 2022 results, which included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and $81 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 compared to $4 billion or 14.2% of sales for 2022, as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling, administrative, research and development and inflation costs. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in the distribution, components and power systems segments. Our Power Systems business in particular finished 2023 with a full year EBITDA of 14.7% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2022. This segment completed the first year of their focused business transformation effort, and the improvement in performance is encouraging. You will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. In addition to our segments, Meritor finished 2023 with full year EBITDA of 10.8% of sales, up from 7.4% in 2022, as our employees did a tremendous job of executing value capture opportunities across the business. I'm very pleased with the performance of Cummins Meritor to date as we continue our program to improve margins in that business and expand its global reach. In addition, operating cash flow for 2023 was a record of $4 billion, a significant increase from $2 billion in 2022. I'm proud of our leaders and employees efforts in 2023 as they helped deliver on one of our primary focus areas. Strong cash generation will continue to be a top priority moving forward. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2024 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2024 guidance continues to include Atmus for the full year, but excludes any costs or benefits associated with the planned separation of that business. We are forecasting total company revenue for 2024 to be down 2% to 5% compared to 2023, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales, as we anticipate slowing demand in some of our key regions and markets, particularly North America heavy duty truck. Early in 2024, we expect the heavy duty market to continue at its current rate, which is slightly off the peak of the first half of 2023, with further softening in our forecast in the second half of the year. Industry production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2024, a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. In medium duty truck market, we expect market size to be 140,000 units to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat compared to 2023. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 units to 145,000 units in 2024, a 5% to 10% decline year-over-year as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024. We're projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy duty and medium duty truck demand, and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in light duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and moderating export demand. Despite this slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we expect to see continued strong performance for the 15 liter natural gas engine as we achieved approximately 20% share for 2023 in the heavy duty market. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect a 5% to 15% decline year over year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, while the small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines, is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $450 million to $500 million, compared to the $354 million in 2023. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months, as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow, excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims. 2023 was also a record year for EBITDA, net income, and earnings per share. While 2023 revenues were at the high end of our expectations, we anticipate moderating demand in North America truck production in the second half of 2024. We expect this moderating demand to be partially offset by a strong power generation market, resiliency in our distribution business, given the strong aftermarket presence, and improved Accelera sales. In addition, we are taking steps to reduce costs, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. As I close, I would like to officially announce that our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 16 in New York City. I look forward to further discussing our strategy and expect invitations to be sent out shortly. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark? Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I will acknowledge I have a heavy cold this morning. So if I sound more dour than usual and a little rougher, please take that into consideration. We delivered solid operational results in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for revenue and delivering EBITDA margins in line with our guidance. Compared to 2022, our full year sales grew 21% and our operating cash flow more than doubled to a record $4 billion, reflecting the strong focus of our employees on meeting customer demand and improving working capital. Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion and EBITDA was a net loss of $878 million, or negative 10.3% of sales. For the full year, we reported revenues of a record $34.1 billion and EBITDA was $3 billion, or 8.9% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we recorded a one-time charge of $2.04 billion in Q4 to settle the previously disclosed US regulatory claims. Fourth quarter results also included $42 million of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year, compares to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a total of $81 million in the previous year. Full year 2022 results also included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2023 full year operational performance of our business, I am now excluding the costs associated with the regulatory settlement, voluntary retirement separation programs, planned separation of Atmus and the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 8%, driven by improved pricing across multiple end markets and stronger demand for power generation products. International revenues increased 13%, driven by strong global power gen demand, particularly for data centers. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5% of sales a year ago. Improved pricing was offset by higher compensation costs, increased investment and development, and capabilities in our Accelera segment. Higher variable compensation costs were driven primarily by stronger operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the full year. Now I'll go into each line item with a little bit more detail. Gross margin was $2 billion or 23.7% of sales, an increase of $201 million or 30 basis points from the prior year. The improved margins were driven by favourable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $154 million or 15% as we continue to invest in the development of new products that will drive future growth and also due to higher variable compensation costs. Joint venture income increased $25 million due to slowly recovering demand in China from a low base in 2022. Other income was $50 million, an increase of $17 million from a year ago, primarily due to the recovery of technology fees from customers in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $92 million, an increase of $5 million from the prior year driven by higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was negative 13.3%, principally due to non-deductible costs associated with the regulatory settlement. All in net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion or negative $10.01 per diluted share, which includes $2.04 billion or $13.76 per diluted share of costs associated with the regulatory settlement, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.5 billion, $642 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven by strong earnings and a lower expansion of our working capital across the business. For the full year 2023, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, up 21% or $6 billion from a year ago, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Meritor results and strong organic growth. Sales in North America increased 22% and international sales increased 20%. Within those numbers, organic sales growth was 12%, driven by improved pricing, strong global demand for power generation products, continued strength in the North American truck market, and slowly improving economic conditions in China. EBITDA for the year was $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion or 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes, favourable pricing and logistics costs, and a modest and favourable mark-to-market impact from investments that underpin our company-owned life insurance plans, all of that partially offset by higher compensation expenses. All in-net earnings were $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share a year ago. 2023 net earnings include $2.04 billion or $13.78 per diluted share of costs related to the regulatory settlement, $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs related to the voluntary separation programs that we implemented during the fourth quarter. Full-year cash from operations was a record inflow of $4 billion, doubling from a year ago as a result of higher operating income and much lower expansion of working capital across the company. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1.2 billion, in line with our forecast, and an increase of $297 million from 2022, as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the fuel agnostic platforms within our core business. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders, and over the past five years we've returned 56% of operating cash flow in the form of share purchases and dividends. In 2023, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments and dividend growth, returning $921 million to shareholders via the dividend, and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor. We currently expect that our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will mirror those of last year. I'll now summarise the 2023 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2024. If I need to say it again, I will, that the results that I'm going to discuss going forward exclude the costs related to the separation of Atmus, the cost associated with the voluntary retirement and separation, and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in 2022. Component segment revenues were a record $13.4 billion, 38% higher than the prior year. EBITDA was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.2%, an increase of $540 million, or 40%. For 2024, we expect total revenue for the components business to decrease 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.9%. For the Engine segment, 2023 revenues increased 7% to a record $11.7 billion and EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, compared to 14.3% a year ago. In dollar terms, EBITDA increased $74 million or 5%. In 2024, we project revenues for the engine business will decrease 2% to 7% due to expected moderation in the North American heavy-duty truck market, most likely in the second half, or most prominently in the second half of the year. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. In the distribution segment revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $10.2 billion and EBITDA increased by 28% and improved as a percent of sales to 11.8% compared to 10.6% a year ago. We expect distribution revenues to be between down 3% and up 2% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.4% for the full year. In the power system segment, revenues were also a record at $5.7 billion or 13% higher than last year. EBITDA was 14.7% or 250 basis points higher than 2022 driven by favourable pricing, strong volume and certain cost reduction actions. In 2024 we expect Power Systems revenues to be down 3% to up 2% and EBITDA in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. Accelera revenues increased $354 million in 2023 with a net loss at the EBITDA level of $443 million. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues and now we anticipate that Accelera revcenue will increase in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to reduce to between $400 million and $430 million as we continue to make targeted investments in future technologies, whilst improving the operating performance of our current products. We currently project 2024 company revenues to be down 2% to 5% and company EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 15.4%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024 excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will likely be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and strong operating profits in 2023. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a strong focus as we enter 2024, enabling us to continue investing in new products even during times of economic uncertainty, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Jen indicated, we do expect moderation in several of our key markets in 2024, especially in the US truck market as reflected in our guidance. We have already taken actions to reduce costs in the business and are in a good situation to navigate the economic cycle and improve our cycle over cycle performance in 2024. Subject to our mark-to-market conditions, our intention is to split the remaining ownership in Atmus through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation as we seek to reposition our portfolio for the future. As part of the proposed exchange offer, common shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of Cummins' stock for shares of Atmus common stock subject to the terms of the offer. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as in the coming days. Our guidance for Cummins for this year assumes the inclusion of Atmus in our consolidated results for the entirety of 2024 and excludes any costs or benefits of the separation. The benefits to Cummins are expected to include a lower number of shares outstanding upon completion of the exchange. We will update our guidance as and when the separation is completed. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. Jennifer, Mark, Chris, so normally when you folks have new engine regulations, we tend to see higher margins from you folks. I know we're a couple of years out from the 27 regulations, but can you just share some high-level thoughts? It looks like the average selling price of the engine could double given that embedded warranty increase and I'm wondering if you'd just comment on that and then broadly just talk about the parameters of how do you expect the dynamic to play out for your business compared to the margin expansion we've seen on prior emission cycles where you folks have increased your value add. Thanks. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, thanks for that question, Jerry. So as you've seen from us in the past, as we launch product with new emissions regulations, typically we see a content increase, of course, and then also look at creating value for our customers and have an opportunity to price accordingly with them. So we are looking to continue to do that as we launch new products, in particular, these fuel agnostic engine platforms. Of course, we also typically see a bump up in our warranty costs because we are beginning to accrue in at a high rate until we've demonstrated capability of that platform. So that's the other factor to watch as we launch those products, but what you see us doing right now is really focusing on improving operating performance of the business, as well as investing in the key platforms for the future that we believe will bring value to our customers and position the company for profitable growth. Jerry Revich : Okay, super. And then can I ask separately, given the high logistics costs that the industry saw in 2023, can you comment on where your labor hours per unit stand today versus normal? And to what extent could that be a source of upside relative to the guide? Chris Clulow : Yeah, Jerry, I think that has been, as we've progressed through 2023, continue to drive more and more efficiency. Some of the supply chain hiccups that we have experienced are beginning to iron out, we're getting better on time to delivery, and that does allow us to drive more efficiency in our plants. So I think we are continuing to see that as we progress through the latter half of the year. As we expect, as both Jen and Mark mentioned, volumes to particularly in the North America heavy duty truck space come down a bit and moderate a bit, we can continue to drive those efficiencies. So I think the cost per labor hour will continue to get better and I would say the overall costs on labor have somewhat levelled out. We went through, as you know, a long period of them rising and through the course of the last six months that has settled down and become much more of a flat. Mark Smith : Yeah, I would say in the near term, there's a little bit of increased anxiety about events in the Middle East and some shipping delays and some reversing of the trend we've seen in logistics costs, which have been actually going down for us, Jerry. I don't want to overstate that, it's obviously is a little bit of a concern in the near term. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Please proceed. Tim Thein : Maybe just one bit of a clarification, but on the comments on for engine shipments in North America for on highway, I think you said 140,000 down 5% to 10%. Is that -- was that relative to the total North heavy and medium duty market, or was that a comment just on heavy duty in terms of? Mark Smith : Yeah, on the medium duty, Tim, we had a down, down 5% to flat, and that's 140,000 to 150,000. The heavy duty market, we have it down at 10% to 15% and that's our guide for the year. Jennifer Rumsey : And I'll just give a little color. This has been an unusual cycle, I think, in the '21, '22 timeframe and supply constraints that prevented the industry from fully meeting customer demand and that has improved over the course of 2023. We saw the markets peak really in the second quarter and saw some slight drop off in the second half, but to the high end of our guide, it was not as much as we had forecast going into Q1. Backlogs look strong, in particular, feeling quite good about the medium duty market and continuing to watch what happens. We are still predicting a shallow cycle and further softening as we go into the second half of the year. So that, just some color behind those numbers is how I would describe that. Tim Thein : Okay, I had a question on kind of what that implied in terms of the market share, but I can follow up with Chris after and then maybe the second one is just on the implied decrementals for the engine segment in '24 and obviously, the kind of a high 30% number, the JV income will certainly be a drag on that, but maybe with not to go through every single piece, but the parts headwind was pronounced in '23 for Cummins and I'm just curious for that piece, specifically, you outlined that the guidance for the off highway parts outlook, but for that and anything else that maybe you'd call out that's relevant to the year-over-year margin performance for engines? Thank you. Mark Smith : Yeah, good, good question, Tim and the main thing that you didn't cover there was just our assumptions around product coverage. We're not expecting any significant change, but baked into our guidance is a little bit higher product coverage or warranty as a percent of sales in the engine business. We'll see how that plays out, but, that's the other factor that's in there that you didn't list. Operator : Our next question is from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please proceed. David Raso : Hi, thank you. Just sort of a bigger picture question, I know there's been a lot of costs involved and you're right in the thick, of course, call it a decade long energy transition that there's a lot of expenses. I'm just curious, if you look out over the next year or two, is there an inflection point that you see your cost begin to recede and if not, is there a thought of maybe a larger cost out program? I recognize the separation program you discussed, but just something maybe more substantial size, just given relative to other names we look at, they've had a real strong run on profitability the last couple years and it's been a little more of a challenge for your margin. So just curious if you see something on the horizon that really changes that, be it cost inflection, or maybe an idea you've proactively taken, sorry, spend inflection coming down, or something on the cost side that maybe you can do. Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, David, thanks. Thanks for the question. And first, I'll say, I think you said decade long energy transition, I would just put an S on that decades long, right? It's going to take time. The reality is, if you look across our different markets and regions, it's going to take time for that transition to occur. We are in a period, though, of really peak investment in the engine business. As we invest in these fuel agnostic engine platforms, we've got a major investment in R&D and capital to do that. And we think that those engines are going to really position us well with high efficiency diesel products as customers have and continue to decide not to invest in their own platforms and to use Cummins and then also the fuel flexibility that will help customers as they begin to transition, whether its natural gas or hydrogen-based engine solutions. And so the next few years until we launch those platforms in the '26, '27 timeframe, we're seeing higher levels of R&D in those products and then, of course, we're also in a period where we've got somewhat lower revenue and higher investments in the accelerator business and we are pacing that investment based on how we see the market moving. We're looking at opportunities to share investments while having a leading solution, like you saw us do with the battery cell joint venture. As revenues grow, we improve parts of those businesses and electrified components. We've now delivered 1500 buses with Bluebird and ramping up the electrolyzer that will help improve margin performance of the business there. And then the last thing I'd say is, as Cummins has done, and we will continue to do, we're looking at how do we improve different parts of our business and so following the acquisition of the North America distribution business, we had a focused investment on improving margin there and you see that playing out in the distribution business performance and I talked about the focus last year that started in our power systems business. You see that playing out there, the Meritor integration, and we're continuing to look at places that we can improve operating performance of our business and then watch market demands and cost and so the voluntary reduction actions that we took last year help us as we see some reduction in revenue this year. So all those things come together to allow us to continue to improve our returns to investors while making sure we're investing in key products and technologies for the future. David Raso : All right, thank you. And just a minute real quick, and I'll hop off. The cadence of the declines in North America truck that you're looking to experience as the year goes on, can you give us a little sense of the cadence, maybe from an industry perspective, and would your declines, the cadence be any different? Just the idea of the lead lag between what's in inventory, how early you ship, just trying to get a sense for the cadence and how you relate to the industry cadence. Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, great. So, obviously, there's some lead that we have in supplying engines into truck build. So our engine build rates will slightly lead truck build rates, but as I said earlier, from a guide perspective, we think where we were running as we ended the year is going to hold pretty steady through the first part of the year and then we're forecasting some softening toward the end of second quarter and into the second half of the year. Mark Smith : In a medium duty truck, there really isn't that much difference between the two, and market and hours and then heavy duty, that's where we see a little bit more vulnerability for the market and would largely expect us to move in line with the market. Jennifer Rumsey : And then the last dynamic is in pickup, we've got the product changeover that'll drive Q4 volumes lower and pickup. Operator : Our next question is from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Angel Castillo : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to unpack that cadence for the second half a little bit more. I think last quarter you had indicated aftermarket was an area that maybe was giving you a bit of a signal that there was a bit of a softening. And I think you indicated that things came in maybe the higher end of your expectations, and you kind of see that continuing into the first half. So as we kind of position that second half slowdown and now an expectation for aftermarket to actually pick up from the kind of flat to up 5% through the year, can you tell us, I guess, what you're seeing in terms of customer commentary and any kind of signs or what kind of gives you confidence in that second half slowdown as we think about the year? Mark Smith : Yeah, I'll have a go -- first go at that question. First of all, I'll just say on aftermarket, we saw a very pronounced, I would say some element of de-stocking or lower production across our lower demand in parts in Q4, which we largely attribute to customer cash flow management. We don't expect that to be a continuing trend. We expect to recover from Q4 levels on parts and be pretty steady across the year. On the truck builds, well, of course, you've heard from most of our major customers. So we really don't have much more to say other than the backlog of trucks has been slowly edging down and then the thing that gives us the broader concern is the spot rates and the health of the truck fleet operators. That's our principal concern. It's not our OEM customers and right now that the backlog and the orders still continue at quite decent levels. It's what's happening to the underlying economics of freight activity. That's what's giving us the concern combined, which hasn't been moving in the right direction, combined with the slowly easing heavy duty backlog. So it isn't a kind of pronounced downturn we might have seen in prior cycles at this point, but those are the factors that are weighing into our consideration and I think our guidance isn't more conservative than anybody else's and we don't have any other observations beyond those really. Angel Castillo : Got it. That's helpful and then maybe pivoting to Accelera, I just wanted to maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of curious what you're seeing in the backlog trends from 3Q to 4Q and as you kind of deliver on at least the electrolyzers over the next 12 months to 18 months, can you talk to us, I guess, about the cadence of the profitability of that business? We kind of exit 2024 and you start to have higher deliveries on those and maybe what you kind of foresee the exit rate will be in terms of that profitability? Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, so we are in a period of still pretty heavy investment in Accelera businesses are really making both R&D and manufacturing investments to scale up the product and we're fortunate we have, existing plant and data that we can invest within to do that, to begin to produce electrolyzers and we continue to see growing demand and backlog is, as I noted, at a record level for electrolyzers. So that production rate is going to begin to grow and then you'll see margin performance in the electrolyzer portion of the business improving as the revenues grow and we deliver that backlog out into the market. Same thing in our electrified components business as we see revenue growth there. You'll see margin performance improving. One thing we have now included in our 2024 investment, of course, is beginning to invest in the battery cell joint venture and we believe that, that is a key investment that we're making together to ensure we have a leading cell for commercial vehicles here in the U.S. and domestic supply, which will both allow us and our customers to take advantage of incentives that are available and ensure security of supply over time into this market. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed. Rob Wertheimer : Yeah, hi. I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on what's happening in the data center and large engine market. Obviously, it's very strong. I don't know how many years of visibility you have or what that market looks like. Your primary competitor announced a capacity expansion. I don't know where your capacity and your room to grow into that market if it is, a multiyear kind of curve. So I wonder if you could kind of give us an update on dynamics there. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, the data center market is an exciting growth market, has been for several years a trend with increasing cloud, data storage in the cloud and now with artificial intelligence and other investments. We continue to see very strong demand. We guided up 10% to 15%. Backlog for that market is very, very strong. We're looking at our capacity to make sure that we can meet the market demand and feeling good about the product offering that we have and of course, that business and the focus on improving underlying performance of that business will help us as that market grows. Mark Smith : Probably the clearest secular trend over the next couple of years. Jennifer Rumsey : I don't. Yeah, I think it will continue. Rob Wertheimer : And then do you have room to grow in '25 and '26? Maybe not sure too much on your capacity, but it seems as though you're probably, you're probably being asked to quote or to think about, capacitor that far out, right. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, I will just say we expect that that trend of data center market growth will continue and we are and we'll continue to look at our capacity and how we position to meet that demand. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. Perfect. I'll stop there. If I can sneak one more in on medium duty, there's a bit of a narrative that as the COVID constrained production, the OEMs prioritized large class state over the medium duty and that's reflected somewhat in industry outlooks in your out. I'm just wondering if medium duty has more inherent demand than that being helped by interest rates or anything else, or if that's kind of where the market is kind of flattish? I'll stop there. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah. There were certainly the OEMs experienced a number of supply chain constraints and continued in '23 and even into the early part of this year, frame rails in particular. So we are, as you as you saw, really expect the medium duty market to continue to hold pretty flat to where it is now. It's quite strong. We, of course, have a strong position in that market and we're seeing continued demand and pent-up demand from some of the customers in that market for our product. So less often in there than heavy duty. Operator : Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I think you highlighted DV [ph] adoption scenarios at your last Analyst Day. As of today, I know you're hosting another Analyst Day this year, but as of today, which scenario, the fast versus slow, seems more likely? And how do you think that affects your Accelera target of $6 billion to $13 billion revenue by 2030? Any updates on that? Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, as you said, we did a kind of a low and a high scenario for adoption at our last Analyst Day and you can expect that we're going to refresh our view of that as we go into the Analyst Day in May. What I would say is that, there are regulations and incentives that are helping to start to drive that adoption, maybe more towards the lower end of those scenarios is what we would think and we are continuing to look at pacing of investment to make sure that we're managing that in line with how we see adoption actually occurring. Tami Zakaria : Got it. So if it's more leaning toward, let's say, the slower version, does that have a dampening or somewhat negative or slowing impact on the Accelera targets that you have out there? Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, we're still within, it would still fall within the range that we gave in the Analyst Day, consistent with those range of scenarios that we suggested and recall that, a large portion of that revenue in 2030 for Accelera is in the growth of the electrolyzer business as well. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much. First off, a housekeeping question. I'm trying to understand cash flow dynamics as we exit the year and the leverage profile. Obviously the settlement impacts that a bit, but, you typically have a target to return 30% of cash flow to shareholders. How are we thinking about return to capital this year and where you're kind of aiming to end the year on leverage? Mark Smith : Yeah, so morning, Noah. So we're going to start the year with the same stance as last year, invest in the business, dividend focus and some more de-levering. That's the way we start in the year. We'll continue to evaluate that with our board as we see how the cycle unfolds. At least that's our initial stance. Of course, part of our, in years where we've generated more cash than we've needed, then we've returned significantly more than the 50% in any given year, but anyway, we think this is the approach right now until we see a little bit more on the cycle. Noah Kaye : All right. So you do expect to de-lever as we get to the end of the year. Mark Smith : Yes. Noah Kaye : Okay. And then just the guide for China truck seems a bit wide. Can you kind of talk us through the low end and the high end of the range in terms of the scenarios you're envisioning? Is it high end contingent on stimulus? Walk us through what you're seeing and assuming. Chris Clulow : Yeah. That really reflects low visibility, right? So we've come off a very weak base, but there just isn't clear signals yet from the market as to what's actually going to happen. So we can build a case. It's hard for me to think of a case that's a lot lower than where we are today, but just the overall pace of the economy continues to be sluggish and so that upside really leaves room for something unexpected on the stimulus side, which has happened from time to time in China, but we don't have brilliant insight at this point in time. The outlook is cloudy and the conviction from OEMs is not quite there yet. We're doing well with our customers, launching more products. We're bullish on continuing to outgrow in the market in China, both consolidated revenues and in the performance of the JVs. We're all set to outperform. We just need a little bit of help from the market overall, but it's not as tangible as we'd like at the start of the year. Of course, we'll look at the same data points and provide you with an update. Hopefully, by the end of Q1, we tend to have a stronger view of the. And my voice is done for the rest of the morning. Jennifer Rumsey : Chris and I will answer the rest of the questions. Chris Clulow : We'll see how much it clears on China. Operator : Our final question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please proceed. Michael Feniger : Yeah. Thank you guys for squeezing me in. Just the share count's been kind of flat to slightly up. There's a comment in the release about a focus on debt reduction, payment of dividends. Can you just flesh out the priorities in 2024, because I know Mark mentioned with Atmus, I heard buybacks. Just maybe you can reiterate the framework of how we should kind of think about Atmus in 2024 as we move through the years, some of the puts and takes there. Mark Smith : The main impacts of Atmus operation will be obviously, they'll set off on their own pursuing their growth strategy and as this final step, we will swap Cummins shares for -- investors will retire Cummins shares in exchange for Atmus shares. So our share count will go down if the exchange is successful. The reason our share count here in the past 18 months hasn't been changing or drifting up is because we stopped the share repurchase as well. We de-levered post the Meritor acquisition, which we've been telegraphing to investors. We've got a little bit more of deleveraging to go, and then we'll continue to evaluate whether we, what our opportunities are to generate the best returns for investors, either through organic growth or through more capital returns, but that's the basic way it's going to work. The share count will go down on the separation. Michael Feniger : Fair enough. And Mark, I want to let you go and get better. Just quick question for you is just on Meritor, I think '23, I think there's revenue about $4.8 billion, maybe EBITDA a little bit above $500 million. Just when we think of the guide for '24 on components, anything you can help us unpack about how that Meritor in '23, how that kind of trends in '24 relative to your overall components guide? Thanks everyone. Mark Smith : Got it. And I will say I'm feeling better than I sound, and that's largely because of the record cash flow. So please, as I said at the start, don't read into my breaking voice. Meritor achieved the goals we had for this year. It is not a segment on its own. We provided that data for the first full year for transparency purposes to make sure investors had a read on how we were doing after a little bit of a bumpy start when we first acquired Meritor. So that's all rolled into the guidance, but it's safe to say we've got further improvement in Meritor going into 2024 and we're really pleased with how the team is doing there, Ken Hogan and his team. So we're excited about that going forward. So thank you. Thanks everybody. Appreciate it. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris for closing comments. Chris Clulow : Thank you, everybody. That concludes our teleconference for the day. I appreciate all of you participating and your continued interest. As always, our Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Chris. You may begin. Christopher Clulow : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter.  In March, Cummins successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions, while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. We are proud of our employees' hard work and all who were involved to ensure successful separation, and we are excited to see what the future holds for both Cummins and Atmus. The final step in the separation of Atmus resulted in a tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced Cummins shares outstanding by 5.6 million. In addition, we reintroduced our fuel-agnostic platforms with the name that captures the innovation that powers us forward, Cummins HELM platform. With higher efficiency, lower emissions and multiple fuels, the Cummins HELM platforms give our customers control of how they navigate their own journeys as part of the energy transition. As the next product in the Cummins HELM 15-liter platform, we announced we will launch the next-generation diesel X15 in North America for the heavy duty on-highway market, which will be compliant with the U.S. EPA and CARB 2027 aligned regulations at launch. Lastly, in April, Cummins Power Generation introduced 4 new generator sets to the award-winning Centum Series, powered by Cummins QSK50 and QSK78 engines. These new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers, health care facilities and wastewater treatment plant. I was excited to attend the launch event with our customers and hear about the growing demand for these critical applications and high interest in our genset products, which build on decades of experience meeting our customers' needs and deliver a step change improvement in power density, assured reliability, sustainability and low emissions. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% compared to $1.4 billion or 16.1% a year ago. First quarter 2024 results include a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses as we continue to work to simplify our operating structure and improve the efficiency of our business for the long term. This compares to the first quarter 2023 results, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses, EBITDA percentage decreased by 80 basis points as improved pricing partially offset lower volumes and higher research and development expenses as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future. Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the benefits of pricing more than offset the impact of lower volumes and supply chain cost increases.  Our first quarter revenues in North America were flat with 2023. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 73,000 units, down 5% from 2023 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, down 7% from 2023. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 8%, while our unit sales were 36,000, up 22% from 2023. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the Ram pickups in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from the 2023 levels. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 21%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. Our international revenues decreased by 1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with the accelerating data center demand. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 305,000 units, an increase of 14% from last year. However, shifts in the market share during the first quarter led to a decline in our volumes year-over-year. The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2023 levels at 486,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 37,000, an increase of 3%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 50,000 units, a decrease of 13% from 2023 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weak property investment, high equipment population and slowing export demand. Our units sold were 9,000 units, an increase of 10% as a result of the QSM15 penetration and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 7% in the first quarter as accelerating data center demand was offset by softening in other markets. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $758 million, an increase of 1% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 7%, while our shipments decreased by 5% as the market slowed ahead of elections in April. Power generation revenues increased by 37% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. Now let me provide an outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Our full year guidance now excludes Atmus from the March 18 separation date onwards and also include -- excludes the first quarter gain related to the divestiture. The guidance provided previously included Atmus for the full year as it preceded the transaction announcement. We are happy to share that our expectations for 2024 have improved from our initial guidance issued in February. Our forecast for total company revenue in 2024 remains the same at down 2% to 5%, which implies higher base business revenues of approximately $1.3 billion compared to our prior guidance as Atmus is now excluded from future quarters. We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 compared to our prior guide of 245,000 to 265,000 units, though We do still expect softening in the second half of the year. In North America, medium-duty truck market, we maintain our prior guidance of 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat from 2023, consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, down 5% to 10% from 2023 as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance. We project a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in the light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be in the range -- to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and potentially slower export demand. The short-term shifts in the market share that I noted earlier are expected to normalize as we progress through the remainder of the year. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand, consistent with our prior guidance. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, up from our previous guidance of down 5% to 15%. We continue to expect weak property investment and slowing export demand in China. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. We are raising our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 10% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of about 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. While a smaller market for us, we continue to anticipate demand for oil and gas engines to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. For aftermarket, we've maintained our guidance of down 5% to up 5% for 2024, as we are through the inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to $354 million in 2023, consistent with our prior guidance. We are ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and capability to deliver orders to our customers as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, coming off a strong first quarter, we are maintaining our sales growth outlook for the year of down 2% to 5% as stronger demand in our base business has offset the removal of Atmus for future quarters from our guidance. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% compared to our previous guidance of 14.4% to 15.4%, reflecting stronger North America heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, which more than offsets the loss of profitability of Atmus. In addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. During the quarter, we returned $239 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we reduced the overall Cummins share count by 5.6 million as we completed the Atmus share exchange, which will be more fully reflected in the average share count in the second quarter and beyond. I am impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world for delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in the future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect our planet for future generations and returning cash to our shareholders. I look forward to discussing our long-term strategy further in our upcoming Analyst Day on May 16 and now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter revenue and profitability and generated positive operating cash flow. Given the strength of first quarter results and our improved outlook, we've raised our full year expectations for 2024 after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. First quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, down 1% from a year ago. The separation of Atmus in mid-March resulted in a year-over-year sales decline of around 1% to our -- to Cummins consolidated sales.  Our underlying revenues increased in North America and Latin America and were offset by weaker demand in China and Europe. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales for the quarter. We completed the tax-free full separation of Atmus in March, which resulted in a onetime gain on the divestiture of $1.3 billion, net of transaction costs and other expenses. First quarter results also included $29 million of restructuring expenses. This compares to first quarter of 2023, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. To provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to prior year, I am excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses in my following comments. Financial results of Atmus through March 18 are included in our first quarter consolidated sales and EBITDA. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.4 billion or 16.3% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percentage was driven by investment in new products and capabilities and lower sales volumes. Now let's look into more detailed by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.5% of sales compared to $2 billion or 24% even last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, especially in the Power Systems business. Selling, administrative and research expenses increased by $72 million, driven by higher research costs as we continue to bring to market new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly the development of the HELM product line within the Engine business. Joint venture income of $123 million increased $4 million from the prior year, primarily due to increased earnings in the Power Systems segment. Other income was $21 million, a decrease of $50 million from a year ago. The decrease in other income is driven by the relative negative impact of foreign currency revaluation and lower gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance compared to a year ago. Interest expense was $89 million, an increase of $2 million from the prior year, driven by higher outstanding, long-term borrowings related to the bond issuance we completed in February. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, mainly due to the tax-free gain on the separation of Atmus. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share, which includes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus of $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share and restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per share. Just to reinforce what Jen said, full impact of the lower share count from the Atmus separation will be seen in future quarters since the diluted share counts counted on a weighted average basis. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $276 million compared to an inflow of $495 million in the first quarter last year. Now let me comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, prior guidance for 2024 assume that the operations of Atmus would be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Components segment revenue was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 6%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus, increased from 14.6% of sales to 14.8% driven primarily by improved performance within Cummins [indiscernible]. For Components, we've updated the guidance for the segment following the separation of Atmus and expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14% and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. Our latest guidance reflects an increase in both revenues and EBITDA margins after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 2% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a decrease from 15.3% a year ago as the benefit of pricing offset by lower volumes and higher research costs. 2024, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 5% to flat, an improvement of 2% at the midpoint from our prior year projections, reflecting a revised outlook in the North American truck markets and stronger-than-expected demand from our construction customers. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.7%, an increase of 20 basis points at the midpoint due to higher volumes. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 5% from a year ago to $2.5 billion. EBITDA decreased as a percent of sales to 11.6% compared to 13.9% of sales a year ago as aftermarket sales, particularly to industrial customers declined from the record levels that we experienced a year ago. We expect 2024 distribution revenues to be flat to up 5% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, an increase from the prior guide of 3% for revenues and a modest improvement to margins for the full year. Power Systems segment revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 3% and EBITDA increased from 16.3% to 17.1% of sales driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and operating improvements, all of which contributed to a strong trend of improving performance in that segment. 2024, we now expect Power Systems revenues to be flat to 5%, up 3% at the midpoint and EBITDA has also increased to be approximately 16% to 17%, up 80 basis points from our previous guide. Accelera revenues increased 9% to $93 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $101 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $94 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support future growth. In 2024, our guidance is unchanged. We expect revenues to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $433 million consistent with our prior guide. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions, end markets, we are adjusting the full year company guidance, and we project company revenue -- consolidated company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, consistent with the prior year guidance despite the separation of Atmus. Company EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 14.5% to 15.5%, up 10 basis points from prior guidance, all of which excludes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 24%, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from our outlook 3 months ago as we continue to make critical investments in new products, capacity expansion to support future growth. In summary, we delivered solid sales, profitability and positive cash flow in the first quarter. We do still expect moderation in some of our key markets in the second half of 2024, but we have raised our expectations of our own performance relative to our prior guide. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward leaving us well positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality and continue investing and delivering strong financial performance. Our priorities in 2024 for capital allocation are unchanged. We will reinvest for growth, plan to raise the dividend and reduce debt. Thank you for your interest today, and I look forward to seeing some of you in person in New York at our upcoming Analyst Day. Now let me turn it over to Chris. Christopher Clulow : Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Volkum (sic) [ Steve Volkmann ] with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : I think I'd like to start off with power gen, if we could. That business seems to be going well. So sort of 2 things I'm curious to hear about exactly kind of what you think your position is in the data center market. How much of your business is data centers? And then how are you thinking about increasing capacity over the next, whatever, few quarters or years, however, that's going to play out? What should we be thinking about in terms of capacity additions and your ability to kind of grow that business over time? Jennifer Rumsey : Great. Thanks, Steve. And as you heard in the guidance, we're projecting the power gen business to be up 10% to 15% for the year, and data center, mission-critical is really the driver of that. And we've had a very strong demand from data center customers, have had historically a strong position in that market, and that market is obviously growing. We're sold out on our 95-liter through 2025 right now. And I mentioned the launch of the new Centum product, which uses our 50 and 78-liter engine. So that's providing additional solution to those customers. And then, of course, we're continuing to look at capacity of the 95-liter and how we plan to support what we think will be continuing strong and growing market. Stephen Volkmann : So sorry, do you have any concrete plans to increase capacity of 95 yet? Or is that still in process? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, we do have concrete plans to increase the capacity that we have in place to-date for the 95-liter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : I wonder if I just ask the cadence of earnings over the course of this year, nice to see an upwards revision to both top line and margins. Mark, can you just talk about where the quarter came in versus your expectations because obviously, the quarter was light versus where the consensus was set up, and I'm just wondering how the quarter developed versus your internal plan. And what's the cadence of the acceleration that you folks are seeing to raise the guidance higher? Mark Smith : Yes. I think to be fair to everyone involved to all of you on that side of the fence and all of us here, there's a lot of moving parts with the separation of Atmus. So from my perspective, in total, we came in, in line with our expectations and when you adjust for the mid-quarter separation of Atmus, I think we're by and large in line. I would say, as someone pointed out, the Distribution business margins a little bit lower, certainly lower than last year. We see those at the bottom end of the range in Q1 and improving from here, largely driven by what we've seen as a pullback on parts sales, particularly in the industrial off-highway applications. So that's the 1 area. It's not new. It's been there for a couple of months, 2 quarters. But otherwise, I'd say we feel good about the gross margin improvement year-over-year. As you can see from our announcements and our comments, we're continuing to look at ways to streamline our organization, make us more efficient where we can. So overall, in line, Jerry, but expecting Distribution in particular to pick up in its margins going forward. We've always expected -- probably we were expecting this a little bit last year, to be fair, and it didn't materialize. But we are expecting heavy-duty truck production to decline in the third quarter, in particular, and you've probably heard that from other industry participants. I think the Engine business and Components will feel some of that in Q3, probably Q4 Power Systems and Distribution shouldn't see any significant volatility in revenues. And really, the momentum is to the up on Power Systems going forward and into next year, clearly. And Distribution. As you know, it's more than half parts and service and quite predictable and reliable. We just had a little bit of a mix shift with the lower parts, but we think that's temporary. Jerry Revich : Super. And can I just ask from a bigger picture standpoint, so new regulations 2027 will have embedded warranties essentially. What does that mean for your parts market share. Is that an opportunity when that field population increases for you folks to have higher engine parts market share because of that warranty dynamic on the new regulations, how significant is that opportunity? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean, as you noted, there's a requirement starting with the EPA 2027 regulations for longer emissions warranty for heavy-duty 10 years or 450,000 miles, most of that application is going to mile out. So it's essentially what our 5-year extended warranty that some customers are already purchasing. And then that will mean that everybody will need that warranty that will be embedded into pricing on those engine systems and then, of course, we'll drive customers to genuine part throughout that period, which will provide some further benefit to us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : I'm going to ask mine together because they're related. So and they're both around Power Systems. So I think in the guidance, you guys are embedding full year margins below 1Q levels. I think it's a lumpy business, but if I look back historically, it's more common that the second half is higher. And then similar question on growth, the comps [ reduced ] slightly in the second half, but your full year growth guidance is, for an outcome less than the growth you saw in the first quarter. So if you could address both of those items. Mark Smith : We do tend to see some seasonality on revenue in the fourth quarter, a little bit in the second half. But I think the point of your question is essentially right, Nicole, there's positive momentum there. We've been raising the guidance as the performance is improving. There is some modest variation depending on how the parts flow in that business. But overall, our messages, we're confident in the business and the improvements that we have Jenny Bush and her team have really worked hard on over the last 18 months. And if we get more revenue, we're confident we'll be able to turn that in higher earnings. But there's nothing dramatically structurally different. Going forward, we expect improvement over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : May 16, the meeting, can you just give us some expectations around the meeting? I think particularly around the margins. I think people are just trying to figure out the operating leverage in the company in the last couple of years, maybe not quite the margins people were expecting. Even the guide today, it was nice to see the power gen margin increase. But overall, the relative increase in earnings relative to the increase implicit in the sales guide. Still not that tremendous. So I'm just curious if you can sort of tee up a little bit what should we expect May 16. not trying to steal the thunder of the meeting but just to level set... Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Well, obviously, I won't tell you what we're going to tell you specifically, but certainly, you can expect us to talk about overall strategy for the company where we think we're at against some of the 2030 goals that we shared in our last Analyst Day and certainly talking about revenue and margin expectations and what the drivers for that will be within that. So I think you'll hear more about that for sure, David, at our Analyst Day. David Raso : Okay. And 1 quick one. The JV income in the first quarter was up year-over-year, but you're still guiding the year down. And I'm just trying to make sure we know why is it down? Is it China not continuing some of the improvement? Is there other parts of the royalty income? I know it's a pretty lumpy line item within the JV income. If you can help us with that would be great. Mark Smith : Yes. I think you're exactly right, David. There's really 2 moving parts of the operating performance, which generally tends to move in line or better than the market rate. And then we get very lumpy tech fees from the joint venture back to Cummins consolidated results as new products are launched and last year was a particularly strong period of new product launch, [indiscernible] certain development milestones. So the tech fees are going to be down, particularly in the Engine business primarily and that's offsetting any assumptions around the market growth. I will say it's -- there was some truck OEM build increases in the Q1, but that was more on expectations or hopes about going forward, we're still waiting for clearer signs of momentum as China, as you know, is the biggest driver of the earnings there. But it's really lower tech fees, which were a big at last year -- a little bit in components, mostly in the Engine business. Christopher Clulow : One quick add there, David. And we also have built in our plan the launch of the battery joint venture later on this year post approval. So that will have some losses as well as that comes back online in the second half. Mark Smith : Which is embedded in Accelera. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, we're expecting that. We have final regulatory approval for that battery JV. So we're expecting that's going to start flowing in Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Angel Castillo Malpica : Just back to the Power Generation segment. I think you raised your guidance to 10% to 15% versus a 5% to 10% previously. Can you just talk about the price versus volume mix makeup of that versus prior expectations? Is this a matter of getting better production than you kind of anticipated? Or is pricing growing and just kind of what are you seeing from that perspective? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So there's a couple of dynamics to keep in mind in that market. So first of all, as I articulated, the order board is pretty long. And so some of the work to improve price cost in response to inflation and performance of the business takes some time to play out. So we're starting to see stronger pricing leverage come into that market. And then we're continuing to, of course, drive improvements in the Power Systems business and efficiency in manufacturing and supply chain. And I noted the launch of the new products that we've also designed to be able to sell at some higher margins. So there are some favorable dynamics that have been happening in the power gen market compared to historically where we would have been in margin performance. Angel Castillo Malpica : That's very helpful. And along the lines of new products, just you talked about your X15 diesel engine that's coming out for kind of ahead of the emissions regulations. Can you give us a little bit more as to what you kind of expect in terms of guardrails around pricing and margin potential improvement. I know you typically run emission cycles when you get kind of the opportunity to reset and recover some of that margin. So as we think about maybe not necessarily specifically to any given year, but those projects -- or those products and kind of the implications to your price and margins as those get rolled out? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So certainly, like in past emissions regulations, our goal is to deliver incremental value to the customer, to have margin improvement associated with that. You will see with the 27 EPA regulations, we already talked about the emissions warranty dynamic. You will also see added content, in particular, after-treatment system to meet those regulations has notable additional content. And then you will also have the warranty dynamic that we always have as we launch new products where we began at least to launch to accrue at a higher rate from a warranty perspective until the product is out in the market, and we've demonstrated warranty. So those are the moving parts that you'll see. We have not yet shared specific numbers on what we expect around exact pricing for those products. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Tami Zakaria : So I wanted to understand the margin guide a little better. It seems like excluding Atmus, which probably -- which was a headwind separating that out is becoming a headwind, but you sort of raised the full year guide by about 10 basis points, expecting better margins in Engines and Power Systems. So just to get a sense of what's really driving this improved margin expectation? Is it higher volumes? Or is it more cost savings? Or is it more price/cost? So any color there would be helpful. Mark Smith : Good question. You're right that the Atmus separation is a little bit dilutive to margins. So yes, good that you picked up on that. It's really volume and a little bit of cost reduction activity. Those are the 2 primary drivers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius research. Robert Wertheimer : My question is going to be around your competitive positioning in the 2027 EPA from what you can see today. There's a bunch of questions we get on whether there's a prebuy on what the cost increase would be and maybe the warranty should be stripped out of that, I'm not sure. And there may also be more subtle things that you guys would understand better than most of us around how the standards can be met, whether having an additional nat gas where you guys do pretty well can offset other emissions and so forth. So that's the general question. Price increase, whether share gain and whether there's any subtleties around your mix in your early preparedness that will help you in 2027 transition? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And we are investing, as we've talked about in the new HELM engine platforms. And we're in a unique position because of our scale to continue to invest in what will be a market-leading engine solutions to meet those future regulations. And so we expect that, that will provide some advantage for us as we go into those regulations. There will be a dynamic we think that's going to play out in the '25 and '26 time period as end customers anticipate a major regulation change and what that will mean to them. And so we expect that's going to drive some things beyond the normal cycle in the U.S. truck market. And then as we go into 2017, there'll be some period of uptake, but we think we're well positioned. Obviously, our position in medium duty has continued to strengthen, and we'll have a next-generation 15-liter natural gas that will go into the market later this year that is of high interest to some of our customers that have sustainability ambitions and see this as the best way, most cost-effective and reliable way to meet those ambitions and then we'll have a new high-efficiency 15-liter platform and 10-liter platform as well. So we're excited about our position with those products and really focused on the execution of development and launching them into the market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Just sticking with the EPA 2027 for a minute here. If the final rules continue to provide nice crediting of hydrogen trucks. And just given your offerings in this space, wondering if you started to see more of a pickup for hydrogen fuel cell or whether most of sort of the Accelera inbounds at this point are primarily both. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So if you look beyond even the '27 into the EPA announced the Phase 3 greenhouse gas regulation, which is going to really start to shape the industry as we get into 2030 and beyond, no major surprises for us with that regulation, but it is really an unprecedented level of ambition and assumptions around 0 emissions vehicle penetration. And so the industry and the government is going to have to work really closely together for that to be successful.  So to your question, one of the things -- there are a few things that we're pleased about in the regulation. One is it actually recognizes hydrogen engines as a zero-emission solution. So we believe that, that will create a space for hydrogen fueled engine that hydrogen fuel cells still are a good solution over time, but the adoption rate on that is likely to be -- take some time, I would say. And then the EPA also did commit to work to streamline hybrid powertrain certification. So hybrid engines, we think, may be an attractive solution because the infrastructure availability is going to be a challenge. So that's another thing that we're looking at closely. So there's still some engine-based solutions. Yes, we're seeing an uptick today in more of the battery electric powertrain as I noted, and of course, electrolyzers, fuel cells are still at pretty low level. Noah Kaye : Yes, makes sense. And then you mentioned that you got regulatory approval for the JV. So just can you lay out for us kind of the game plan on how spending for the gigafactory should proceed over the next couple of years? And what you may be doing at this point in terms of lining up supply and demand for the factory, at least your [indiscernible] Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean the partners have been working together ahead of getting the final regulatory approval we announced that we selected a site earlier this year. So we'll be -- we're getting a site ready in Mississippi, just outside of Memphis to kind of see and really starting the work to prepare for supply chain and building the plant. We -- now that we have regulatory approval, we believe we'll be able to close and finalize the entity in this quarter. And then we'll have phased investment as we build the plant and work towards start of production in 2027. And then we're, of course, sharing this investment of a 21-gigawatt hour plant across the partners and have this design that will allow us to phase in new lines and scale up the plant and production rates based on how we see the industry developing, and we're still feeling really good about how we're positioned in the market together with LFP cell that will be designed specifically for the commercial vehicle market and have the ability to leverage some of the incentive money that's available here to help enable adoption in our commercial vehicle market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Jamie Cook : So sorry, I'm managing through like 7 calls. I hope this hasn't been asked. But Mark, the question is to you, I guess, understanding you have your guys' Analyst Day coming up this month. I'm just looking at Cummins and thinking, okay, perhaps there's a cost story there, you have market share gains that should be helping you maybe less spend on Accelera. I'm just wondering, as you think about margins over the medium term, do you think there's an opportunity to structurally improve incremental margins? Or as you think about sort of the next couple of years, it is more so taking these actions to hit Cummins' historic targeted incremental margins? And then my second question would be, and if this is addressed, I apologize. Can you just talk to the visibility you have across like in terms of backlog across your portfolio, in particular, for the engine side and the Power Systems side. Mark Smith : So I heard you we will explicitly address incremental margins in May. You will not miss that for all who are asking, very appropriate, at center of mind -- or top of mind for us clearly. So you will hear that very, very shortly, I guess. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. And Jamie, good to have you back. We're, of course, working and you're seeing the improvement in the Meritor business as we do the integration and Accelera as we ramp up. Revenue, we'll talk more about that. In terms of color on the market, we're seeing continued solid demand in the heavy-duty market because of the high backlogs that have been built up, still a lot of strength in the vocational market. Truckload's been down for some time. And so we are still anticipating and hearing from our OEM customers that second half will have some weakening, and that's baked into our revised guidance, which is down, but not as far down as previous guidance. Power gen, I noted earlier, we've sold out the 95-liter through '25. We're looking at capacity there and how we can take that up as well as with the new Centum launch, being able to sell some of our other engines into that market as well. So pretty -- really strong feeling very good about power gen, feeling good about medium-duty and vocational on-highway. It's really the -- it's the truckload, fleet customers in the heavy-duty market. That's the one that we're watching closely and still anticipating that it's going to soften before we enter the next uptick in their cycle. Mark Smith : Yes. And then what you heard maybe earlier was some industry consensus building about '25 and '26 ahead of 2027. So our baseline assumption today is that this is not as sharp or as steep as normal cyclical downturn. That's an assumption, not a fact, but that's what we've baked into our outlook for this year. China is the 1 where we're still -- we're waiting for more momentum probably. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Kauffman : I was just curious your thoughts. It's apparent that the downturn, I think a lot of us feared in '24 on the heavy-duty engine side isn't going to be as bad as originally feared. I know ACT Research has taken up their forecast. You did mention some weakness beginning in 3Q, but are we taking from what would have been otherwise prebuy in '26 if we have a better '24? Or do you think the 2 are unrelated? Jennifer Rumsey : I'm not sure that they're related. I mean, we're really watching what's going on with production rates with backlog with some of the spot rate dynamics in the market. And if you look at some of the freight carriers out there, they've been challenged now for the last 18 months. And so that's what's driving our outlook, but fair. I mean we -- because of the -- it's really the supply chain dynamic that has made this cycle so different and even unpredictable. It certainly held up better and longer than we had forecast, and we are still expecting to see some softening in the second half. Jeffrey Kauffman : Well, congratulations. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein Research. Unknown Analyst : This is Federico filling in for Chad. I would like to double click on the R&D intensity and how to think about this on the medium-term basis. Christopher Clulow : Sorry, can you repeat that? I don't think we got the first part. Unknown Analyst : Sorry. We would like to double-click on the R&D intensity and how to think about this on a medium term basis. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So we are -- as you know, we've taken up our R&D investments. We noted that in our comments because we're making investments, in particular in these new fuel-agnostic engine platform. So we're at an elevated level of R&D for those new platform investments. And those products are beginning to launch and really will launch through the '26 and '27 time period. And then, of course, we're at a period of investment in the Accelera business as we work to launch new products and ramp up revenue there as well. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chris Clulow for closing comments. Christopher Clulow : Thanks, everybody, for your participation today. That concludes our teleconference. Really appreciate the interest. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day. Jennifer Rumsey : Look forward to seeing many of you in person in a couple of weeks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris and good morning. I'm excited to be with all of you today as I celebrate my two-year anniversary of becoming CEO of Cummins. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the second quarter. At our recent Analyst Day, I shared that we are raising our long-term financial targets as a result of our of our strengthening portfolio and continued execution our Destination Zero strategy. The strong partnerships that we have with customers and stakeholders are key to driving our strategy and growth profile forward. In this quarter, we strengthened those partnerships even further. In May, we announced with Isuzu Motors Limited the launch of a new 6.7-liter engine designed for use in Isuzu medium-duty truck lineup. This engine will power on-highway truck applications for the Japan market and will be available for Asia-Pacific markets and other global markets later this year. We also announced plans to launch a battery electric powertrain for Isuzu's F-Series in North America. Availability of the medium-duty truck is expected in 2026 and will include Accelera's next-generation lithium-ion phosphate or LFP battery technology. These advancements mark an important milestone for both Cummins and Isuzu as Cummins enters the Japan on-highway market for the first time in our history. We are proud of the partnership our two companies have built, and I'm excited to leverage our collective strength and scale to deliver profitable growth for both partners. Also this quarter, we further progressed our partnership with Daimler Trucks and buses and PACCAR as we completed the formation of joint venture now known as Amplify Cell Technologies, to localize battery cell production in the in the battery supply chain the United States. This included naming the Chief Executive Officer of joint venture and breaking ground at a new manufacturing plant in Marshall County, Mississippi. Amplify Cell Technologies will enable Accelera by Cummins and our partners to advance battery cells focused on commercial and industrial applications in North America and serve our customers' evolving needs. This is a significant step forward as we continue leading our industry into the next era of smarter, cleaner power. And in July, Accelera was awarded $75 million from the Department of Energy to convert approximately 360,000 square feet of existing manufacturing space at our Columbus, Indiana engine plant for zero emissions components, including battery packs and electric powertrain systems. The $75 million grant is the largest federal grant ever awarded solely to Cummins and as part of the appropriations related to the inflation Reduction Act. The Columbus engine plant is also where we manufacture blocks and heads for our current and next-generation engine-based solutions, further showcasing our Destination Zero strategy in action. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues the second quarter of 2024. Sales for the quarter were $8.8 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by continued high demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results included $23 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded supply chain cost increases and offset the impact of the Atmus separation. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 4% to $5.5 billion, driven by the strong demand in our core markets more than offsetting the impact of the separation of Atmus. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter were 75,000 units, up 1% from 2023 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 31,000, up 7% from a year ago. The second quarter marked record production volume for our heavy-duty engines at the Jamestown Engine plant. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 13% and also outpacing the market growth. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for using the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2024, up 8% from 2023. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 23% and driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our second quarter international revenues decreased 2% compared to last year. Second quarter in China, including joint venture, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 2% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 270,000 units, a decrease of 3% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with higher orders for natural gas engines and strong exports offsetting weak domestic diesel demand. In light-duty market in China, we were up 4% from 2023 levels at 480,000 units while our units sold, including joint ventures, were $33,000, an increase of 18%. The industry demand for excavators in China in the second quarter was 53,000 units, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 10,000 units, an increase of 19% as a result of QSM15 penetration at both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 36% in the second quarter, primarily driven by accelerating demand in data centers. This helped drive impressive financial performance at our Cummins Chongqing joint venture within our Power Systems business. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint venture, were $649 million, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 11% and while our shipments increased by 5%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 17% year-on-year as the second quarter of 2023 benefited from pre-buy demand ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our expectations for 2024, while still anticipating the second half to be weaker than the first half, primarily in the North America heavy-duty truck market. We are increasing our revenue guidance to down 3% to flat compared to our prior guidance of down 2% to down 5%. We are also increasing our EBITDA guide to be 15% to 15.5%, compared to our prior guide of 14.5% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue in our Engine, Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting slightly lower revenue expectations for the Accelera business. We also expect stronger profitability in our Engine and Power Systems segments, driving most of the improvement in EBITDA. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 as we still expect softening in the second half of the year. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are raising our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength in vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, with a planned model year changeover likely to drive a temporary dip in production in the second half. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 8% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect slightly weaker property investment and slowing export demand in China. We are raising our guidance for the global power generation market to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% to 15%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, we have improved our guidance to flat to up 5% for 2024, raising the bottom end of our previous guidance of a decline of 5%, with demand holding up better than expected in on- and off-highway markets. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million, a reduction of $50 million from the prior guide. As we noted at our Analyst Day, the energy transition is progressing more slowly, impacting both our e-mobility and electrolyzer revenues. In summary, coming off a strong first half of the year, we are raising our guidance on sales to down 3% to flat and raising our EBITDA guidance to 15% to 15.5%. While we anticipate softening in the North America heavy-duty market in the second half of the year, demand in several of our core markets remain strong. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash shareholders. In July, we announced an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.68 to $1.82 per share, the 15th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. During the quarter, we returned $230 million to shareholders in the form of dividends consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Our diluted earnings per share benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding with the impact of the Atmus split more fully reflected in the weighted average share count in the second quarter. In summary, we had a strong performance in the first half of 2024, driven by record demand for Cummins products in our core markets. It is exciting to see our business grow with long-established customers in existing markets and to see newer partnerships yield additional opportunities in previously untapped markets for Cummins. I'm grateful for our employees who continue to execute on our strategy and deliver solutions that help our customers win wherever they operate. Our results reflect our dedication to delivering strong financial performance while also investing in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. As we discussed at Analyst Day, there is a lot to be excited about in our future. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter. Given the strength of those results and our improved outlook, we've raised the midpoint of our full year expectations for 2024. Second quarter revenues were $8.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago, as organic growth more than offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America increased 4%, while international revenues decreased 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. The year ago numbers included $23 million of costs related to the separation of apps. The benefits of higher volumes and pricing as well as the absence of the separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now I'll go into a little more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.19 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $2.15 billion or also 24.9% a year ago. Flat margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, offset by the removal of Atmus and higher compensation expenses. Selling, admin, and research expenses were $1.21 billion or 13.7% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 14.6% last year. Joint venture income of $103 million decreased $30 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees and the weak domestic truck market in China. Other income was negative $3 million, a decrease of $27 million a year ago. Interest expense was $109 million, an increase of $10 million from prior year, primarily driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, including $9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $726 million or $5.26 per diluted share compared to $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share in Q2 last year. The second quarter reflected the lower weighted average share count as a result of the tax-free share exchange that there was the final separation of Atmus was completed in the first quarter. All-in, operating cash flow was an outflow of $851 million compared to an inflow of $483 million in the second quarter last year, and the decrease was driven mainly by the $1.9 billion payment required by the previously disclosed settlement agreements with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.1 billion, more than double the cash generated in the second quarter last year. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation that occurred on March 18th. Components segment revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of 13% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 14.2% of sales to 13.6%, with both sales and EBITDA primarily impacted by the Atmus separation. For Components, we expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14%, consistent with our prior projections and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, narrowing the range from our previous guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were a record $3.2 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a slight decrease from 14.2% a year ago. As the benefit from pricing and record on-highway volumes in North America was offset by higher research costs and lower joint venture income, primarily in China. In 2024, we now project 2024, we now project -- for the full year sorry, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 3% to up 2%, an increase of 2% from the prior midpoint, driven by a revised outlook in the North American medium-duty truck market. Full year Engine EBITDA is projected to be in the range of $13.7 million to $14.2 million, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint from our prior projections due to higher volumes and ongoing operational efficiencies. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 9% from a year ago to a record $2.8 billion. EBITDA as a percent of sales decreased to 11.1% compared to 11.4% a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses and a higher mix of power generation sales, which are positive for the company overall, but have a dilutive impact on the Distribution segment margins. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10%, an increase of 5% from the prior midpoint, mainly due to stronger power generation markets. And we've revised our EBITDA margin expectations to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.8%, down a little from our prior range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Results for the Power Systems segment set a new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% and EBITDA increased from 13.8% and to 18.9%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements and cost reduction. For 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be up 3% to 8%, an increase of 3% from the prior year guide. EBITDA is now projected to be approximately 17.5% to 18% and up from the previous projections of 16% to 17%. Accelera revenues increased 31% to $111 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $117 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected, whilst reducing costs in areas where we accept the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, down $50 million from our prior guide. Net losses are still expected to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the second quarter and the revised outlook in our key region end markets, we have raised our full year company guidance. We now expect revenues to be down 3% to flat, which is better than our previous guidance of down 2% to down 5%. EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 15% to 15.5%, narrowing the range and increasing the midpoint 25 basis points from our prior guide. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from three months ago, as we continue make critical investments in new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. In summary, we delivered record sales and solid profitability in the second quarter of 2024. We still do expect some moderation in some key markets in the second half of the year, especially North American heavy-duty truck, as we pointed out at our recent Analyst Day also. We've taken some cost to reduce -- we took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward, leaving us well-positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality that we may experience. We continue to deliver strong financial results raising our performance cycle over cycle while still investing for future growth. Our priorities for this year for capital allocation remain to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. Overall, a very strong quarter. Thanks for your time today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. Our comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Just on China truck, you didn't change your expectations there. Wondering how you're thinking about some of the new incentives that the government put in place there to support the second half of the year. Is that a potential point of conservatism in your outlook? Or do you think it may not materialize in there? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. Good morning. We've seen pretty consistent performance out of China and the economic conditions over the last 18 to 24 months, and there's been previous indications of actions the government may take, none of which has really translated into any meaningful change in our industry. So, really, we're seeing the strong performance still with natural gas product an export and a relatively weak domestic diesel market and are not anticipating that changing in the near-term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jamie Cook : Hi, congratulations on a nice and clean quarter. I guess two questions. One, Mark, the margins in Power Systems are quite remarkable on a pretty muted sales growth assumption for 2024. So, if you could just help us understand what's going on there, sort of what's structural versus -- and do you see the opportunity for margins to improve from these levels in the out years given you're already assuming a close to 18% margin this year? And then my second question, Jen, just -- I know you don't want to give a guide for 2025, but how you're thinking about the markets? Is there -- as you think about the U.S. with the potential -- with the election and the overruling of Chevron, are you more conservative about a potential pre-buy? Do you think that gets pushed out? I guess the two positives would be China comes back and then the power system. So, I'm wondering, ultimately, is the incremental margin potential better in 2025 with those assumptions on a muted 2025 pre-buy with better mix from Power Systems in China? Thanks. Mark Smith : Okay. Good questions. We'll try and fit in our answers with the time available for us this evening. On Power Systems, there's really three elements to the margins. And to answer the last part of your question, yes, we do expect there's still more to come. So, the team there is doing a fantastic job, started with some cost reduction, reprioritizing where we're where we're investing, investing less, strong pricing environment on the Power Systems side and then yes, there's more to do on the operational efficiency. So really, it's several strings to the bow in terms of what's been driving the results and still more to come. So we're really, really excited. Hopefully, you felt the confidence from Jenny Bush and to the team from the Analyst Day and have continued to deliver here in the second quarter, and we're bullish on that segment. That's -- those are really the main drivers on Power Systems. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. On the market outlook, what I would say is in the power gen market, the continued growth that we see there, in particular the data center, I don't see that letting up anytime soon, and where we have strong demand, high backlog. And as you know, we talked about in May, making some capacity investments to take advantage of the growing market there. In US on-highway, the medium-duty truck has continued to be strong. We see strong backlog and demand and don't see that letting up in the foreseeable future. and heavy duty, we do see build rates coming down, projecting about 10% down in the third quarter and 20% overall for the second half of year. And the question is what will happen next year with the broader economic environment because well stabilized spot rates and these truck prices are at a lower level than they've been historically, and that's impacted some of our customers demand. And so how that comes together with a pre-buy. The Supreme Court overturning of the Chevron deference, we don't anticipate any impacting regulations in the near-term. We believe that 2027 regulations will continue to move forward. And probably the bigger question is what we see with Phase 3 greenhouse gas in the 2030 time frame. And so we still anticipate some amount of pre-buy ahead of that emissions changeover. But the industry has also demonstrated there's capacity constraints that we've seen in the last couple of years. So how large that pre-buy will be, I think is still question, but we're preparing to have strong demand as we go into the 2027 regulation change. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Steve Volkmann : Great. Thank you, guys. Mark, I think you mentioned maybe both of your pricing being positive. It sounds like it was positive in truck. It sounds like its positive in Power Gen. Can you just double-click on that for us a little bit? I mean how much pricing are you seeing? And sort of how should we think about that for the rest of the year? Mark Smith : Yes. Great questions. So on average, across the company, very, very much by segment, but 2.5% for the year, and that really hasn't changed. That's not changed in the results, but it definitely has been an important driver of the Power Systems results. And I don't think it's going to vary a lot that year-over-year increase should mostly hold across all the quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. And Jennifer, Happy Anniversary. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you. Jerry Revich : I wanted to ask on the medium-duty engine platforms globally, right? So you folks are picking up Daimler's business, now you're picking up Isuzu business in Japan. Can you just expand and talk to us about how many more medium-duty engines, you folks expect to ship globally 2026 versus, I don't know, call it, two or three years ago, given the timing of the transition? And if you could just comment on Japan, is it -- help place to import product into given the currency. Can you just talk about how you folks are able to do that economically? Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah, sure. So you've seen this trend and some of the announcement that we made over the last few years playing out now as regulations start to occur. So we're seeing growing medium-duty demand in the US, of course, with Daimler transitioning to us and us as well as some other customers like keno here in the US. So we're growing our position in the medium-duty market here. We've now launched the medium-duty product in India with Daimler. So we'll start to see some volume there. Their strategy is really driven by regulation change. So when you see regulation change in Europe and Brazil will continue to grow volume with Daimler. On the Isuzu business, we are building that new B6.7 and their Tohoku plant in Japan. So we're not importing that engine. We're building it in the market. First time we've been on-highway market, we've been in the off-highway market there, of course, for many years. And so we'll see some slow volume growth there in Japan. And then as I noted, they'll then launch that truck into other Asia Pacific and global markets later this year. So you're just going to see steady growth, I would say, from Cummins year-over-year in the medium-duty space as these new customer partnerships grow and emissions regulations change and ads. Mark Smith : In India and Brazil to the later 2027. Jennifer Rumsey : 2027 through 2029. Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Angel Castillo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong quarter. I was hoping we could just unpack a little bit more the engine segment. You raised the outlook there on margins, and you've been talking about medium duty, but just as we think about your second half that is expected to decelerate on the heavy-duty side, can you talk about the components driving your margin improvement there? And just helping us kind of quantify what's ultimately driving that and how are you thinking about kind of 2025 margin improvement? Mark Smith : Yeah. So we've got a little bit of help. We've improved the parts outlook. So that certainly helps overall -- we've been taking some measured actions across the company since the second half of fourth quarter of last year into the fourth quarter -- into the first quarter of this year, those should help with some lower costs in the second half of the year. And then we've got a stronger outlook in medium-duty truck. So those are really the three key elements. We're not going to get into breaking down the profitability by us. Those are really the three things that have helped improve. Yeah, and I think the conversion on the volume and the second quarter showed us there's still more room for improvement just in general operating efficiencies. No real change in -- in pricing most of the segments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. David Raso : Hi. Thank you my question is on the guide. One area little skeptical on -- one area where it seems like you have some upside. The engine business, the second half of the year, you're guiding the revenues down only 3% year-over-year. And I'm just trying to go through heavy truck builds down double digit or the parts business mutes that. The light duty has the soft fourth quarter on the model change. Off-highway, comp fees, China a little better but big declines in Ag and some in construction. So I'm trying to understand why the revenue going down 3%? Or is it there's enough new penetration of customers that can push against all that, and at the same time, the engine margins only go down 30 bps sequentially on lower revs. And then the upside is PowerGen revenue growth less than 5% year-over-year in the second half, you're up over 6% in the first half. And the margins are down sequentially, I mean I understand the industrial piece within power can be down, but at least there are comp fees. So I'm just trying to understand, I assume PowerGen has a little more focus, a little more capacity, right, being pushed at minimum, good pricing. So again, why the -- or maybe it's just conservative, conservative on PowerGen, and if you can make us more comfortable on that engine? Thank you. Mark Smith : Thanks, David. Good question. So I think on Power Systems, I don't think there's any fundamental changes. So it's really a key like how much do we -- how much product do we deliver to our customers and the conversion. We've given a range of outcomes for the margin. The business is performing well. And quite frankly, we're raising capacity. So I don't think the sales will go a lot above, but yet we're leaning on the profitability strongly, the business is really doing well. So I don't think there's much to be concerned about there, and we've raised the outlook. On the engine business, I think what's helping mitigate the margins, which is, I guess, the most important part is really some of the cost reduction actions that we've taken during the year, slightly better outlook for parts. And then there's just some of the puts and takes on the revenue. But those are the reasons why the margins at those revenue levels, we expect to hold up. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Very nice quarter. I have two quick clarification questions. One is on the distribution segment. I think margins were lower, but sales were great. So is that margin guide prudently conservative? Or is this a function of the mix headwind from PowerGen? Or is there anything I need to be aware of for that? And then the other question is on price costs. I think you just said price still you expect 2.5% at the enterprise level. Since some of the raw material prices are coming down, do you expect some improvement in price cost for the year? Mark Smith : So to the latter, not significantly, we've probably got about 50 basis points of cost headwind across all the different categories, varies by business and segment. And then on distribution, you're right to point out the margins. So there's really -- yes, for distribution, PowerGen is a little bit dilutive relative to the rest of the segment, even though obviously within Power Systems, its very accretive. So that's true. We've called that out. Also in the first and the second quarter, there was some modest individual charges that didn't merit to be called out in the overall results. So I don't merit a lot of commentary, but just say they've trimmed the margins a little bit. And, therefore, we're really just reflecting where we are for the year. We do believe distribution margins have still got significant potential to improve over time, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Tim Thein : Hi. Good morning. I'll maybe combine these before I get the hook. Actually both pertaining to the North America heavy-duty segment. And the first part is just around market shares, Mark. Obviously, those can and do shift around quarter-to-quarter. And I'm just thinking big picture as we get in a softer back half of the year where the sleeper segment likely is disproportionately impacted from a production standpoint at the expense of vocational. I would imagine that favors Cummins from a share perspective, just absent any kind of specific OEM programs and other factors. So, maybe just your thoughts on that. And then the second part is just on the parts business, obviously, has been kind of a choppy past few quarters, but the commentary seems to be more positive, whereas some of the dealers and OEMs that have reported recently have flagged softness there. So I'm just curious, is that just kind of an absence of customer destocking that you went through last year or better just fleet utilization? What's driving that? If you can things. Thank you. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And as you noted, I mean, we work to create customer pull for the heavy-duty product across different segments. But generally, as you said, for the vocational segment, we have stronger customer pull compared to the truckload, and that's the portion of the market that's been stronger right now. But of course, our goal is always to have the best product and create demand for Cummins products. But as you see that shift between the different segments of market and what OEMs are doing around incentives that could -- as well as capacity that can shift around a little bit over time. On the parts, it's somewhat demand driven and also this inventory destocking was a pretty big factor. There was a focused effort last year to reduce some of the inventory levels that have been carried because of the disruptions that we were all seeing and coming back down to more normal inventory levels. It was a little bit hard to separate between destocking and demand in the market. And so now you see us settling into what we see as pretty steady and solid demand in both our on- and off-highway markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Noah Kaye : Thanks. Maybe hoping to get an update on demand in the order books for the X15? And how is it looking for the back half? How is it tracking the expectations and basically what's the response so far from the OEs? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. No, we are launching that product this month. with PACCAR excited to get it out in the market and then we'll launch it next year with DTNA, so have more offering there. We've got some early demand from some of the big fleet customers that have sustainability goals in the market, and we'll see how that develops over time, really with those fleet and other customers. And so we've projected we could get up to about 8% in the market, but I think it's going to take some time for us to get up to that. that level and for that market to develop in these operating costs and sustainability goals to drive demand up. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the engine slowdown that you're projecting for the second half of the year and maybe try and carry this into early 2025 because I think there's a perception that we're weak for a quarter or two and then the pre-buy kicks in and we're off to the races. When do you believe we start to show positive comparisons potentially in North American engines? And then we have an election this November, and I don't really know which way it's going, but just any thoughts on how a Republican victory or a Democratic victory might change the outlook for engines or new power? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So in terms of the heavy-duty demand, we all wish we had a crystal ball that could project how this is going to play out. This cycle has been very different than past cycles because of the pent-up demand that we had seen and then, of course, getting into pre-buy expectations. So it's really difficult to predict at what point next year we'll start to see improvement and economic conditions will certainly play a role in that. So I'm not going to project exactly when, but I think at some point in next year, we'll see recovery. And we've taken the steps to be prepared for that softening over the next few quarters. In terms of the election, again, I'm not going to make a prediction on that one either. What I will say is, as always, we worked in the past with the Trump administration, and we worked with the Biden administration. We worked across party lines to make sure that the opportunities and the challenges in our industry are understood and that regulation and policy reflects appropriately what those are. We will continue to do that in particular with the regulations that are in front of us. and our destination strategy at its core is about recognizing the economic importance of commercial and industrial applications and a need to decarbonize that industry over time and how do you take the appropriate steps to regulation and incentives to do that. So we're going to continue advocate for that. And some of the money that has come out of the inflation production Act has been allocated and is flowing into the market and creating jobs across the United States. So we'll continue to do that [indiscernible] those points and the opportunities and challenges that we're facing and how we navigate the energy transition. I think Cummins is really well positioned, regardless of how that plays out, but the industry, of course, is making investments in preparing for that. And so we want to make sure that we have stability and regulation, most importantly. Mark Smith : And I just -- I know there's a lot of questions about heavy duty. But as we mentioned earlier, the demand for medium duty is getting stronger. We're actually investing to raise capacity over time, partly because of the strength of the market part because of the new business we've won. So right now, the expectation is that less volatility and a sustained high demand is what we're being told right now. Things can change based on the economy. But there's more question marks about heavy. Clearly, it's going down in the near-term and a lot less questions about medium duty for now. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Kyle Menges with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Kyle Menges : Thank you. I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the power systems and really focus on the unit outlook and how to think about capacity for the remainder of the year and then how you think about you could exit the year from a capacity standpoint or just doing the math, it seems like. And assuming you're running pretty hot from a capacity standpoint, it seems like unit shipments capacity for the year would be around 20,000 or so units. I'm curious what that might look like the capacity on an annualized basis exiting the year and looking into 2025 with some of the investments you're making? Mark Smith : Well, there's a lot of there, unfortunately, in that business, there's more variation, right? There's just such a wide range of engines and applications. And so it's not a -- unfortunately, it's not a simple explanation as it would be, say, for on-highway markets where there's a narrower range of products across the market. I don't think there's going to be dramatic capacity increases this year, but we're working towards, obviously, supporting the one key global secular theme, which is the data center capacity, Jenny Bush talked about at Analyst Day. That's the one. It varies by segment, some of our more consumer-facing segments demand has dropped over the last 18 months. So there's some more capacity there. So it very much depends by end market. But the general theme is some investment in capacity, some reorganizing where we make product around the world. We feel confident about the revenue guide for this year. We feel confident we can support through our production revenue going into next year. But unfortunately, I just because of the variation in the products, the pricing, the applications that like a rule of thumb on the unit isn't quite as applicable in that segment. Jennifer Rumsey : Yeah. The only thing I'll add to Mark's comments, which are absolutely accurate is, in particular, the data center market. What you've seen happen in the first half of the year was we worked really hard on our supply base and production and the 95 liter, which is running now at capacity, and then we launched the Symptoms product, which adds -- adds additional platforms, including a 78-liter that's able to run at this 3-megawatt key data center point. And so helped us the supply chain improvement as well as the new product launches helped us increased revenue and what we're selling into the market. But we're continuing to run into capacity constraints on some of the platforms in that data center market, in particular, which is why we're making some modest investments to be able to take up capacity over the next couple of years. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clulow for any closing remarks. Chris Clulow : Thanks, everybody, for participating today. That concludes it for today. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions further after the call and throughout the rest of the week. Thank you. Bye. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Q3 2024 Cummins Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Christopher Clulow : Thanks, Julian. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the third quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. I will now turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter accomplishments and financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our financial performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the third quarter. In September, we started full production of our X15N natural gas engine at our Jamestown Engine plan, which is the first version of our 15-liter helm platform to launch in the U.S. the X15N delivers performance, durability and power required in a variety of applications and is an excellent alternative for fleet looking to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. This is an important milestone in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy as we work to reduce the impact of our products today while investing in cleaner power solutions for the future. Some of North America's largest and most demanding heavy-duty fleets are actively engaged with Cummins, following their own tests of the natural gas engine in the field. For example, UPS has purchased 250 Kenworth X15N powered trucks in a move the company highlights as an important part of decarbonizing its ground fleet. Cummins had the opportunity to further showcase our Destination Zero strategy in action through our diverse portfolio of power solutions at the recent IAA transportation event in Hannover, Germany. At this event, we displayed our fully integrated powertrain concept featuring our helm engine platforms and e-components. I also personally had an opportunity to hear feedback from Cummins' customers on the challenges they are experiencing with their decarbonization strategies. Common remains confident that our customers' needs will not be met with a single solution. And this event was a great opportunity to further demonstrate that Cummins and Accelera have the right components in our portfolio to provide the necessary solutions for our customers and their needs as they evolve over time. In addition, in October, Accelera by Cummins celebrated the opening of its electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Spain. The plant has a capacity to produce 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year, scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year in the future. The sustainably designed facility is expected to create 150 highly skilled jobs in the region with the potential to reach 200 jobs as production grows, and will help scale up development, manufacturing and adoption of zero emissions technologies in Europe. Lastly, I'd like to express that our hearts are with those who were impacted and are still recovering from Hurricanes Helene and Milton here in the U.S. We are grateful that our employees in the impacted areas are all accounted for and safe. While we did see minor impacts in our third quarter financial results, I'm proud of how our Cummins employees rallied together to help impacted employees, communities and facilities, and respond to this tragedy while minimizing disruption in our industry. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remains strong across many of our key markets and regions, offset by softening in the North America heavy-duty truck market that was in line with our expectations. Sales for the quarter were $8.5 billion, flat compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by continued high demand in our global power generation markets and improved pricing. This was offset by lower North America heavy-duty truck volumes and the reduction in sales from the separation of Atmus. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the third quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded the reduction in margin from the Atmos separation. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 1% to $5.2 billion as a softening heavy-duty market, lower light-duty volumes and a reduction in sales from the Atmos separation were mostly offset by strong demand in the medium-duty truck and power generation markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 68,000 units, down 10% from 2023 levels, while [indiscernible] unit sales were $25,000, down 14% from a year ago. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 12% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 18%. We shipped 28,000 engines Vistalantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of 2024, down 31% from 2023. Revenues in North America Power generation increased by 18%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our third quarter international revenues increased by 2% compared to last year. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 4% as weaker domestic truck and construction volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium heavy-duty trucks in China was 207,000 units, a decrease of 15% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with continued weak domestic diesel market and now softening natural gas orders as the diesel gas price differential narrows. The light-duty market in China was down 4% from 2023 levels at 424,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 30,000, an increase of 14%. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter was 44,000 units, an increase of 10% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 14% as a result of QSM 15 penetration of both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China roughly doubled in the third quarter, primarily driven by continued growth in data center demand. Third quarter revenue in India, including joint ventures, was $641 million, a decrease of 12% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 12%, while our shipments decreased by 18%, driven by a slowdown in manufacturing and government infrastructure spending. Power generation's revenues increased 49% year-on-year, driven by prebuy demand for stationary power out of the CPCB4 emissions regulation changes as well as increased data center demand. Now let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Our revenue outlook for 2024 remains consistent with our prior guidance of down 3% to flat. We are improving our overall EBITDA guidance for the year to be approximately 15.5%, the top end of our prior guide of 15% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue and stronger profitability in our Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting lower revenue and profitability expected in our Components segment. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024. In the third quarter, we saw industry demand softening in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect further softening in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are also maintaining our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023 as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength of vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 units in 2024, with the planned model year changeover likely to drive sharp, but temporary production decline in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to decrease 4% in 2024 as a continued weak domestic diesel truck market is partially offset by higher power generation demand. While we have not yet seen a material impact from the recent stimulus actions, we are encouraged that the emphasis on demand side policies is a positive step forward to build economic momentum in China. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 1% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation demand, which is offsetting lower on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be down 5% to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance due to weaker demand in China. We are maintaining our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 15% to 20%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, also consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, our guidance remains at flat to up 5% for 2024, with some softening in rebuild demand expected in the fourth quarter. In summary, we are maintaining our guidance on sales of down 3% to flat and improving our EBITDA guidance to be approximately 15.5%. Our performance in the third quarter, particularly in our Power Systems and Distribution segments resulted in strong profitability despite a softening North America heavy-duty truck market. While we do expect continued softening in several of our key markets in the fourth quarter, we are committed to delivering strong financial performance and returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. I continue to be grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers while also achieving strong financial performance. Our impressive third quarter results and improved full year guidance continue to demonstrate that we remain well positioned to invest in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and improve financial performance cycle over cycle. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong revenue and profitability in the third quarter. Given the strength, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance and have increased our expectations for EBITDA percent to be at the top end of our prior guidance range. Third quarter revenues were $8.5 billion, flat from a year ago as organic growth offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America decreased 1%, while international revenues gained 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales a year ago. That those year ago numbers included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. The benefits of pricing, strong operational efficiency and the absence of the Atmus separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now let's look at each line item in a bit more detail. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 25.7% of sales compared to $2.1 billion or 24.6% last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing, which varied across our different segments, and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 13.8% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 14.3% last year, which included costs related to the separation of Atmus. Joint venture income of $99 million decreased $19 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees in our engine business, costs incurred in the start-up of the AMPLIFY Cell Technologies, our battery cell joint venture, which is reported within Accelera and was formed last quarter. Other income was $22 million, an increase of $29 million from a year ago or improvement, driven by mark-to-market gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance. Interest expense was $83 million, a decrease of $14 million from prior year, primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.2%, including $36 million or $0.26 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $809 million or $5.86 per diluted share compared to $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share in 2023. EPS benefited from the increased earnings and also a lower share count resulting from the tax-free share exchange associated with the separation of Atmus that was completed in the first quarter. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $640 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow was an inflow of $65 million, which included $1.9 billion of payments required by the previously disclosed settlement agreement with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, third quarter year-to-date operating cash flow was $2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first 9 months of last year. The lower operating cash flow this year is primarily due to higher inventory. We do expect to see stronger operating cash flow in the fourth quarter this year. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations of Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation, which occurred on March 18. Components revenue was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 16% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 13.6% of sales to 12.9%, driven primarily by the dilutive impact of the Atmus separation and a weaker heavy-duty truck market in North America. Several facilities within our Drivetrain and Braking Systems business in North Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene at the end of Q3, disrupting production and causing us to record some costs in our third quarter results. Our employees have shown incredible resilience in extremely challenging circumstances and are working very hard to raise production levels. For Components, we expect 2024 full year revenues to decrease 12% to 15%, a decrease of 2% from the prior guidance at the midpoint, and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.3% to 13.8%, lowering the range from our previous guide of 13.7% to 14.2%. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.7%, an increase from 13.5% a year ago due to operational improvements and positive pricing, including a retroactive pricing agreement in our light-duty business that was finalized within the third quarter. The benefits from pricing and lower operating costs more than offset weaker North American heavy-duty truck volumes. In 2024, we project revenues for the Engine business to be down 2% to [ 1% ], narrowing the range of the prior guidance, and EBITDA to be in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, consistent with our communication last quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 16% from a year ago to a record $3 billion, driven by increased demand for power generation products particularly for data center applications. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales 12.5% compared to 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 8% to 11%, an increase of 2% at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to stronger power generation markets. EBITDA margins are now expected in the range of 11.5% to 12%, also up from our previous guide of 11.3% to 11.8%. Results for the Power Systems segment set another new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.7 billion, an increase of 17%, and EBITDA increased from 16.2% to 19.4% of sales, driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements. In 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be 8% to 11%, an increase of 4% at the midpoint from our prior guide. EBITDA expectations have also increased to approximately 18.3% to 18.8%, up from 17.75% at the midpoint of the prior guide. Accelera revenues increased 7% to $110 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $115 million compared to a loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected while reducing costs in areas where we assess the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million, both unchanged from last quarter. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the third quarter particularly in Power Systems and Distribution, we're improving the full year company guidance for profitability. We still project 2024 company revenues to be down 3% to flat. Company EBITDA margins are now expected -- projected to be approximately 15.5%, which is at the top end of our prior guidance range. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5% for the full year 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items, and down from our prior guidance of an expected tax rate of [ 24 ]. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. In summary, we delivered strong sales and record profitability in the third quarter of 2024. We will experience moderation in some markets in the fourth quarter, most notably North America heavy-duty truck. We have updated our projection for EBITDA to the high end of the prior guidance range due to strong execution, particularly the projected record full year EBITDA in Power Systems and Distribution. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forwards, leaving us well positioned to navigate any further economic cyclicality. We are on track to continue our trend of raising performance cycle over cycle whilst continuing to invest in the future. And that's encouraging given that this is projected to be a down year for North American heavy-duty truck production. Our priorities for the remainder of this year for capital allocation remains to reinvest for profitable growth, pay out our strong cash dividends and support our strong credit rating. Thanks for your interest today. Now let me turn it back to Chris. Christopher Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Now we'll begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steven Fisher, UBS. Steven Fisher : Congrats on the beat and raise. It's hard to find those in machinery world these days. Nevertheless, I think there were some investors that were a little concerned that maybe the Q4 guidance looks a little conservative after the strong Q3. I don't know how much of that is related to the storm impact in Components. But I guess the bigger picture question here is, even though it's maybe a little early, do you think there are enough positives to offset the rest of the downturn that we have in the heavy-duty truck market, however long that may last to keep EBITDA growing over the next year? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So let me just comment first, Steve. Thanks. Great to hear from you. Let me comment a little bit on the fourth quarter and what we expect. There's really 3 factors that I'd point to in the revenue guide for fourth quarter. We expect further softening in the heavy-duty market. I talked about the product changeover with [indiscernible] that will drive further volume reduction in that pickup truck business. And then just working days with year-end will be fewer, and we see across many of our markets, fewer working days associated with the holidays and normal maintenance and [indiscernible] during that period of time. So those are really the factors. As you can see, we're -- the team has done a great job of continuing to focus on profitability across the business, delivering strong decremental margins where we've seen reductions in heavy-duty, which takes a lot of effort. I just want to acknowledge the great work of the team and then leveraging some of the places that we have strength with really strong performance, of course, power gen that impacted Power Systems and DB. And we expect that to continue as we go into next year. Steven Fisher : Okay. And maybe just building on that last part there, I mean, how would you describe the momentum in Power Gen right now? I mean, is that new record revenues in the quarter? You're sold out on the 95 liters. Where are you on the capacity utilization on 50 and 78? What's driving the further upside from here? Is it mainly pricing? Or can you kind of push out more volumes? Jennifer Rumsey : It's really both. So over the course of this year, we've worked on strategic pricing and offsetting some of the inflationary costs that we've seen and pricing for value in that business. And we've been working on capacity in the supply base and our own operational improvements and launching the new [indiscernible] product. So all of those things have given us improvement over the course of the year. 95-liter is at capacity, but we've been able to increase capacity through these improvements by about 30% on that product in '24 of the new products. And then as we talked about previously, we are investing right now to double capacity in the 95-liter. That will come online late next year as we go into '26. We don't see any end in sight in terms of demand in that market. We're the rebuilds up on the 95-liter out the [ '27 ]. So really focused on how do we leverage the capacity we have now, investment we have now while we're bringing more online late next year. Mark Smith : And I think, Steve, the only thing I'd add to your first question is, we're not -- we're building our plans with a relatively modest start on heavy-duty truck to the first half of next year with what we see right now. So hear your comments and questions, and we're very focused on kind of managing through the cycle. Jennifer Rumsey : I will say, I mean, in terms of the impact of Helene and Milton, we're back to regular operation in that business and trying to just work through some of the backlog that built up during the period that we were most severely impacted, but it's been a really tremendous effort by the team there. We have multiple facilities in the Western North Carolina region within Cummins Drivetrain and breaking systems that have been dealing with the impact of that working. Operator : Our next question comes from Angel Castillo, Morgan Stanley. Angel Castillo Malpica : Congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into some of the dynamics that are maybe impacting the next couple of years. I saw some headlines around maybe the California Omnibus low NOx regulation, and some states maybe delaying the kind of model year '25 to maybe model year '26 type enforcement. Just any comments or maybe read-throughs to what maybe that tells you about the underlying kind of enforcement of those regulations and the potential for kind of prebuy into '25, just any broader read-through to maybe or just industry demand for your engines? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean what we've seen, of course, this year is the [indiscernible] bus regulations have gone into place. As we get into '27, we see commonization again between EPA and CARB, which we believe is a positive for the industry. What happens between now and then in terms of different states following those CARB regulations, as you noted some have pushed out, it's a little bit difficult to predict. But certainly, you see lower volumes this year in CARB even with some of the flexibilities that they've put in place to sell 200-milligram NOx product and strong demand nationwide. And so we're watching that space closely. I would say, overall, as Mark noted, we're projecting softening as we go into next year in the heavy-duty truck market and then still anticipating, depending on economic conditions, the prebuy likely starting at some point during '25 ahead of the '27 regulations. Angel Castillo Malpica : That's very helpful. And then just wanted to circle back on the prior question around 2025 for power generation. I think you indicated you kind of see growth in power systems and momentum continuing there. Just curious, it seems like your power generation guide of 15% to 20% was unchanged despite continued strong performance there. Can you talk about 2025, just early indications based on your backlog? Should we anticipate kind of that 15% to 20% type growth to persist into next year? Or how do you kind of see that based on kind of pricing and backlog indications today? Jennifer Rumsey : I mean, really that demand in that market is going to remain strong. So it's all about what we can do in terms of capacity and managing our supply base. Mark Smith : And that's one of the factors that gives us confidence going at the start of the year, that strong backlog and then, of course, distribution should be -- continue to be pretty resilient absent a big economic shock. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Menges, City. Kyle Menges : I was hoping I noticed within Power Systems, the Industrial portion actually pretty strong growth in the quarter despite certainly some competitors not showing great results in mining this quarter. So just would love to hear kind of what's driving that reacceleration and growth in that industrial portion and just how you're thinking about that into 4Q and into 2025? Jennifer Rumsey : I mean, overall, our guidance is pretty flat in the mining market. We've seen some rebuilds demand that you're seeing in those results, but really not significant shifts in that market right now. Christopher Clulow : Yes. I think overall, Kyle, I'd just add, yes, the mining is really the key market for us in the industrial side, as you know, and that has remained pretty resilient from our perspective, where it's moved a little down the world. We've maintained a pretty good both in the first-fit side as well as in the aftermarket, which drives the rebuild. Mark Smith : Don't overread in one quarter it. Kyle Menges : Got it. And then just a follow-up on Power Systems. -- looks like with the new guidance going to be doing incrementals of about 60% in 2024. So it would be helpful if you could frame just how we might think about incremental margins in that segment and in 2025? And I guess why wouldn't it be kind of close to 40% to 60% again? And what factors maybe could cause weaker incrementals next year for that... Mark Smith : I do get a use of pushing the Power Systems business a bit hard, so I'll probably stay off the 40% to 60%, but here's what I'd say. Part of the improvement was really a reprioritization and cost kind of reset at the start of this journey, which has really been going on for a couple of years now. So you get that benefit early on, and then there's been a lot more focus on pricing capacity and efficient capacity improvements. So yes, we still think there is more to come on the top line and the bottom line. I don't think we can continue to expect 40% to 60% incremental margins. We will provide specific updates here in February. But with what we know today, we would expect more improvement going into next year. Operator : And our next question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you folks can just expand on the margin performance in engine, really outstanding results in the third quarter. The guidance implies margin expansion in the fourth quarter on lower sales. You mentioned operating efficiencies in the prepared remarks. Can you just expand on where those efficiencies are versus pre-COVID levels? And it feels like there's momentum into '25 even if demand is softer, just given where the exit rate looks to be in the fourth quarter versus the cost structure in the first. But I'm wondering if you could just expand around those points, if you don't mind? Mark Smith : Yes. I think there's been a lot of improvement pre-COVID, no doubt about that, but we're still not all the way back to those kind of 2019 operating levels. So I still think there's more room to come on operational efficiencies. And then we've talked about kind of being at the peak part of this investment cycle. Of course, the strong medium-duty demand has really helped in this environment and our positions continue to strengthen there. So that's really helped. And whilst we have flagged, and it is going to happen, there is going to be short, but sharp reduction in pickup truck engine production in the fourth quarter, we view that as largely temporary. And I think that with all the information we have today that that's going to resume. So I think the top line will face some first half year pressure on heavy duty relative to the first half of this year, but yes, continuing to focus on operating costs. I mentioned briefly in my remarks that we've really been making adjustments to our organization structure and costs since for the fourth quarter of last year. And whilst that hasn't been dramatic in any period, I think that helps set us up well going into next year. Just so you didn't miss it, I did point out not to make a huge deal, but we did get some extra pricing, which helped in the third quarter that was retroactive back to the start of the year. So we won't get all of that again in the fourth quarter, but nevertheless, I think the cost base, the operational efficiencies, maybe not in the short term, but maybe in the medium term, we get some boost from China as well because our earnings are okay, but far from what the full potential of China is in the engine business. So I think there's a lot to look forward to, but the exact timing of earnings accelerating the engine business isn't clear yet. So we've kind of got to focus on the cost and efficiency certainly through the next 9 months. Jerry Revich : Super. And can I shift gears and ask about the natural gas engine demand now that you've opened up a full rate production. Can you just update us on your expectations of natural gas share in the market 6 to 12 months out based on the demand and the performance of the production ramp that you alluded to in the prepared remarks, please? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean we've said that we think we could get up to a -- potentially 8% share in the market with the natural gas product. We had several big fleets that we're testing it during development. And I noted the [indiscernible] UPS has played. So how they start to ramp up volume, get increasing confidence in the strong performance and efficiency. Fundamentally, in most places, it can provide, not only a reduction in CO2 for fleets that want to lower the CO2 footprint, but also reductions in operating costs because of the fuel price differential between natural gas and diesel. And so fleets that are interested in pursuing that, I think over time, we'll ramp up a target for me to exactly predict because it also depends on some of the economic conditions that are impacting [indiscernible] today of what that will be over 12 months. But we're excited to have that product out now with Kenworth and Daimler will be launched as well in '25. So they'll be positioned with that in the market also. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Cook, Truist Securities. Jamie Cook : Nice quarter. I guess my first question, you guys have talked about adding capacity on the large engine side. One of your peers came out last quarter and talked about adding even additional capacity in large engines because of demand. So I'm wondering if you're making any changes to your capacity increase that you've talked about historically? And then to what degree do -- how much incremental capacity are you adding that could potentially benefit 2025? And then my follow-up question, Mark. Again, I know someone asked the questions on Q4 versus Q3 margins, and there's an implied step down, but how much was that repricing that you talked about that helped the engine business that maybe we view as onetime? And then within Components, how much of an impact was the hurricanes? Jennifer Rumsey : Thanks, Jamie. I'll take the first one and let Mark take the second one. So over the course of this year, what you've seen is new products for power generation, capacity within the constraints of the equipment and our supply chain that we have today going up about 30% on the 95-liter. And so that, of course, is going to carry over into next year. And the mantra and power systems right now is just one more, and how do we continue to squeeze every shift, every day, one more out of what we have within our current constraints. And so we'll continue to focus on that and then, of course, working to try to get that doubling of capacity for the 95 by next year. We're continuing to look at it. We want to be smart about where we can make reasonable investments to take capacity up further where we see strong market conditions. So nothing really specific to say right now, but just that we're continuing to look at our footprint and where there may be opportunities. Mark Smith : On the second part, the first thing I said, we're going to get natural -- I will answer the specific questions you Jamie. I just want to share that we're going to get natural variations from quarter-to-quarter, but I just want to remind that we're very focused on the cost side, on the efficiency side, of course, getting value for the products, which are helping our customers be successful is also important. So yes, the the kind of retroactive element of the pricing was about 50 basis points ballpark for the company in the quarter. There is a go-forward benefit just not as much as that. And then the costs you're talking you're talking low tens of millions of dollars between components and the elimination segment where we incurred some costs for the impacts of Hurricane Helene. So there are puts and takes. There are some positives, there are some negatives in the results. I think the revenue guide, you can see we haven't changed because we are very clear the heavy, medium and pickup truck production and the way that the very well-run customers like to work is to have predictability around the production level. So I think the revenue is well pinned. And I think the key for us is maintaining this strong cost and efficiency discipline as we go into next year and continue to focus on preparing ourselves for more demand and growth in the future and raising these margins as we set out at the Analyst Day and generating more cash, that's a big focus. Operator : Our next question comes from Tami Zakaria, JP Morgan. Tami Zakaria : Good morning. Thank you so much. So I sort of adding one more question on incremental margin because I think it's really the start of your performance in recent quarters. So when I look at your incremental margin in the third quarter, it's almost 50% ex the filtration separation, which is quite impressive versus a long-term target of over [ 25 ]. So do you believe your incremental margin target can move up for the long term given the pargeneration product success, engines are seeing some retroactive pricing as well it seems and you have a lot of new products coming in, in the next couple of years. So would you consider revisiting your long-term incremental EBITDA margin target as you begin next year? Mark Smith : I don't think -- I think we'll give guidance just for the year, and then we'll see how we do. There's a lot of moving parts to our portfolio. Of course, we're feeling like we've done a pretty good job in our core business. Since we had our Analyst Day, incrementally, there have been more headwinds to the Accelera side of the business. But overall, we're pleased with this year. Let's focus on finishing strong for this year. We'll give you our full guidance with all its technicolor when we get to February. So I appreciate the question, but today, we're not going to talk about longer-term targets. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer, Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : Just a clarification. On the retroactive pricing, I wonder if you can describe what that is or how much continues? And more fundamentally, whether that indicates that you have any enhanced pricing power through engines, if that was something new and different and then I have a more substantial question after that. Mark Smith : I don't think we should read anything into it other than it's been a protracted discussion. It's back to January 1 Rob. So that's just sometimes things take a while to resolve. Christopher Clulow : Yes. As a reminder, Rob, that's in our light-duty space. So it was more localized there. Robert Wertheimer : Perfect. Okay. That helps a lot. Just more fundamentally, obviously, you and largest competitor in large engines are seeing a lot of demand, and your customers must be telling you that you have a big role to play years and years ahead. Is it very clear that even the biggest hyperscale data centers will use RESIP engines on backup. I wonder if you can just talk about what your customers are telling you about the changing sort of design and scope and scale of data centers and where you fit in for the next decade to come? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean, I think at this point in the next decade, we think reciprocating engines are going to be the solution for backup power. Of course, they're looking at different potential options for prime power and evaluating what that looks like, but other technologies that we might use from from a lead time cost, reliability, it's hard to match what a diesel gen set can do for backup power. So we really think that's going to be a solution for some time. Operator : And our next question comes from David Raso, Evercore. David Raso : Back to the prebuy question, I know we're sitting here on election day, so curious to get your thoughts if anything around the election could alter your thoughts around... Jennifer Rumsey : I'm surprised you made it this far without that question, David. David Raso : Make sure if you could answer the timing of your introduction of a '27-compliant engine, can you take us through your thoughts around that, the idea of maybe introducing that early, building some credits? Obviously, the nat gas engines already are providing some credits as well. Can you just take us through how you're thinking about the timing of your introductions? And obviously, woven within that, anything you want to comment on on whoever wins the White House and Congress how that impacts your thoughts? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean, at the end of the day, Cummins is going to do what we've always done. We're going to work across party lines and engage on issues that are important for our business and our industry, and we'll do that. We've done that with the bid administration of the pass administration will do with the next administration. And what's really important to us and our industry is having that regulatory and legislative stability. And we do not expect any change regardless of the outcome of the election on the [ '27 ] regulations for our industry. So as we have in the past, we're really -- we have a history of being first into the market with products that comply with new regulations and deliver increased value to our customers, and we're always focusing on the landscape, what's the right product at the right time, how do we take -- consider regulatory flexibility and credits as a part of that strategy. And given all that, we do intend to launch the diesel version of the 15-liter helm platform in '26 ahead of the '37 regulation. And with that launch, not only deliver a lower NOx product into the market, but also one that had significant improvement in fuel efficiency and operating costs to decline to 7% efficiency improvement in that product that will deliver value to our customers and then looking to how do we further strengthen our position in that market through these regulatory changes. And this is really consistent with our past strategy, and what's worked well for Cummins over the years is delivering value to our customers through these regulatory changes and strengthening our position in the market. So that's our intention. We've got the 15-liter natural gas out now. We'll add a diesel version of that in '26 and then launch our midrange products at the start of '27. David Raso : The early introduction of the I assume you were thinking first quarter '26 with the new model years. Can you help us though, it appears in the channel there is some sense that there might be a prebuy of your engines in 25 to get in front of that early '26 introduction. Can you help us a bit, a, is that maybe helping some of the truck orders we're seeing in the industry? I mean you are 40% of the trucks out there. So prebuying cummins would impact total industry numbers pretty meaningfully. And the cost of the new '27 engine coming out early in '26, can you give us some sense of the cost to the customer? And the follow-up will be, how much is the warranty versus the components? I'm just trying to get a sense how much you're bring all '27 costs into '26. It's a case of... Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So let me try to frame it to hope you're thinking that, of course, the specifics on pricing, we're still discussing that with customers, the exact timing and transition between the current and the next-generation 15-liter in '26, we're still in discussions with our customers. So I'm not going to give exact answers there. What I will say is that we are adding meaningful engine and aftertreatment content and technology to both comply with the lower NOx regulation as well as deliver better fuel efficiency and operating cost and value to our customers. And that will be added as we launch this new product in '26. The requirement for a longer emissions warranty does not take effect until '27. So customers that buy this this new high-efficiency market-leading products in '26 will not be [indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : And related to this transition, I guess, is probably one of the biggest R&D investments the company has ever made. So as we start to kind of get past that. Can you maybe think -- help us think about the direction of R&D spend? It seems like maybe an obvious place to get leverage on future growth. But you did $1.5 billion of spend in '23, going to be around that range for '24. How should we think about that level of spending going forward? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean you've got it. We're investing at a record level, high level with these new platforms that we're bringing into the market. We think those will position us well for the future. And so you'll see some normalization of that. Now the exact shape of that is going to depend, frankly, on how regulations evolve and what the -- what I call the bridge period of technology looks like and how that transitions to zero emissions. But we'll see that coming off of our peak as we get past the '27 product launches, and we'll continue to be investing in R&D to create differentiation and value in the market to grow the business over the long term. Noah Kaye : So if you're launching next -- late next year -- or sorry, I think you said '26, then implies we'll start to back down on those peaks. Jennifer Rumsey : [indiscernible] Noah Kaye : Okay. And then just sort of switching gears -- can you characterize the durability of strength in medium duty. I think the 6 and 7 classes have done pretty well. There's still some backlog there. but just talk about the demand you're seeing now in the market and whether that kind of continues into next year. You already kind of commented on some of your expectations for heavy duty. So medium-duty color would be helpful. Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean, for the year, we're seeing medium -- North America medium-duty up a little bit, flat to up 5%. We're continuing to see pretty strong demand. I mean you've seen a little bit of inventory and normalization of backlog, but we continue to see really strong demand. And with future regulations on that horizon, we expect that's likely to continue into next year. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim  Thein, Raymond James. Timothy Thein : The first question is just on the Distribution business. And I'm curious what, if any, mix impact, there could be given the -- if you look at the strength that we've seen and you're projecting to continue for some time in power gen, that's now running at, call it, 10 points higher as a percentage of distribution revenues from a couple of years ago. And while some of that's coming as we've seen parts come down. So maybe in historical terms, that's a mix negative, just as the whole goods grows as a percentage of revenues, but maybe just given the strength in demand and tightness in supply, that's not the case. So maybe just your thoughts on just the mix within distribution and how to think about that going forward? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean, as you noted, that typically whole goods is mix margin negative compared to aftermarket for us. If you just step back and look at the business in total, you've got to consider what we've done around inflationary pricing and operational efficiencies have tried to flex up to higher volume, and we're going to continue to focus on those operational efficiencies. But power generation gross revenue mix compared to aftermarket will be negative on the margin line. Timothy Thein : Got it. Okay. And then maybe 1... Mark Smith : Tim, that's where we continue to drive on those operational efficiencies and other areas and, of course, continue to drive as much of the parts business as we can underline. But the most important thing is we're meeting customer expectations and growing earnings in an efficient way. Timothy Thein : Got it. And then, Mark, just on the gross margin color that you gave earlier, was the -- you highlighted pricing several times. Was there -- was that -- was all of that from this retroactive deal you had in the light duty? Or was there maybe just... Mark Smith : I mean year-over-year, there's other pricing, it just -- it was appropriate for the engine to note for the engine business that that was a particular fact. But no, there was other pricing and the overall expectations haven't significantly changed for the rest of the business. Quite frankly, this other pricing we'd expect it to get it at the start of the year and it's just taking time. The most important thing is it's been reset. It's more of a timing issue and a concentration in Q3, we always anticipated something in our full year numbers. So on a full year basis, there's not much to say, but it just came in a more lumpy fashion because of the catch-up nature. Operator : Thank you for our last question. I would now like to turn the floor back to Chris Clulow for closing remarks. Christopher Clulow : Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate everyone joining today. That concludes our teleconference. I appreciate your participation and continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Operator : We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you please ask one question, one follow-up, then return to the queue. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Joining us today are Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey; Vice President and CFO, Mark Smith; and Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I'll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to start us off. Jennifer Rumsey : Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of 2024, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2025. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. As I reflect back on 2024, I am pleased to share that we delivered strong financial results with records in several parts of the business while also making significant progress in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy. I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders, and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on advancing our strategy and executing our financial commitments as we lead the energy transition. It continues to be clear that our multi-solution Destination Zero strategy that leverages advancements and solutions from both our core and Accelera by Cummins businesses will continue to position us to succeed. We demonstrated this in 2024 as we further strengthened our position through evolving our portfolio and expanding and establishing relationships with new and longstanding key stakeholders and partners. Most notably for our core business in 2024, we introduced the Cummins HELM engine platform. Applied across Cummins' legendary B, X10, and X15 series engine portfolios, the HELM platforms provide customers with the option to choose the fuel type, either advanced diesel or alternate fuels like natural gas and hydrogen, that best suits their business needs and offers the power and performance customers expect while also reducing emissions. Cummins began full production of the X15N natural gas engine at the Jamestown Engine Plant earlier this year. And we are actively engaged with some of North America's largest and most demanding heavy-duty fleets as they look to reduce their carbon footprint. Additionally, in our core business, we introduced four new generator sets to the award-winning Centum Series, two each powered by Cummins' QSK50 and QSK78 engines. In response to high market demand, these new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers. In order to further raise our capacity to meet rising power generation demand, we also intend to invest $200 million across our U.S., England, and India manufacturing sites. As you will see in our full year financial performance details and 2025 guidance, we are excited about the continued impressive performance and growth potential for our Power Systems business. Cummins also successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. The separation of Atmus resulted in the tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced Cummins' shares outstanding by approximately 5.6 million in the first quarter. In our Accelera business, we completed the formation of our joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies with Daimler Trucks & Buses PACCAR, and EVE Energy to localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. This strategic collaboration will advance zero emissions technology for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications. Amplify began construction this year of a 21-gigawatt hour factory in Mississippi with potential for future expansion as demand grows and is targeting start of production in 2027. Lastly, as we navigate this long and messy transition for our customers, we remain committed to pacing and refocusing our investments on the most promising paths as the adoption of zero-emission solutions slows in some regions around the world. As you can see in our fourth quarter results, we recorded charges related to the reorganization of our Accelera business segment as we underwent a strategic review to streamline the business while also ensuring we are set up for long-term success. We remain committed to Accelera and its mission, and this business continues to play an important role in our Destination Zero strategy. Now I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions, offsetting the softening in the North America heavy-duty truck market. Revenues for the quarter totaled $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to 2023 as lower North America heavy-duty and pickup truck volumes and the reduction in sales from the separation of Atmus were partially offset by continued high demand in our global power generation markets, stronger aftermarket, and North America medium-duty truck volumes as well as improved pricing. EBITDA was $1 billion or 12.1% compared to a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2024 results included 312 million of charges related to the strategic reorganization of our Accelera business segment. This compares to the fourth quarter 2023 results, which included $2 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to our voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.8% compared to $1.2 billion or 14.4% a year ago. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volume, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus. 2024 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, essentially flat with 2023 despite the decline in North America heavy-duty truck demand in the second half of the year and reduction of sales from the Atmus separation. EBITDA was a record $6.3 billion or 18.6% of sales compared to $3 billion or 8.9% of sales in 2023. 2024 results include a gain, net of transaction costs and other expenses, of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture, $312 million of charges related to the Accelera reorganization, and $29 million of first quarter restructuring expenses. This compares to the 2023 results that included $2 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $100 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million of costs related to the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.4 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2024 compared to $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded lower second half North America truck volumes and the reduction in margin from the Atmus separation. EBITDA dollars were a record in Power Systems, Distribution, and Engine segments. Our Power Systems business, in particular, finished 2024 with a record full year EBITDA of 18.4% of sales, up from 14.7% in 2023. I'm very pleased with the performance across our core business segments, and you will see from our guidance that we are excited to continue to build on this momentum. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2025 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2025 to be down 2% to up 3% compared to 2024, and EBITDA to be 16.2% to 17.2% of sales, up from 15.7% in 2024. While we expect weaker first half demand in our North America on-highway truck markets, we expect many of our markets, particularly power generation to remain strong throughout the year. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 290,000 units in 2025, flat to down 10% year-over-year. We anticipate weaker first half demand. And while we do expect a prebuy in the second half of the year, the uncertainty on the exact timing and extent is driving our wider guidance range. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 140,000 to 155,000 units, down 5% to 15% compared to 2024, primarily driven by weaker-than-expected recent net orders and a depleting backlog. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 130,000 to 140,000 in 2025, flat to up 5% year-over-year. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 5% in 2025. We are projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy and medium-duty truck demand in China. While export demand is expected to decline slightly, we are hopeful that the recent NS4 scrapping policy and other stimulus actions may lead to domestic demand growth. We have not, however, seen a meaningful recovery thus far. While there is still uncertainty around the China truck market for 2025, we expect strength in other markets, particularly power generation, where demand is expected to remain high as data center momentum continues. In India, we project total revenue, including joint venture to increase 10% in 2024, primarily driven by stronger power generation demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be down 5% to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect flat to down 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2025. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5% to 15%, driven by continued high demand in the data center market. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%. For aftermarket, we expect revenue improvement with a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2025. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million compared to $414 million in 2024. In summary, 2024 was a record year for revenues, net income, EBITDA, and earnings per share. In 2025, we anticipate that demand will be slightly weaker in the North America on-highway truck markets, particularly in the first half of the year but offset by continued strength in the power generation market and resiliency in our Distribution business, given our strong aftermarket presence. Despite a relatively flat revenue forecast, we are expecting to improve profitability and cash flow. We remain committed to our multi-solution approach that is proving to be the right strategy for our customers, for the environment, and for the continued growth of Cummins while also returning cash to investors. Now let me turn it over to Mark who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong operational results in the fourth quarter, which resulted in revenue achieving the top end of our prior guidance and EBITDA margins exceeding our projections. 2024 was a record year for revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share, reflecting the strong demand for our products and the strong hard work of our employees. Now let me go into more details on Q4 and the full year performance. There were some notable non-routine transactions in '24 and 2023, and I'll quantify those and describe our underlying results to give a better understanding of the performance from regular operations. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $8.4 billion, and EBITDA was $1 billion or 12.1% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we underwent a strategic review of our Accelera segment, which resulted in charges of $312 million, of which $305 million were non-cash. Excluding this charge, we delivered EBITDA of $1.3 billion or 15.8% of sales. In the fourth quarter of '23, we reported sales of $8.4 billion and an EBITDA loss of $878 million. Excluding the regulatory settlement, Atmus separation costs, and voluntary retirement and separation program costs in Q4 2023, EBITDA was positive $1.2 billion or 14.4%. I know that's a lot to digest. In summary, on an underlying basis, EBITDA improved by 140 basis points on slightly lower sales, excluding those charges I just described. Fourth quarter revenues decreased by 1% from a year ago as organic growth was more than offset by the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America were flat while international revenues decreased 3%. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by less than 1%. The EBITDA improvement of 140 basis points was primarily due to higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency, partially offset by lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus. Now let me summarize some of the impacts by line item in the income statement. Gross margin was $2.1 billion or 25.4% of sales compared to $2 billion or 23.7% last year. The improved margins were driven by stronger power generation aftermarket demand, favorable pricing, particularly in Power Systems and Distribution and improved operational efficiency. Selling, administrative, and research expenses were $1.1 billion or 13.6% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 14.2% last year due to lower research and development costs. Joint venture income of $87 million decreased $26 million primarily driven by lower technology fees from some of our international partnerships and costs incurred in the ramp-up of the Amplify Cell Technology battery joint venture here in the U.S., which was formed in the second quarter of '24. Other income was negative $25 million, a decrease of $75 million from a year ago, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on investments related to company-owned life insurance. Interest expense was $89 million, a decrease of $3 million from a prior year, driven by lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 32.8%, principally due to non-deductible costs related to the Accelera reorganization. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $418 million or $3.02 per diluted share, which includes $312 million or $2.14 per diluted share of Accelera reorganization charges. Excluding the Accelera charges, EPS was $5.16 per diluted share. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.4 billion, just $37 million lower than the level we saw in the first quarter last year. For the full year 2024, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, slightly above a year ago and reflecting 4% growth if we exclude Atmus from both 2023 and '24. EBITDA in '24 was $6.3 billion or 18.6%. Excluding the gain in costs associated with the separation of Atmus, the Accelera charge in the fourth quarter, and first quarter restructuring expenses, EBITDA in 2024 was $5.4 billion or 15.7%. 2023 EBITDA was $3 billion or $5.2 billion and 15.3% excluding the regulatory settlement, Atmus separation costs, and voluntary retirement and separation programs. The increase in the EBITDA percent was primarily driven by higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiencies, more than offsetting the impact of lower North American heavy-duty truck volumes and the reduction in margin from the Atmus separation. All-in net earnings were $3.9 billion or $28.37 per diluted share compared to $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share a year ago. 2024 results included the gain related to the separation of Atmus, net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion or $9.28 per diluted share, charges related to Accelera reorganization of $2.12 per diluted share, and first quarter restructuring costs of $0.16 per diluted share. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $1.2 billion, flat compared to 2023 as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the HELM platforms within our core business in North America. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And over the past five years, we've returned 54% in the form of share repurchase and dividends even while we absorbed the significant acquisition in the form of Meritor. In 2024, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments, dividend growth, and returning $969 million to shareholders via the cash dividend and debt reduction. We also reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 5.6 million shares from the tax-free Atmus separation share exchange. I will now summarize the 2024 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2025. And thankfully for you and for me, I'm going to exclude all those nonroutine items in the following pages, and thanks for staying with me as I work through that. For the Engine segment 2024 revenues were a record $11.7 billion or up $28 million compared to last year. EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, flat compared to a year ago. In 2025, we project revenues for the Engine business will be down 2% to up 3% due to expected weakness in the North American truck market, particularly in the first half of the year, slightly offset by improved demand in pickup and some international markets. 2024 EBITDA is expected to improve with projections in the range of 14.2% to 15.2%. Components segment revenues were $11.7 billion in 2024, 13% lower than the prior year, and EBITDA was 13.8% of sales compared to 14.4% in '23. There were a lot of work done to improve existing operations but that was offset in the year-over-year comparisons due to the separation of Atmus. For 2025, we expect total revenue for the Components business to range from down 5% to flat as 2024 included Atmus in the first quarter through March 18. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 13.8% and 14.8%. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 11% in '24 compared to 2023 and were a record $11.4 billion. EBITDA was 12.1% compared to 11.8% a year ago, driven by higher power generation volumes and pricing. We expect 2025 distribution revenues to increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 12% to 13%. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $6.4 billion, up 13% over 2023 driven primarily by power generation demand, especially data center applications. EBITDA was 18.4% or 370 basis points higher than 2023, driven by stronger volume, favorable pricing, and a continued focus on operational performance and cost reduction. In 2025, we expect Power Systems revenues to be at 2% to 7% and EBITDA to improve again and be in the range of 19% to 20%. Accelera revenues increased to $414 million in 2024 with a net operating loss of $452 million as we lowered costs in existing operations, partially offset by additional losses in the Amplify cell joint venture as it advances its operations. In 2025, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million and net losses to reduce to $385 million to $415 million as we continue to make targeted investments aligned with market demand whilst reducing cost. We currently project 2025 company revenues to be down 2% to 3%. Company EBITDA margins are projected to be approximately 16.2% to 17.2% compared to an equivalent 15.7% in 2024. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be 24.5%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and profitability in 2024, including strong results in the second half of the year even as demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a focus as we enter 2025, enabling us to continue investing in new products for new and existing markets, returning cash to shareholders, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Last May, we laid out our updated financial targets through 2030. Our strong performance in 2024 represented encouraging progress towards those targets. And despite a relatively flat revenue forecast and expected weakness in North American heavy-duty truck, we expect to further improve profitability and cash flow in 2025. Thanks for joining us today, and let me turn it back over to Chris. Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please re-join the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Angel Castillo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another strong quarter here. Just wanted to unpack the power generation guide of 5% to 15% a little bit more. Could you just split that out between kind of price and volume? And then maybe just tying into that, I think you mentioned a new investment of 200 million in power gen. Can you just talk about maybe what's entailed in that? I thought, I guess there was already an expansion of doubling capacity so what is kind of the incremental being done? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. So as you said, we're currently in the midst of a $200 million investment across our plants in and see more Minnesota, UK, and India to ramp up capacity to meet what is a growing demand for power generation products. And so you're seeing in that guide and expectation that we have been able to take up capacity. We're continuing to look at strategic pricing and where we can bring value to the customer so you've got some price in there as well. But really, it's about capacity ramp-up and continued sales of larger engines. In the power generation and data center market, it's really the 50 to 60 liter, the 78 and the 95 liters so these are large engines as we're able to bring more capacity online in our supply chain and our plants, you see that flowing through in revenue. And we expect that trend to continue over time. And so we're tracking on plan or even slightly ahead of plan to double our capacity by end of this year and looking forward to being able to meet what is a really strong demand from those customers. Angel Castillo : That's very helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, just on separate on the trucks. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on EPA27? It sounds like you're still assuming some prebuy in the second half. But just given, I guess, what we've seen from the administration so far, any thoughts on the likelihood of any kind of challenges to the EPA27 rule? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, our current view is that we expect the EPA27 regulations will stay in place. Many companies, including us, have been investing over multiple years in those products to bring those products to market, and we're looking forward to having a nationwide standard again in '27. And with that, we are still anticipating some -- both economic recovery and prebuy happening in the North America trucking market that helped bring higher revenue in the second half this year and into next year. We do anticipate there'll be more discussion and potential challenge over the greenhouse gas regulations that we see out into the 2030 and beyond time frame. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Stephen Volkmann : Great. Good morning, everyone. Maybe starting off, can you just talk a little bit more about the Accelera restructuring? And how have you changed the focus of that business? And what are you doing less of or more of or just some color around that? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes, I'll start and then Mark can add if he wants to share more detail. But really, this business has all along been about remaining agile and investing as we see technology advancing and markets starting to move in these zero emissions technologies. And we formed it through a number of acquisitions as well. So what that meant was we had kind of a distributed footprint and investment coming from those different acquisitions, and so we really looked at where we see market moving. We expect that battery electric vehicles will be important in some of our commercial vehicle and industrial applications, and we feel well positioned with the battery cell joint venture and some of the wins that we have with customers as that market develops so we're continuing to invest there. We're continuing to invest but pace investment in electrolyzers as we've seen some slowing in customer demand and uncertainty around incentives there, and then being selective in fuel cells and some of the other technologies where adoption continues to push out. But we think we're well positioned. Frankly, the slower and messier this goes, my view is the better it is strategically for Cummins. And so we're positioning ourselves in the places where we see that market and technology beginning to increase. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, good. Sorry, I thought Mark was going to add something. Can I ask -- well, you've been talking a lot as it is. Hopefully, you'll be doing less of that this year on all these adjustments. Can I just follow up -- can I follow up on the HELM platform? Do you have targets relative to the types of unit volumes you might expect either on the nat gas side or on any of the other engine -- sorry, any of the other fuel options that you can use with that platform? Jennifer Rumsey : We've got -- the rate of -- the beauty of the HELM platform is it's got that fuel flexibility. And so the reality is we're still going to sell a lot of the diesel version of that, and it will be a higher efficiency version, which means lower CO2 and lower fuel costs for our customers. We've set a goal of getting to 8% on the natural gas version of that. We're starting to see customers adopt. PACCAR has launched it. Daimler Trucks will launch that 15-liter natural gas this year. Fleets are testing it. I was with a big customer last week. They're finishing their field testing. They feel good about the product, and they're looking to start to increase penetration, but it really depends on diesel fuel prices and regulation and customer CO2 goals. And so it's hard to give specific numbers on the rate of natural gas or hydrogen adoption because of that dependency on infrastructure cost and regulation. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. In Power Systems, you had a really excellent 30% year-over-year growth in revenue per unit in the quarter, so the ramp in the supply base was progressing nicely. I'm wondering if you could just update us on how much more throughput you expect to get out of the supply base in 2025 for those large products. And I appreciate there could be a wide range of outcomes but would love to get your updated views on that? Jennifer Rumsey : Well, I think it's important to remember that the revenue growth, in particular, for 2024 was also about launching those new Centum products, so we're seeing new products coming online that serve the market in addition to ramping up capacity. And for this year, it really is focused on continuing to max out our capacity capability that we have when we're making the investment and more capacity across that range of products. And the team has done a really phenomenal job of doing that, improving operating efficiency, working with the supply base to try to get as much out of what we have. But there's some major investments that need to happen by the end of this year to really get to the full doubling of capacity. Mark Smith : So unfortunately, Jerry, units are not a great indicator just because the size of the generator set we've been selling is going up. The average selling price has gone up a lot over and above pricing, just the size of the set that we're selling. So the revenue has outgrown the units significant. Jerry Revich : Nice problem to have. And separately on the China truck market, as you mentioned in the prepared remarks, there is some optimism in the market about potentially stronger demand. Can you just calibrate us, I believe, including the JV and wholly-owned business, China truck profits are maybe 10% of total company profits at this point. And given we're at the trough of the cycle, is it fair to think about pretty attractive incremental margins if demand does indeed surprise the upside? Mark Smith : Yes on the latter. I mean, China in total, maybe on a more normal run rate would be in the range of 15% to 20% of our earnings. And yes, on-highway would typically be more than half of that so you're in the ballpark, Jerry, yes. And there's no massive structural investments going on there in the current year. So if we get more volume, we'd expect to convert that into more profits. There's also just some lumpiness around tech fees and other things. But I think the underlying operational business is well set as it's done in prior cycles when demand improves, we see that. And I think that just reinforces how well the Engine business and Components did in '24. Not just did we have weakening heavy-duty truck in the second half of the year but we had weaker China throughout the year. So hopefully, at some point, confident China is going to turn. We don't have a lot of visibility into that right now. Hopefully, that's another leg to come. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tim Thein from Raymond James. Your line is now live. TimThein: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe I'll ask 1 to start on components, Mark. Just as you think about the margin outlook for '25 on flat to down revenues, a pretty nice improvement. I'm wondering how much of that is -- is it maybe a benefit from lapping the Atmus spin or separation? Or is there -- obviously, there's more to it than that. So maybe just a line or two in terms of what you're projecting there for Components. Mark Smith : I think when you look across the company, we've done a lot on cost reduction. It hasn't been enormous in any given quarter, but we've been working at it really since the fourth quarter of 2023 when we announced voluntary separation package. We did a lot of work internally during 2024 to look at how we weighted the amount of resources we put between lines of business, functions, regional structures. And a lot of this work has paid off in terms of improving our cost structure and focus. And so yes, the Components business is going to benefit from some of that. We're not breaking it out separately but what was formerly known as Meritor, Drivetrain, and Braking Systems business, results have continued to improve their underlying. So I think there are a number of things. We are working incredibly hard on a flattish revenue environment to drive cost and efficiency where we can. TimThein: Okay. And then Mark, on the Accelera, just in light of the restructuring and given what's -- how the global backdrop is changing or has changed, the expectation to get that business to EBITDA breakeven by '27, is that still in the cards or you're thinking that maybe is a tougher one to hit? Mark Smith : Yes. I think overall, relative to our 2030 targets for the total company, we feel like we've had a really good start in 2024 and on track. And we're doing a bit better on the core business and headwinds have come more frequently and more severely to Accelera. So we are committed to significant loss reduction. But right now, we are not on track towards that breakeven, but we do feel we're very much on track for the overall company targets. And that's really the reason why we took more pronounced actions or the Accelera team did in the fourth quarter, recognizing that we're not going to get enormous help from demand here in the near term, Tim. So we're managing what we can and in the context of overall company results, we feel confident, but we are not, right now, on track to get to breakeven as we sit here today. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Kyle Menges from Citi. Your line is now live. Kyle Menges : Thank you. I was hoping if you could just comment on how you're thinking about R&D spend in 2025 versus 2024, maybe more specifically within Engine and Components. And then just beyond 2025, how you're thinking about that and how we should be thinking? Mark Smith : Yes, good question. So I think beyond 2025 is where we should see more momentum to the downside on Engine expense. We did see some improvement through the year in the Engine business. We've got a lot of new product launches, both in Engines and Components in 2025. But after we get through those launches and through 2027, that's definitely part of our margin expansion story in those two businesses, but not a dramatic shift this year, some puts and takes between Engines and Components. Kyle Menges : Thanks. That's helpful. And then just could you comment a little bit on how you're thinking about the parts outlook for 2025? Mark Smith : Yes, Parts held up pretty well, in fact, pretty a little bit better than expected in the fourth quarter across our businesses, and so we think in the range of flat to up 5%. Probably some pricing baked in there. So yes, growing in line with the economy, I would say, at least on par with the economy with what we know today. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Truist Securities. Your line is now live. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess similar question that Tim asked on, I think it was the Components business. Just the margins mark in Power Systems are very good despite sort of what I would call a muted top line forecast. So is that just pricing in some of the new products? And then I guess, how do you think about margin targets relative to the ones you just gave us, I guess, last year? Is it looking conservative? And then my second question obviously, lots of puts and takes around tariffs and who knows what happens. But are there any changes in your -- how your terms and conditions or contracts with your customers that if we do get into an environment where tariffs and that causes price increases, that we're able to absorb costs or increase price more frequently relative to last time within Engines, I guess? Mark Smith : Great. So yes, Power Systems doing well. I think continuing to focus on supply chain efficient output. They did a great job last year so I don't want to sound like we're dissatisfied. Quite the opposite, very impressed, but still think there's more to come on raising volume, raising productivity, and a little bit on pricing Power Systems. So all of those things contribute towards raising the margin guidance for the year and quite a bit above the fourth quarter levels. And I guess if we really had a robust U.S. economy, we could see growth in some of the smaller generator sets. We have high market share in some of the consumer segments that are particularly robust. So I guess that -- we don't see signs of that, but if we want to get on to the bullish side and saw more strength in the U.S. economy, that could be another leg to help. On tariffs, by and large, our strategy is to make most of our products in the market in which they're sold. But of course, we do have a global supply chain and we -- of course, nobody knows exactly what the tariff situation is going to be. But to the extent that we do incur them, then we think it's important that the market feels those and we'll look to pass those on. Let's hope that's not significant for everybody involved. But really, we're just focused on controlling what we can control. And I think, yes, we've got secular tailwinds in Power Systems, but the biggest driver is being able to scale growth effectively and pushing out cost. And then you don't see it on the inside but the work we've done inside to try and simplify our structure, improve the speed of decision-making, all of those things help and have helped kind of raise the bar in 2024. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Raso from Evercore. Your line is now live. David Raso : Hi, thank you. I'm trying to better understand the margin expansion in Engines and really, for that matter, of Components. First, the D&A, the growth in the D&A, is that mostly in Engines or Components? It's just the margin improvement is impressive but I'm just wondering it drives it down a little bit because there's more D&A than it is operational, but if you can\u2026? Mark Smith : Well, there is an increase in D&A because that's where we're investing most of the capital in North America, particularly in the Engine business over the last couple of years. David Raso : So of the 100 D&A increase, is it 50 Engines, 25 Components? Just some sense so I can get a better sense of the underlying operation. Mark Smith : Yes, I mean, it won't be significantly in distribution. Power Systems, whilst we're increasing investment is still modest relative to those 2 segments. And so on an incremental basis, most of it is going to go through Engines and Components, a little bit in corporate, which ends up mostly in Engines and Components, yes. David Raso : Okay, that's helpful. And then even with that, it looks like there still is some slight operating, let's say, non-D&A margin improvement in Engines. What's driving that? Is it a little bit of mix? Is it -- I'm just trying to think about maybe the new medium engines you're outperforming the market. How to think about those margins versus heavy? Because it's all wrapped in the idea of trying to figure out where do you think Engine margins are as we sort of move out of '25 and people start to pontificate about earnings power in '26 with the prebuy in the Engine division. Mark Smith : Yes, I think those are all really important questions and will be big contributors to the long-term performance. In the near term, I think we'll continue to expect to do well in the aftermarket side, of which the Engine business is our biggest single driver. So that's probably where there's still some pricing opportunity into 2025. And then yes, the engineering starts coming down enormously, but I think we've come down off the peak there, Components probably going up a little bit. But those would be the main drivers. And as you can see, we haven't factored a lot in from China yet so really, it's cost control and aftermarket in the near term. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Avi Jaroslawicz from UBS. Your line is now live. AviJaroslawicz: Hi, good morning, guys. I guess in terms of your guidance for the market outlook for North America heavy-duty trucks this year, it sounds like if, for whatever reason, you don't do a pre-buy materialized this year that you'd expect retail demand may be still to be negative in the second half. So I guess, one, am I interpreting that correctly? And can you just discuss how you're thinking about it? Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean, I think if you look at the underlying performance in the heavy-duty market, spot rates dropped early in '23, so truckload carriers have really had challenges now for two years, and I think there's a very real chance that we'll see improvement in that over the course of this year, just depending on what the underlying economy and interest rates do. So there's some potential upside in the second half for that in addition to this prebuy phenomenon that we would anticipate would lead to a stronger second half versus first half. The range is quite wide because how high that goes is really dependent on the prebuy and when that starts. AviJaroslawicz: Got it, okay. And then in terms of medium-duty, just breaking down kind of market share gains versus market growth for 2024. How did those net against each other? And then in terms of your sales guidance for this year within Engines, are we thinking about further share gains this year or not as much? Mark Smith : I think really, I think we're talking about following the market in 2025. There's been a long track record of significant market share gains in that market. Our engine is clearly the leader in that market and there were some share gains. But going forwards, it's very much primarily going to be truck in the market, but there can be some modest changes around that from where we are now. Jennifer Rumsey : There is a buy down for the year, it\u2019s reflective of what we've seen in order made in backlog. Mark Smith : Yes. It's industry -- the industry orders, we will feel that, yes. Jennifer Rumsey : From a product perspective, we continue to feel really positive about how our products are performing in the market and our position across medium and heavy duty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. RobWertheimer: Thank you. I had two questions around Power Systems, if I may. And one is, as this data center market continues to develop, historically at least, I suppose, the selling an engine is one thing and then servicing is another. And if you have backup power, it doesn't get turned on that much and it's not as profitable. But obviously, there's a high uptime, high criticality kind of operations. Do you see any opportunity to change that profit algorithm, such that you'll be making more recurring revenue or otherwise on that massive build-out of engines that you're going to do? And then secondly, if I can just wrap it in. You've had excellent results in Power Systems. I'm not sure if all of it's really this surge in data center or maybe the stuff you've touched on a couple of times on the call already, operational improvements. I wonder if you could just expand on how you've made that business better. Jennifer Rumsey : Sure. So first on the data center market, so with power generation and data centers, we have engine, gen sets, and then a good portion of that business also flows through the distribution business. So the strong performance you see in the distribution business last year and the outlook is reflecting the strength in power generation as well as aftermarket. But as you noted, they don't, today, run a lot for backup power. So typically, Parts revenue is relatively low as we look at shortage of power availability, and how do you meet power demand in the U.S. and around the world. There's a potential for some shift in that. And so strategically, we're considering how we think about our role in that, which was part of the discussion on micro-grids and what we do there today, but today, still very much heavily backup power and because of the high reliability demand for those applications. In terms of the Power Systems performance, we undertook now, two years ago, focused effort to really look at operating performance structure, how we made sure, we were investing in the right products, and getting returns on the investments we were making for our customers, and working through some of the supply challenges that have built up through the pandemic, and then the rebound in the market after that. And so that really has come together at exactly the time when this data center trend has also happened. And so we really had strong underlying operating structure and performance in the business that we continue to drive improvement in, as we're also taking up volumes. And so both of those are contributing to really the remarkable profitability improvement that you've seen in Power Systems. Mark Smith : Just to add, Rob, the distribution, of course, adds that extra slice of revenue on data centers. And in fact, it's fundamental to winning and supporting this data center business around the world. I think that's one of the strengths we have and a few others have, and that's why you see that the market demand is concentrated amongst a couple of large engine manufacturers like us because of that service capability. But just to underline what you said, Rob, and your intuition, it would be very wrong to attribute Power Systems improvement just to data centers. That's a journey that's still got legs left but tide -- the performance level has been elevated across that segment, including in the alternator business, which supplies across -- really across that supply chain. So we're incredibly pleased with the way that business has improved. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. So the distribution segment guide, the 2% to 7%, it seems quite healthy. Given the underlying truck market outlook, are you able to comment on the core distribution outlook versus the power generation-related services? The reason I ask, if power generation demand holds at these levels, it seems like distribution could see another double-digit growth year in 2025. So any comments there would be helpful. Mark Smith : Yes. I think you're typically seeing Parts growth maybe slightly above the rate of economic growth. And then in this cycle, you're right, the power generation demand in data centers and in some other applications has really provided that extra leg. So I would say in the short run, yes, power gen will be the main swing factor. I would say that some of the other segments, mining, oil and gas, if we look beyond this year, we'd expect to see more growth in the future. There's not enormous momentum in those businesses, but they're also important end markets for distribution. One of the reasons that we like distribution; it generates a lot of cash. It's less volatile than other parts of the business and have that really strong aftermarket piece, which doesn't get the extraordinary growth rates that underpins the kind of year-to-year level of performance. So yes, distribution is doing well. And hopefully, the global economy strengthens and then all of our businesses will do well. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That's very helpful. And then one follow-up question on that comment that you expect some pre-buy in the back half, but the timing is uncertain. I'm curious what pre-buy lift is embedded in the current heavy-duty and medium-duty outlook for North America? I'm just trying to understand what the market could look like, let's see, if there is no pre-buy. Mark Smith : There are so many factors at play, but that's one of the factors we believe can help. We're going to start off at a fairly modest level in the first quarter. Although orders here yet in the fourth quarter of '24 were a little better than expected, I would say, but it's really, we're anticipating that strength in the second half to come somewhat from demand ahead of the regulations and understanding of how flexible the supply chain is for that industry. Again, I think we've all got fairly consistent views of the market at this point and we'll see how it plays out. A big factor, of course, is going to be the strength of the U.S. economy and spot rates and freight activity. All these factors weigh in. The main thing to know is we've got a stronger second half in heavy-duty truck built into our forecasts. Q1, yes, is going to probably be the low point of the year with what we expect right now. The question is, will we get the improvement in the second half? Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments. Chris Clulow : Thank you, everyone, for joining our teleconference today. That concludes the question-and-answer session. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
