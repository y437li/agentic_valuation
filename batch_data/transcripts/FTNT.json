At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode, but later there will be a chance to ask questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And now, I would like to turn it over to your host, Michelle Spolver. Michelle Spolver - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Good afternoon, everybody and thank you for joining this conference call to discuss Fortinet\u2019s financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2014. Joining me today are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO and Drew Del Matto, CFO. In terms of the structure of the call, Drew will begin with a review of our operating results before turning the call over to Ken to provide additional perspective on our business and product advantages. Drew will then conclude with some thoughts on our outlook for the second quarter and comments on the full year 2014 before we open up the call for questions. As a reminder, today we are holding two calls. For those who have additional or more detailed questions, we are holding a second call at 3 :30 PM Pacific Time. Both calls will be webcast from our Investor Relations website and will be accessible as detailed in our earnings release. Before we begin, let me first read this disclaimer.

A replay of this call will also be available on our website through April 30. Note that we routinely post information on our website and we encourage you to make use of that resource. Before Drew discusses our key financial and operating results for the first quarter, I want to point out that we are making a slight change in revenue classification metrics and specific pro forma items with the goal of simplifying financial disclosure and conforming to more standard reporting practices. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, these pro forma items will now and going forward include stock-based compensation expense, charges related to acquisitions and other significant non-recurring items. There was a minimal positive impact of 0.3% to non-GAAP operating margin, but no impact on the total amount of revenue, non-GAAP gross margins or non-GAAP EPS we are reporting for the first quarter. We are simply reclassifying how we categorize certain revenue items and simplifying our pro forma items to make our reporting simpler and easier to bridge GAAP to non-GAAP reporting. With that, let me now turn the call over to Drew. Drew Del Matto - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Michelle and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I am pleased to say that Fortinet had a very strong first quarter and we outperformed on billings, revenue, gross margin, free cash flow and net income. Our billings for the first quarter were $188 million significantly exceeding our guidance and increasing 26% year-over-year. Total revenue was $169 million, up 24% and also above the high end of our guidance. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margins were 16% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.11 both also well above our guidance. As Michelle mentioned, our non-GAAP EPS was not affected by the change of pro forma items that we are making this quarter, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Non-GAAP gross margins were 71%, which was at the high end of our guided range. Additionally, our cash generation was strong as evidenced by the $50 million of free cash flow, which includes the $20 million Palo Alto networks paid us for a mutual covenant not to sue and release agreement. Finally, during the quarter we repurchased roughly 335,000 shares of our stock returning approximately $7.5 million to shareholders as part of our share repurchase program approved last December. Our strong first quarter results reflect our focused execution, increased investment in sales and marketing and strengthened technology advantage. We continue to gain market share and increase our competitive position. In particular, we are winning a growing number of large enterprise data center security deals with the number of deals over $500,000 in Q1 increasing 146% year-over-year. Similar to what we saw in Q4 of last year, our increased investment in sales and marketing, as well as our ongoing superior innovation and product development, continued to pay off. Increased marketing campaigns and customer adoption of recently announced products helped contribute to our strong quarterly results. We made the strategic decision to invest more for growth and to capitalize on our market opportunity. We believe that these investments are now paying off, with our second quarter of accelerating growth. Let me take a moment to discuss the accounting changes Michelle mentioned in her opening remarks. Effective in Q1, we have changed our policy for calculating non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share to conform to more standard practices and to simplify reporting for investors. The new policy will be used to calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share beginning with our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014. As Michelle stated, we define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, including amortization impairment and other purchase accounting adjustments, and any other significant nonrecurring charges. This change in non-GAAP policy will have the impact of not excluding the patent sale licensing and settlement related income from operating income and diluted net income per share as an adjustment to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. And to reiterate, the changes have no impact on reported revenue or gross margin. Let me now dive deeper into our Q1 results, which can be seen on Slide 3. Billings were $188 million during the first quarter, an increase of $39 million or 26% year-over-year and well above our guided range of $168 million to $173 million. From a geographic perspective, year-over-year billings growth was an impressive 36% in the Americas and 31% in EMEA. APAC billings grew modestly at 6%, in large part due to a tough comparison to last year. We were especially pleased with the continued momentum in the Americas where we expanded our penetration in the large enterprise market, winning numerous data center firewalls and next-generation firewall deployments. We also saw good growth in the mid-sized enterprise market, in large part, the result of our diligent focus on building and enhancing partnerships with large national resellers that serve these markets. Business with national enterprise focused channel partners increased solidly year-over-year. And finally, we experienced a solid performance in our service provider segment and in Latin America, both of which appeared to return to more normal spending patterns than we saw during the first half of last year. With regards to EMEA, we had another quarter of solid execution, as all of the sub-regions executed well, with especially strong performance from Central Europe, the U.K. and the Middle East. We continued to succeed in selling our FortiGate appliances and FortiGuard subscription services to enterprises and service providers, and we also had good traction with our non-FortiGate products especially on FortiWeb Web application firewalls and FortiMail e-mail security appliances. Lastly, regarding APAC, our billings growth rate was impacted by a difficult comparison against the strong Q1 last year. We did, however, see strong performance from Japan, the region\u2019s largest contributor, where we closed some significant deals with large enterprises and service providers. Southeast Asia and China also performed well. Evidence of our success in penetrating large enterprise and service provider markets can be seen in the large number of deals closed during the first quarter. Deals over $100,000 grew 45% to 247 from 170 in the same period last year. Deals over $250,000 grew 42% to 78 compared to 55 last year. And deals over $500,000 grew an impressive 146% to 32 compared to 13 last year. We also had several deals over $1 million, and that number grew year-over-year as well. Our key vertical breakdown across the enterprise remained relatively consistent with service provider at 26%, government at 10%, financial services at 2%, education at 6% and retail at 6%. Now, turning to billings by product segment on Slide 4, we continue to see diversity of product billings across all segments, with high-end FortiGate products, which are typically sold to large enterprises and service providers, accounting for 37% compared to 30% last year; mid-range enterprise products accounting for 25% compared to 32% in Q1 of last year; and entry-level products, which typically are deployed in enterprise branch offices and SMBs, accounting for 38%, the same percentage year-over-year. And as a reminder, our product billings mix varies quarter to quarter based on the composition of products in our deals. I also want to point out that similar to Q4, the percentage mix of entry-level products was slightly skewed at the low end again, primarily due to several large service provider deals where a high number of entry-level products were purchased and deployed at a customer\u2019s site versus as a managed security services delivered via the cloud. With regard to revenue, during the first quarter, total revenue was $168.9 million, up 24% year-over-year and well above our guided range of $155 million to $159 million, driven by strong new product sales in the quarter. As a result, product revenue increased 32% year-over-year. New product sales typically generate recurring revenue through our platform of FortiGuard security subscriptions, reflecting the adhesion of our offering with our customers. On a geographic basis, you can see on Slides 5 and 6 that revenues continue to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. Our strongest year-over-year revenue growth came from the Americas which grew 38% to $72.4 million and now comprises 43% of total revenue. Some key deals in the Americas region included a seven-figure data center security deal with one of North America\u2019s largest telecommunications companies. This company is a large, existing customer using numerous Fortinet products to protect its own infrastructure and deliver an array of managed security services to their customers. During Q1, they purchased several high-end FortiGate-5000 chassis appliances to use as high-performance, low-latency firewalls to support their data center expansion and increase capacity and bandwidth requirements. We also had a seven-figure win during the quarter with a large U.S. federal government agency that required a high-performance data center firewall solution to enable it to securely share services with other government entities. The deal included deploying our high-end FortiGate-5000 products in two data centers as well as our FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer large-scale management and analysis appliances along with professional services. We beat out Palo Alto Networks, CheckPoint, Juniper and Cisco due to our superior performance capability as well as our ability to provide the lowest total cost of ownership. And finally, we won a large enterprise data center firewall deal with one of the biggest software companies in the world. This customer chose our newly-introduced FortiGate 3700D high-end appliances to protect their bandwidth-intensive content delivery network. After extensive testing, we won this deal against CheckPoint based on the unmatched raw performance and price performance our products deliver. Our products are now used to provide next-generation network security to two of the world\u2019s largest software companies, illustrating the strength of our offerings with discerning technology-savvy enterprises. Now, turning to EMEA, revenues were $56.6 million, up 20% compared to $47.3 million last year. Some key deals included a greater than $500,000 deal with a large European government agency which is building out its next generation network to help improve security and connectivity and encourage shared services between government agencies. The deal included numerous Fortinet appliances, Fortinet products, including our new FortiGate-1500D enterprise next-generation firewall appliances, FortiMail e-mail security appliances, FortiAuthenticator-3000D secure authentication appliances, and our FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer management and analysis appliances. We beat Cisco, CheckPoint, and Juniper for this deal based on our ability to meet an array of complex security requirements via our broad platform of network security products. Additionally, we expanded our footprint within a key financial services customer in Europe that ranks among the world\u2019s top banks. In this competitive six-figure deal against CheckPoint, Fortinet\u2019s enterprise high-end FortiGate appliances were selected to protect thousands of the ATM machine transactions. Obviously mission-critical in nature, security effectiveness, reliability and customer responsiveness are critical and served as key factors in why we won this deal. In APAC, revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $39.9 million from $35.9 million last year. Among the key deals in the region was a seven-figure firewall deal, firewall win with a large diversified telecommunications company which required increased security for its virtualized multilayer network. The unmatched performance and carrier class network security features we delivered during testing enabled us to beat out the incumbent, Palo Alto Networks, as well as CheckPoint and F5 Networks for this deal. Turning to Slide 7 and the revenue breakdown by product and services, product revenues increased 32% year-over-year to $76.8 million, driven by larger deals and sales of new products, especially in the enterprise. We saw continued adoption of our recently introduced FortiGate-3700D and FortiGate-1500D high-performance next-generation data center security appliances. The FortiGate-3700D and 1500D utilize our newest FortiASIC network processor 6, or NP6, and lower both capital and operational costs while providing the fastest speed and lowest latency available in their respective categories. Ken will provide more color on these products and specific customer wins in a few minutes. Services and other revenue grew to $92.2 million, or 18% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to consistent growth in our FortiGuard subscription offerings and FortiCare support, both offerings generating strong recurring revenue streams as well as growth in our professional services revenue from large enterprise customers. And annualized support and subscription renewal rates continue to be in the mid-70 percentage range. As a reminder, our renewal rates are in some ways understated because renewals are tied to the specific appliance. So when a customer upgrades their equipment by replacing old appliances with new appliances, the associated purchase support will count as a new deal and not a renewal. With respect to headcount, shown on Slide 8, we ended the first quarter with 2,389 employees, a modest increase over Q4. Our plan is to continue to hire for expected growth, with a focus on expanding sales capacity. Turning to non-GAAP expenses and profitability, during the first quarter, consolidated non-GAAP gross profit margins were 71.1%, at the high end of our guided range. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 58.9%, an increase from last quarter due to the greater mix of high-end products. Non-GAAP services and other gross margins increased slightly to 81.3% from 80.5% during the same period last year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $93.9 million during the first quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $26.3 million, or 16% of total revenue, above our guided range of 12%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $18.2 million or $0.11 per share, based on 168 million diluted shares outstanding and above our guided range of approximately $0.08 per share. The non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 33%. And GAAP net income for the first quarter totaled $8.4 million or $0.05 per share compared to $12.2 million or $0.07 per share in the prior year period. Our reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP financials can be seen on Slides 15 and 16. Now, turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, we ended Q1 with $888 million in cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments, up from $843 million at the end of Q4. Looking at Slide 11, the increase was primarily driven the $61 million in cash generated from operations. This was our 33rd consecutive quarter of generating cash from operations. Free cash flow was $50 million in the first quarter, up $13 million or 36% year-over-year. This includes $20 million that Palo Alto Networks paid Fortinet in a covenant not to sue and release agreement. Inventory turns for Q1 were 2.4, above our goal to manage inventory turns at 2 or better on an annualized basis. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $451 million, up $75 million year-over-year and $19 million sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to consistent renewals and services attached to new product sales. We continue to build an impressive deferred revenue stream, reflecting customer adoption of our suite FortiGuard security services, which generate recurring subscription revenue. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter the company repurchased $7.5 million or approximately 335,000 common shares. As of the end of March, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares or $46.5 million under the $200 million stock repurchase program that we announced in early December of 2013. $153.5 million remains available as of March 31, 2014. I will discuss our guidance in a bit, but first, let me turn the call over to Ken who will provide more color on the overall market, new product introductions and our competitive advantage. Ken Xie - Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Drew. Fortinet\u2019s strong execution during the first quarter helped us significantly overachieve our finance goal and the growth target. In addition to continue to deliver the innovation, we believe that our result and the last two quarters of our accelerated growth show that the investments we have been making are paying off nicely. So anyone who knows Fortinet knows our technology roots are deep. Our mission is to deliver the most innovative, highest performing network security platform to secure and simplify IT infrastructure. So, we believe our product and technology focus is key for long-term success and we are continuing to deliver on this everyday. As Drew mentioned, in Q1 we were pleased to see the high level of customer enthusiasm for the adoption of our new FortiGate-3700D and FortiGate-1500D security appliance, both products were introduced later last year. And they utilized Fortinet\u2019s latest FortiASIC-NP6 processor could deliver significantly higher firewall performance, low power consumption and far better price performance than comparable product on the market. Additionally, the FortiGate-3700D is the first security product to include FortiGate\u2019s Ethernet port interface, which is key in integrating high-speed next generation enterprise on the data center networks. This put Fortinet under the forefront of innovation and widened our competitive advantage considerably. Results are what matters and the customer adoption of the new FortiGate-3700D and 1500D appliances has been impressive. During the first quarter, we closed several large highly competitive enterprise data center deals based on our ability to provide the very best performance, lowest latency, stability and the total cost of ownership. Drew mentioned a FortiGate-1500D deal we won over a Europe government agency. So we also won a number of impressive deals based on our FortiGate-3700D enterprise data center security appliance. So, I feel including a seven-figure win over Juniper, CheckPoint, and F5 with one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies secure several data centers in Asia as a part of the next generation network build-out. We also won a $0.5 million passed deal with a well-known European digital media and music stream company that needed for high-speed security for multiple data centers to support high bandwidth traffic and high volume users. So we beat Juniper here. And finally, as Drew mentioned previously, a large enterprise data center win against CheckPoint with one of the biggest software companies in the world to protect their bandwidth intensive content delivery network. During the later part of first quarter, we also began the shipping of FortiSandbox advanced persistent threat appliance. While still new to the market, customer and partner interest has been high and as the product has proven itself in the real world test. NSS Labs, one of the industry\u2019s most well-respected testing organization recently conducted an industry-first comparative test of APT products. Fortinet\u2019s FortiSandbox-3000D was among the few to receive a recommended rating ranked among the highest in security effectiveness and in delivering the best total cost of ownership. So we beat (indiscernible) and other competitors in this test. There is a lot of marketing noise in the security space, which can make it harder to decipher the best product from the one with the most hype. For this reason, third-party testing and industry certifications are key and sometimes our customers tell us they are truly valuable in their decision-making processes. So, to help customers making clear judgment and purchasing decision, one could argue the security industry should have what is akin to FDA approval in the healthcare context, a regular system and a testing process to certify products can actually do what the vendor claim they can do. Security is a critical technology and that if it is failed to perform as marketed, the outcome could be serious. So, unbiased third-party tests like NSS are the closest thing to this as it is the only time the public can see the result of the computing products testing against each other under the real world conditions. What we have setup in our marketing activities in whole Fortinet is a technology focused company and our products sell, because of technology superiority, not because of the hype. So, this is proven by the fact that Fortinet has most third-party certifications than any other security vendors. You can see all this on Slide 12. When we get into a deal, our products are tested alongside competitors. We most often win and our customers recommend our product to others everyday, which is something we are very proud of. During the quarter, we also increased our offering on apps and web services with the addition of our flagship FortiGate virtualized security appliance. Our FortiManager-VM and FortiAnalyzer-VM are also already available on AWS enabling customers to deploy security management and reporting to FortiGate and FortiGate-VM products running and of age in the internal networks and at the remote office within the coded center are deployed in the cloud. Finally, on the new product front, as Drew mentioned, we are also seeing traction in the sales of our complementary FortiGate products, like our FortiWeb application firewall, the FortiMail e-mail security appliance and FortiAP secure access wireless appliance. While still minority of our total revenue today these products expand our growth opportunity and total addressable market, which IDC forecasts to be $13 billion in 2017. As I look ahead, I am confident about the future. We plan to continue to invest in responsibly and given our market opportunity as we remain optimistic about our ability to maintain momentum in 2014 driven by a number of factors that bode well with Fortinet. First, the growing APT opportunity and the requirement of our extended next generation firewall deeper and broader to including deep flow anti-malware and integrate sandbox into combat the most sophisticated threat. Our FortiSandbox appliance has been sure to be technically superior in the effectiveness and far more competitive total cost ownership to most APT products and our market-leading FortiGate next-gen firewall appliance has receiving numerous specification and award and secured the majority of a global Fortune 500 company today. Second, the enterprise and service providers are beginning to build out their next-generation data center networks, which will leverage the 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit interface to deliver terabyte of performance. Fortinet is the only security vendor that can deliver upon this network and security performance requirement today. And finally, the cloud and mobile security opportunity in front of us, which required the need to protect and access internet ability device and applications in wired, wireless and a virtual environment. As you can see on Slide 13, Fortinet offer virtualized product to support all major VM platforms, including VMware, Citrix, Amazon, Microsoft and RedHat. Now, let me turn the call back to Drew who will discuss our forward finance guidance. Drew Del Matto - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Ken. I want to finish with our financial outlook for the second quarter, as well as provide some directional guidance for the full year 2014. Although we may choose to revisit how we give guidance in the future, at this time we are comfortable with the approach we are taking. Before reviewing guidance, however, let me remind you that our guidance consists of forward-looking statements, and please keep in mind Michelle\u2019s earlier comments regarding such statements. Looking back at our results over the last few quarters, it\u2019s clear that Fortinet has been executing well. The network security market is healthy and dynamic. Increased high-profile cyber attacks keep network security at the top of customers\u2019 minds along with the compelling technology market drivers Ken just mentioned, such as advanced persistent threats, next-generation high-performance networks and cloud and virtualized environments. Fortinet\u2019s broad platform of innovative and certified network security products and our clear performance advantage position us well to continue to grow and gain share. As I stated earlier, for this reason, we have been investing responsibly and deliberately for growth, and these investments are paying off. We intend to continue this strategy with an ongoing focus on building self-capacity and self-enablement along with increased marketing and a continued commitment to technology innovation. We believe it is the right thing for our business and that it will yield returns over the long term. With that as background, let me now provide specific guidance metrics for the second quarter of 2014, which can be seen on Slide 14. We expect billings to be in the range of $185 million to $190 million, up approximately 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. Total revenues is expected to be in the range of $169 million to $172 million, up approximately 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% to 71%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 13% to 14%, reflecting the continued growth investments I just mentioned. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.10 per share based on an expected diluted share account in the range of 168 million to 170 million shares. In terms of 2014, we have seen the continuation of improvements in the overall network security spending environment that began in Q4. This combined with the return on investments that we\u2019re beginning to see and will continue to make in sales and marketing, our ongoing focus on execution and technology and performance leadership give us confidence in a slightly more positive view on top line growth. Though we are currently maintaining our full year directional guidance range of billings growth of at least two times that of the network security market, we feel confident that we can perform at the high end of the range or better. Analysts currently forecast the market growth rate as 6% to 7%, which would take us up to the 14% growth or higher range. We believe this represents a reasonable growth outlook. It is still early in the year. As we gain more visibility on the full year, we will make adjustments, if appropriate, at the right time. In regards to the bottom line, we still expect to deliver annual operating margins of approximately 17%, plus or minus a point due to fluctuations in the business, investment activities and top line results. In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to express my enthusiasm for the future at Fortinet and to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that, Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator, can you please start the Q&A? Operator : (Operator Instructions) So we will take our first question from Brent J. Thill from UBS. One moment, Brent, while we open your line. Your line is open. Brent J. Thill - UBS: Great. Good afternoon. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, Andrew, just when you talked about the growth rate and deals more than $500,000, that\u2019s a pretty drastic change considering a seasonally softer Q1. Can you maybe just give us a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing? I know you mentioned telco was strong, but can you also mention other segments that helped drive that and how sustainable you think that is as you look at your pipeline going into Q2 on the large deal front? Drew Del Matto : Yes. Thanks, Brent. I would say that there is quite honestly I don\u2019t have a lot more color to add. I think we feel very good about what we saw on the enterprise. That\u2019s where we see the bulk of the big, the larger deals. I think we mentioned last quarter that people were asking how would we see, how would get credibility and traction in the enterprise, so I think we pointed out that we would hopefully see a positive trend and the larger deal size growing, and I think that\u2019s what we saw. As far as the funnel goes looking forward that would tend to be what we see right now as well, it\u2019s early in the quarter, and one of the things we\u2019re seeing is just that simply the deal profile changes in a way such that I think it gets a little harder to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen in a given quarter. You end up with kind of a bigger funnel, but a little more hit-miss on the deals as they grow larger in size which would be typical of any more enterprise-focused company. Ken Xie : Yes, Brent. Also, remember one year ago, we mentioned we started building more dedicated teams for the enterprise and vertical space. I think that\u2019s the benefit or result of the effort we put in there. Now because this dedicated team, they tend to focus on bigger deals, and that\u2019s probably what ends up as a more larger deal we are closing right now. Brent J. Thill - UBS: Okay, thank you. Drew Del Matto : Yes. The other thing I would point out is we sold very good traction on the 3700D and the 1500D, which again, are enterprise and 3700D especially in data center. Brent J. Thill - UBS: Terrific. Thanks. Operator : Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley : Hi. This is Melissa Gorham. I am calling in for Keith. Thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. I just have a question for Andrew. On the service provider business, you saw a really nice rebound in Q1. Moving forward into 2014, should we assume this level of growth is going to sustain or is there any sort of one-time impacts in there that contributed to the strong growth in Q1? Drew Del Matto : Thanks, Melissa. First of all, so we are not really giving guidance beyond what we just said, kind of the 2x north of the benchmarks we shared, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a big change. I think there\u2019s nothing we see specifically that would change it one way or the other. Michelle Spolver : Yes. And actually, Melissa, this is Michelle. So let me actually add on that, too. If you remember back in Q1 of 2013, service provider was one of the areas that was weak for us and across for many companies during that time, so that\u2019s why you\u2019d see a bigger impact year-over-year in the service provider business. We talked about the end of Q4, seeing a bit of a rebound and going to more normalized spending patterns, we saw continuation of that in Q1. Ken Xie : Also we see a lot of service providers they are testing the 4G LTE, especially the Tier 1. They accelerated the testing. And Tier 2, Tier 3 are starting to have some deployment, but not in Tier 1 yet. So that is a service provider that you may see get probably more normal compared to one year ago, but you still will not see, like the big acceleration of the 4G LTE is not significant yet. Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. And then just one follow-up on investments for 2014, and specifically related to sales hiring. Can you maybe just provide some more color in terms of where you are in terms of sales capacity and how we should thinking maybe about head count ramping throughout the remainder of the year? I know that the head count ads have been growing pretty nicely, but it did decelerate a bit in Q1, so just wondering how to think about it for the remainder of 2014? Drew Del Matto : Well, yes. I think we have given you one, from a modeling perspective, I think we\u2019ve given you kind of how we\u2019re thinking about the broader top line growth with 2x the benchmark or better and then I believe we gave some operating margin guidance as well. So we\u2019re trying to live within that framework for now. In terms of the investments, what we\u2019re seeing as we add head count, they tend to pay off two or three quarters later. We\u2019ve seen that consistently for the last couple of quarters. And so we\u2019re trying to basically continue to build that momentum. We see a lot of opportunity, and we literally saw a benchmark, or, excuse me, a comment from Gartner where they forecast 75% of all enterprises will buy network security from a vendor other than their network infrastructure provider. And so, we see a variety of opportunities like that in the enterprise and just in specific geographic areas and we\u2019re targeting those areas for investments, and we hope that they pay off six to nine months later. Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley : Okay, that makes sense. Thank you very much. Drew Del Matto : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to drill into looking at the mix of products, the mid-range and the high-end, so the high-end was a number of percentage points higher. Mid-range, I think, was down year-over-year. Is that a reflection of where you\u2019re allocating those investments in sales and marketing? Is it representative of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace or something else? Ken Xie : I think the two new products, the 1500D and 3700D helping accelerate some of the high-end and then \u2013 because they\u2019re using the new NP6, and then the industry will start building to the other high-end also the middle-range products. I think that probably will be later this year, helping on the middle-range and the other high-end product. Also, it\u2019s kind of some contribution from the dedicated team. When the deals got bigger, they do, including the high-end box, but also a lot of time they also include a lot of smaller boxes, especially like the retail space, and some others like, they call it the CPE space or service provider space, so they\u2019re including both ends. So that\u2019s where the high-end box and also the small CPE box also kind of has a good increase. But once we have the NP6 starting out in the middle-range, we believe that will also help in grow the middle range. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: That makes sense. Michelle Spolver : Yes, Sterling, actually, if I can add to that, too, which Drew talked about in this commentary, that in Q1 in particular, we had a few service provider deals where they were CPE-based deployments and included a lot of low-end boxes which therefore made that number, made the entry-level category a bit higher than it would have been otherwise. And to answer the first part of the question, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a direct reflection of where our investments are. We have been focusing our investments, especially on the marketing side, in the enterprise, and so I think that\u2019s showing the payoff there with that category getting larger. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Okay. And then one follow-up question. I get asked often \u2013 you mentioned the virtual appliances that are available in the AWS marketplace as an example. One of the questions that I often get is, are you allowing customers to utilize their existing licenses on those virtual appliances, meaning moving them over, similar to like what a Barracuda might do, and really what people are trying to get to is, when you think about that virtual opportunity, how incremental do you think that market and growth will be versus just kind of transitioning stuff from on premise to the cloud and not really generating much incremental revenue? Ken Xie : I think first the virtual market, especially now with security is still relatively very small. So the common numbers early by 2017, less than 10% of network security will be on a virtualized platform. But with that said, also virtualized in some data centers, if they already have some existing servers, they may leverage the server\u2019s computing power to deploy the virtualized appliance compared to you putting in the dedicated power. Dedicate power is still much higher performance like, way faster, like 10x faster than the virtualized because all the acceleration we have on the FortiASIC or other things. I think that\u2019s, we see that space is complementary to some of the real appliance, and especially some data centers, they have actual computing power, they may using some virtualized, and also some other sort of application, like the one we work closely with, Amazon, they also expanded quickly in their current resolution, because they have a huge server farm they may leverage that like a platform to do some virtualization. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Jonathan, please go ahead. Jonathan Ho - William Blair : Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to start out with, from a geographic perspective, if we could get a little bit more detail on your thoughts around APAC. I know you guys said that it was a tough comparison, but just wanted to see where you see an opportunity to essentially improve those results throughout the course of the year and maybe some color in terms of actions that you are taking? Ken Xie : I think we do see potential APAC as a high growth area. We are just trying accelerate some of the investments, especially the sales capacity in APAC, which we kind of grow relatively slow compared with the top line in the last few quarters. But also, like Drew said, there\u2019s a tough comparison compared to one year ago, and but we do see in the other major countries there, it\u2019s a pretty nice growth. Drew Del Matto : Yes, I would echo Ken\u2019s sentiment. It\u2019s something to point out because when we look at our model and how we\u2019re ramping we could see actually that we had \u2013 we made a couple organizational changes there over the last couple of quarters, one. And then I think the hiring kind of flattened out mid-last year. And we\u2019re hoping \u2013 and if we look at the other geos we were investing more, relatively more, and we saw relative more pay off in the last couple of quarters. And so they actually illustrate the opportunity to grow. Ken Xie : Yes, the other thing also, in APAC we\u2019re also starting more focus on some dedicated verticals and also some enterprise carriers. So you can see that the bigger deals we win I mentioned in earning calls conference the APAC, which is like a seven-digit deal has not happened a lot in the past. So we started to see more opportunities for the bigger deals, right now in APAC. Drew Del Matto : Yes, that\u2019s right. And they also had a pretty strong Q1 last year as well. I think it grew 25% in Q1 2013 versus the prior-year. Jonathan Ho - William Blair : Got it. And just in terms of the non-FortiGate products, you guys highlighted that, that\u2019s sort of an increasing growth opportunity for you guys. You\u2019re seeing sort of more interest in it. Is this one of the contributors for larger deals? And should we be looking at this as maybe a potential second set of drivers? Is it more sort of for 2014, more for 2015? And just how, can you give us maybe a sense of how fast these non-FortiGate products are growing year-over-year? Even if they\u2019re not large today just some additional color would definitely be helpful. Thank you. Ken Xie : I think we are still \u2013 the number is still relatively small. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t quite break it out. But I can say we have a very good technology we call the non-FortiGate or FortiGate complementary like the FortiWeb, the FortiMail, FortiSandbox, the FortiDDoS. So all this product you can see from all the testing, all the certification, we are ahead of our competitors in that space, which they only do some dedicated. I mean they only sell in that particular narrow-focus space, compared to we have much broader solutions. The other thing really we call the FortiGate complementary because these products are also working well with FortiGate. So once the FortiGate is starting to deploy sometimes the Web server, the e-mail server, DDos for the data center, the Sandbox and also can working with firewall. So that\u2019s where we also see some opportunity to upsell and to broaden this market space. I think it\u2019s \u2013 maybe, Drew, you want to add some detailed numbers? Drew Del Matto : Yes, no, probably not get into numbers, but I mean, I think the way you should think about it is it\u2019s just something that could be included with the FortiGate broad platform deals, where we have broader platform deals. Quite honestly, they\u2019re not huge numbers yet, but they are growing year-over-year very nicely. So I think it \u2013 I mean, in terms of big, large numbers, you\u2019re probably looking more over the long term than \u2013 look it\u2019ll help in 2014, but it\u2019ll help more longer term. Jonathan Ho - William Blair : Great, thank you. Ken Xie : And then also, most importantly, all the internally developed leverage our firewall technology and also more broad IP patents. Operator : Okay, thank you. And we will take our next question from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo : Great, thanks a lot. Just had a couple questions, if I can. So you highlighted on the call that Fortinet scored very well on the recent NSS Labs test for advanced malware detection. How has that impacted new customer interest in your new Sandbox appliance item? And I know it\u2019s only been a few weeks since the test came out. And then when should we think about that product gaining traction and becoming material to billings? Ken Xie : I think first, the impact on the particular product, FortiSandbox, is relatively small because we only announced like, probably like a few weeks, at the end of the quarter. But we\u2019ve proven we have very strong technology, especially now the Sandbox, but also the FortiGuard, the global service and security intelligence service. So that\u2019s part of the result because we have very broad and very deep security intelligence supporting service globally. And that\u2019s also not only benefiting the Sandbox, but also the FortiGate, the FortiDDoS, the FortiWeb, and also the other products we have. The other part really we do see the APT key starting to become kind of a, quite a topic for larger enterprise and larger, like, Internet service providers. So we see that\u2019s one of the three driving forces I mentioned as not only the APT, but also the upgrade for the 40-gig to 100-gig and also the cloud/mobile solutions. It\u2019s one of the three driving force to driving the market today. So we\u2019re positioned well, and also we\u2019ve been involved in the technology for many, many years and we can quickly respond to what the market needs. And then also, the advantage we have, also we can also gradually start including all this technology into the chip, which can accelerate the performance like 10x compared to some software solutions. And software, especially software when they have multiple functions enabled in the PC or server kind of software-based platform compared with we have both the best CPU and also the best ASIC, which are doing quite well with this multi-function device. That\u2019s when we see the benefit of the platform to helping the solution of customers. Drew Del Matto : Yes. And then, Gray, it\u2019s true. And I would say in general the recent test results that we published from NSS did generate some buzz. I think quite a lot of buzz within the network security community for sure. But also in general, we drove some campaigns out there to kind of get people NSS-aware and I think buyers are starting to become more conscious about those results. We had some inbound, let\u2019s say, pull. We\u2019re actually, if you think of sales being more push \u2013 salespeople knocking on doors or inside sales dialing up or even campaign driven; we\u2019ve actually had some pull, in other words, customers referencing results and saying hey, I was researching the space. We\u2019re in a network security upgrade mode and we\u2019re looking to put in new network security and I saw the results and I saw that you were recommended relative to another thing we were looking at that wasn\u2019t, and/or something we might have been looking at also that was. And we\u2019d like to talk to you and hear more about your products and offerings. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for and hopefully we can get more awareness out there through the testing and also through campaigns. Ken Xie : Yes. I think I mentioned it in my script, actually. We see the testing certifications are very important because most of our customers, especially enterprise customers, they don\u2019t have the capability or don\u2019t have the environment to do all this testing, so that\u2019s where throughout these few years we\u2019ve spent a tremendous effort to make sure we\u2019re the best in the third-party evaluation testing and focus a lot on the testing. So that\u2019s where in the slides, you can see we have more certification testing than any other vendor in the space. So that\u2019s just one of the results of our effort to focus on the testing technology we have. Drew Del Matto : And that\u2019s a solid message for us to utilize in our campaigns. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo : Got it, okay. And then you kind of touched on my next question. I just was kind of thinking of those test results as almost free marketing, and you said it\u2019s kind of helping you get your foot in the door with customers. In terms of the customers that are looking to test your FortiSandbox solution, is there a particular vertical where you feel like you\u2019re having the most inbound calls? You kind of said enterprise broadly. Is it like technology or healthcare or financial services, just any particular customer set that\u2019s looking at you? Michelle Spolver : I think at this point it\u2019s too \u2013 the products have only been available for a couple of weeks so I think right now it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s across the enterprise, not \u2013 we can\u2019t get more specific in terms of exactly which verticals are requesting them more. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo : Got it. Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Ives from FBR. Please go ahead, Daniel. Daniel Ives - FBR: Thanks. Great quarter. So, Ken, what\u2019s sort of your view, I mean, obviously a lot of company-specific success, execution products but from a secular perspective, I mean, maybe just talk about security, where you\u2019re seeing it today in terms of budgets, deal flow, overall in terms of interest maybe relative to where we\u2019ve seen over the last year or two. I mean, obviously you guys are benefiting kind of \u2013 I\u2019m just be interested from a secular perspective how you\u2019re viewing security relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years? Ken Xie : I think probably like I mentioned the infrastructure upgrade that\u2019s happened every like four or five years. And we starting to see the cycle started again compared to like 2009, 2010, which was after the (indiscernible). Now we see the data center, big enterprise starting to see the 40-gig to the 100-gig. So that\u2019s what\u2019s helping drive the \u2013 because network security is a part of infrastructure. If you have a faster like a switch and all those kind of things in enterprise data center, you do need the faster secure gateway. So that\u2019s why we see the high-speed interface like the 40-gig or the 100-gig is very critical, very important. So you need to have a solution in order to participate in this kind of RFP. The other part I have to say in the last like 6 to 12 months there are some \u2013 I think some kind of hype about APT and also a lot of news that also drive a lot of interest sometime, not only in IT but also go to the company and management, even the board level, to see the important of security. We also try to leverage that one. The other part is especially we try to build some dedicated team to target some big enterprise and also some of the we call distributed enterprise, more like retail kind of thing. And the other part I mentioned in the last few quarters, probably we starting see more testing going on, but not quite a result and a lot of business yet. It\u2019s really the 4G LTE audit (indiscernible) the traditional server client called the mobile space, especially a lot of mobile device. They have to have a lot of important data to secure, and the cloud also causing a lot of important applications, a lot of data there. So that\u2019s why see the interest from service providers for the 4G LTE we see kind of accelerated testing and evaluation in the space. But it\u2019s still more in early stage and not see a lot of result yet. But we do believe this will be also huge growth opportunity but it\u2019s still in very, very early stage. Daniel Ives - FBR: And just as a follow up, do you sense that Fortinet is getting invited more in terms of like seven-figure deals from these larger deals and maybe before you should have built-out the product there, and maybe some of the channel that you were not getting invited in terms from these multi-million dollar deals? Ken Xie : We do. One thing it\u2019s because we see that especially once we have the new technology, NP6. Now we have a much faster and a lot of times the only solution on the market is that high-speed and the low-latency solution. So we started to get more invited. We also started increasing some sales capacity, because we feel that we\u2019re still much more efficient than some of the high-growth network security companies. You can look at the percentage for every dollar sales we spend and compare to some of the other high growth network security companies we are still much more efficient. So that\u2019s where we changed the strategy almost one years ago, try to invest more into the sales and marketing capacity. We can see some good results come out in the last two quarters. I think that we believe that there\u2019s a huge opportunity in the market, and gaining market share is still kind of more valuable. So we\u2019re contending to invest in this area. Daniel Ives - FBR: Got it. Okay, thanks. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz from Jefferies. Aaron, please go ahead. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. When I look at the results here, you had a material upside on the product revenue side, and it seemed like a little bit less so on the deferred side. So the product revenue really provided the bulk of the billing side performance. Is that a function of the strong telco performance we talked about here in the quarter, and that your telco customers maybe tend to buy firewall-only solutions more so than your enterprise customers? Could you walk through the dynamic there? Drew Del Matto : Aaron, it\u2019s true. Maybe I could clarify the question a bit. Are you asking about the strength of the product revenue? Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: I am just asking what the \u2013 yes, in a degree. But I would have expected deferred just to see similar strength and it \u2013 all the numbers were obviously strong here, it seemed like the outperformance was really on a product side. So is that just a function of the mix more towards service provider in the large deals that you talked to where you tend to see just more firewall only deals there and just a lower attach of the other services? Ken Xie : So I think clearly, the product is the leading indicator because if you\u2019ve got a product coming first, and then certainly able to service during the deployment. One service sometimes they call that bundled service. Service usually come after the product. So we do see \u2013 happy to see the product. Especially we mentioned a new product, we see some good acceleration, the 1500D and 3700D we see it quite nicely ramp up. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Right. I guess I thought with the bundle if you\u2019d still book the deferred at the time of shipment. And so I\u2019m just wondering on the new products you called out if those are more likely firewall-only sales? Ken Xie : Probably not, I think it\u2019s a lot of firewall we later converted into \u2013 add additional service. Like we said, we probably averaged about 80% of product they deploy will be on the firewall function, the firewall only probably only account on about 20% or less. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Okay. Maybe just a quick other question, probably for Drew here, but on the $20 million you called out on the cash flow, was that purely a cash flow event or was anything taken through the income statement? Thanks. Drew Del Matto : You are talking on the pan? Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Yes. Drew Del Matto : No. We are amortizing that over six years. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Okay, so is that straight line so we can just do the math to... Drew Del Matto : Yes, and it started in February, so you wouldn\u2019t get a full quarter in Q1. I think it was \u2013 yes, February. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Okay. And is that on the product or the services line? Drew Del Matto : It\u2019s actually contra expense. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Oh, it\u2019s a contra expense? Drew Del Matto : Yes. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from David Kaplan from Barclays. David, please go ahead. David Kaplan - Barclays: Hi, evening everybody. Most of the questions have already been asked, but if we can touch a little bit, you guys focused a lot on the fact that the large deals are coming from upgrade cycles on the infrastructure. Do you think we are still at the beginning of that cycle or have we worked our way through it to some extent? That\u2019s the first question. And then the second question, you guys also mentioned specifically your web application firewalls. So traditionally, we have talked about comparing in-line security for enterprise, and are you seeing the same kind of preference from customers in the data centers or, in data centers also, for an in-line sales single vendor providing a number of solutions? Or is there a little bit more flexibility in those data centers? Ken Xie : Yes, this kind \u2013 I think probably if you see the new infrastructure upgrade, especially the 40-gig to 100-gig is still in very, very early stage, so it\u2019s, because it\u2019s just in the beginning of the fresh upgrade, you can also see some of the numbers from some other networking solutions vendors, but since ramped up nicely there. As you mentioned, talking about whether the prevention or detection, we more favored the prevention deployment is, whether the FortiGate or some other, like a DDoS or other product, if you let us know when and we\u2019re already helping the IT guy to really combat all the threats there, the detection mode is whether, like ten years ago, the intrusion detection compared to intrusion prevention. Today it\u2019s more like a malware APT. We feel it\u2019s more difficult for the IT guy to really quickly react and it sometimes becomes a big burden for them like the big news, the end of last year in the retail when this is really \u2013 they detect like thousands of intrusions every day and it\u2019s very difficult to do anything about it. So that\u2019s where the big solution you have would be the in line prevention solution which can automatically act, react to all these kinds of attack. And at the same time if there is some actual project that we also maybe sometimes could be multiple layer solutions, especially on the malware side and also what can a service provider carrier. We see some carriers starting offer what they call the clean pipe solution, which is also additional protection come from the infrastructure is also another benefit instead of a low out of burden to some enterprise and to the customer. So that\u2019s where we see the combination with the infrastructure carrier service provider and also we call the security service provider, (indiscernible) and also enterprise themselves, this multiple layer to protect all their tech from malware side, especially the in line devices is really the one can really provide a value compared to just reporting all kind of a detection, which can make a very good noise, very good hype but it\u2019s really going to solve their problem. David Kaplan - Barclays: Great, thanks. Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from Jayson Nolan from Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : Great, thank you. A couple clarifications first, 3700D and the 1500D are classified as high and low end or mid range? Ken Xie : It\u2019s a high end. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : Because of the NP6? Ken Xie : Because I think because of what we call it a parcel because the category (indiscernible) than like one or two-year. Two-year and above is at the high end recommend. And then the one-year tend to be middle range then the next part to be the low end. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : And the 5000 series has yet to be released with the NP6, is that right? Ken Xie : Yes. Yes. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : And that would be a high-end chassis also? Ken Xie : Yes, that\u2019s right. Michelle Spolver : The 5000 is a high-end chassis. The other two are appliances. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : Right, okay. My question, probably for Drew, if you could talk a little bit about sales and marketing spend, how those dollars are being deployed sales versus marketing? And how you\u2019re measuring the performance of that in the field? Drew Del Matto : Right. So I assume you are talking about going forward, Jayson? Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : That\u2019s right. Drew Del Matto : Yes. I think we are still investing in marketing. We still need \u2013 and I think of marketing as being more kind of sales enablement and it goes back to very consistent method with what we were saying last quarter about it\u2019s time \u2013 we are driving campaigns. And if you take the NSS test results as an example, you drive campaigns off that. You serve people ads. Hopefully they\u2019re going to click and you\u2019ll lead billings, you\u2019ll lead, excuse me, generate leads off of that, that the sales people then get developed in the field or inside sales and it gets hopefully turned into a billing at some point. And so that\u2019s very much where we\u2019re focused right now. That\u2019s the type of marketing activity we\u2019re focused on. So the other part of sales enablement would be process orientation so as we get to current and new people on board, we\u2019re very much focused on them measuring their funnel and measuring their progress with the funnel through to closure. And we\u2019ve been doing that for a while I would just say I think the discipline and the hygiene around that\u2019s getting better. There\u2019s still a bit of investment just kind of getting people trained to do it consistently so that we can predict the business with more clarity, kind of have better insight into the business by deal size and just overall what we think\u2019s going to close in a given period. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : Okay, great. Drew Del Matto : Yes, okay. Other than that I\u2019d say sales capacity. We\u2019re also, we see, we believe there\u2019s opportunity for sales capacity. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : Headcount. Drew Del Matto : Yes, headcount. We need more feet on the street and yes, just make sure we have the right coverage model and we\u2019re covering off all the accounts we can. We see a lot of opportunity. Ken Xie : Yes, there is quite some vertical space. We don\u2019t have enough coverage yet. So we will continue to invest in that vertical space. Jayson Nolan - Robert Baird : Thanks, guys. Operator : Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer: Thank you. Hi, good afternoon. Great quarter, guys. Two quick questions on my end; I want to go back to some of the commentary you made on your performance specifically in Japan. Drew, Ken, what\u2019s behind it? Are you been displacing some of your bigger competitors within Japan specifically? Ken Xie : I think we changed a little bit strategy in Japan because we in like in the last few quarters we started building some dedicated teams to target some big service provider carrier enterprise. So we see that part starting to pay off right now. And on other side is also we have pretty strong local team, which also kind of do a lot of supporting locally. And also we have a lot of long-term partner starting to see the value, the benefit we deliver on the product technology. So they are starting to helping on the growth. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer: Got it. Got it. And as you guys continue to increase your head count U.S., EMEA, what companies specifically are you hiring from? Is it diverse? Is there any major difference between the R&D hiring and the service marketing hiring in terms of the company that you\u2019re able to draw talent from? Drew Del Matto : Look, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think it would be to anyone\u2019s benefit to mention specific companies that we\u2019re targeting for hire. But I would just say look, we\u2019re looking for experienced people who are capable of selling our product. I think we have a very compelling product line and a very compelling message and a very compelling market. And we\u2019re just looking for people who are very motivated and want to win in the space and make decent money along the way. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer: Good job. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Fish - Citi: Hi, guys. This is actually Jim Fish on for Walter. So you guys have kind of talked about that this year is mainly an investment year for sales and marketing. As you look out beyond fiscal year 2014, how are you thinking about margins and your desire to drive some margin expansion versus say investing back in the business? Drew Del Matto : Yes. Jim, we are not giving long-term guidance beyond what we\u2019ve mentioned. So for the year, we\u2019re saying we believe we can grow at 2x or better than market, market being 6% to 7% per IDC and Gartner and then within the margin framework we outlined in the call. Ken Xie : Yes, I think we, like I said in my script we say we invest responsibly and stably. And we are in much, much better position compared to some companies all growth and not profit, as some companies all profit and not growth. So we can kind of nicely go balance or justify our self because of the position we are. We do believe right now the market more values the growth, so that\u2019s where we move towards the gross investment right now. Drew Del Matto : Yes, I mean, but obviously, we\u2019re going to be smart about what we\u2019re doing. I think it\u2019s really a function of can we continue to see the results we\u2019re seeing, are the investments paying off, can we continue to see the opportunity. But right now, we view ourselves as opportunistic. We believe that we\u2019re probably short on the people we need, the feet on the street and the marketing that we need to grow at the level we believe we can grow at. And so I think as we said in the guidance, as we have more information, we\u2019ll update you more at that time. Jim Fish - Citi: Okay, great. Thanks. Just one more is about this $20 million from Palo. Why\u2019d you go at it this way as opposed to taking another strategic route besides using this, I guess as well as the typical question of what\u2019s the capital strategy going forward with having almost \u2013 just under $1 billion here in cash and equivalents? Drew Del Matto : So you want me to take \u2013 it\u2019s two different questions. I\u2019d be glad to take the last part of it first. So obviously on \u2013 in terms of capital strategy, there\u2019s no change from prior quarter. We continue to look to invest in the businesses we just talked about, increasing the sales and marketing investment. We don\u2019t see anything huge M&A-wise, but obviously there could be some sensible inorganic activity at some point. Again nothing \u2013 there\u2019s nothing specifically there we would call out or even are targeting at this point in time. In terms of buybacks, I guess that would be the third part of that, we\u2019ll continue the same guidance we talked about last quarter. We\u2019ll be opportunistic and when the share price looks attractive to us and we believe it\u2019s a good investment we\u2019ll be in the market. Ken Xie : Yes, I can try to answer the first question. I think, first, this is one of the good recognition of Fortinet long-term innovation and also a pioneer in the space and like we started the company 14 years ago and view that the first multi-function device that with platform leverage both the hardware, software and also the service model. And on the other side I think it\u2019s, I myself as more engineer, I think sometimes we \u2013 even competition spends some more money like to recognize all the long-term IP, all the innovation we have compared to spend lot on the quarter on the legal fees. That\u2019s maybe a better use of the money. So that\u2019s probably \u2013 we feel this is the better way to resolve some of the disagreement. On the other side we will continue to keeping invest and also keeping innovating. And like I mentioned that the Fortinet, the vision, we want to be the most innovative and the highest performance IT security with our simplified IT solution. So we\u2019ll continue to go through that path. And also like end of Q1 we had like 159 issued patents. We have other, over 100 pending. So we will continue to innovate and also continue to deliver the best that \u2013 the products in the space. So I think that that\u2019s just to reflect of the whole company culture, the whole strategy we have long term for the company. Jim Fish - Citi: Okay. Great color, guys. Thanks. Drew Del Matto : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turitz from Raymond James. James Wesman - Raymond James : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. It\u2019s James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Question for Drew and Ken. You mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the work you\u2019re doing with large resellers in the Americas. Could you give us some more color on what you\u2019re doing with them and was that where some of the big deals came in the quarter? Michelle Spolver : Actually, I can take it, James. So the type of resellers we\u2019re talking about are for the larger national focused resellers that focus on midrange enterprises we\u2019ll say that they\u2019re not usually going to be the very, very high end service providers of very, very large enterprises. Those are like a FishNet or that type of reseller. So what we\u2019ve done is really expand the partnership we had in place with those type of national resellers. Do a little bit more in the way of programs support, personnel support on that, things like that just to really strengthen and grow the relationship. So it\u2019s not anything significantly different because we have those partnerships in place. I think what we\u2019ve done is putting some more focus and more investment behind those partnerships. James Wesman - Raymond James : Yes. Michelle Spolver : I guess the other thing that contribute to the seven figure deals \u2013 I don\u2019t believe the ones we have talked about on this call \u2013 typically they would be more in the mid-range enterprise space. James Wesman - Raymond James : Okay, that makes sense. And then I\u2019ve got a higher level question for the company as a whole. Do you have any thoughts of moving from network security into end point? Some or your competitors have acquired in these end-to-end point space so I was wondering how that relates to Fortinet \u2013 if you guys have thought about doing that? Ken Xie : I think \u2013 I believe it\u2019s kind of two different markets that need two different approach, and so far you\u2019ll see \u2013 I\u2019ve been in this space for more than 20 years. It\u2019s a \u2013 we address two different kind of issue and so we still believe focus on network security is a key \u2013 it\u2019s a better solution. Drew Del Matto : Yes. And I would just add that and I have a little bit experience on both sides \u2013 just that \u2013 this is Drew \u2013 that there\u2019s also two different buyers. Very often of both of those products and I think when you think about investing responsibly it\u2019s almost like you need a separate sales force to go sell that. So that\u2019s something that would be a \u2013 certainly a headwind when you think about that equation. James Wesman - Raymond James : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Breza from Sterne. Please go ahead. Robert Breza - Sterne: Hi, thanks. Just two quick clarification questions. Drew, you talked about headcount and the investments you\u2019re making on sales and marketing side. Should we just expect head count to track more towards the revenue growth rate? And then as clarification maybe \u2013 you talked about your large deal pipeline, it was up very significantly. Wanting to compare contrast the large deal pipeline maybe from a year ago or as you think about it going into next quarter. Is it up substantially or just as you think about your guidance I\u2019m sure you\u2019re looking at your pipeline with those large deals. So any color would be great? Drew Del Matto : Yes. I mean it\u2019s up clearly at some point the headcount growth should scale with the revenue line. I think near term, they may fall out of balance from time to time, and there\u2019s a little bit of \u2013 it\u2019s a challenging question because it doesn\u2019t exactly work like that. There\u2019s some quarters you may hire faster or slower, you also may have some turnover for a variety of reasons, so it never quite exactly works out like that, but I think as you build out models you do two things. One you try to build capacity to drive your certain head count growth, so they do try to scale over the longer term, and then you try at some point try to \u2013 not that we\u2019re giving long term guidance, I\u2019m just talking theoretically, you know at some point you would try to drive some efficiency in that model as well. So the people are more productive over time. Michelle Spolver : Yes. And I think on this second part of the question on the large deal was that last year at this time for the year-over-year comparison, in Q2 of 2013 we talked about having fewer large deals than we would have typically seen, so to be fair, obviously our growth was very impressive in terms of large deals, but it\u2019s also coming off of a quarter year-over-year, the prior that was weaker on large deals. And then we can\u2019t give too much color really at all about the large deal we have on track for Q2. We don\u2019t really talk about sort of the pipeline, but I would say take that into account that in Q1 we did have an easier comp year-over-year in Q1 of last year. Robert Breza - Sterne: Thanks. Nice quarter. Michelle Spolver : Yes. Drew Del Matto : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sanjit Singh from Wedbush. Sir, please go ahead. Sanjit Singh - Wedbush: Congrats, Ken and Andrew, on a nice quarter. My question is regarding Q1, what do we see in terms of linearity with that in line with historical quarters, or was it \u2013 did it skew a little better? Drew Del Matto : Good question. You know it actually skewed a little better, and you could probably see that a little bit in DSL actually, the receivable balance. So it skews a little better you\u2019ll see a little benefit in collections. Sanjit Singh - Wedbush: So I guess related to that, in Q1 we obviously had a number of high profile headlines attached with Target, Neiman Marcus. We had Heartbleed recently. How sustainable are these trends? I guess what I\u2019m getting at is they have all these headlines and that\u2019s driving some near term spending. Do you see any risk of that fading, or do you see other catalysts in your businesses? Do we have a core data center firewall, refresh going on that\u2019s going to provide you some sort of some sustainable good catalysts as we look into your 2014 guidance? Ken Xie : We don\u2019t quite see it direct like acceleration when there\u2019s this kind of news. It\u2019s \u2013 because it is there\u2019s a part of infrastructure and I think probably they can shop and educate the IT, the management long-term so sometime they may try to get additional protection or solution there. But if you look in the primary firewall pretty much all the enterprise they have Internet they need have some kind of protection. And something this kind of news they enable customer to add additional service or additional function to protect to do more protection. So that\u2019s where \u2013 but I don\u2019t see much directly linked changing into sales pattern here. Drew Del Matto : Yes. I mean it\u2019s just hard to imagine that these events won\u2019t continue to happen and I just add to Ken Xie. I think one of the things that becomes more apparent and perhaps after the recent NSS test, I do think people are starting to look at the test because there \u2013 it is a bit of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of ambiguity as to kind of which one\u2019s better and which performs and I think people are becoming savvy buyers, savvier buyers of security technology over time just like they became savvier buyers of ERP systems over time. And as the market matures and people become smarter, those tests are going to mean more. And the earlier questions are we getting any demand from that? You know, I think we\u2019re very focused on trying to make the market aware of the value of the test and utilize that to our advantage. Sanjit Singh - Wedbush: Great. And my last question, one of your primary competitors released a higher end data center focused solution. I was wondering if you came across that in the field during this quarter and how did you guys compete versus that particular solution? Ken Xie : I think we have been in the \u2013 more strong in this whether the carrier of data center solution and that shipping the 5000 platform for 10 years. So the first few minutes so actually 10 years ago 2004 is the chassis based and the (indiscernible) solution with a lot of virtual domesticity in there. So really we are ahead of competitor both on the performance and the function on the technology and then I think that even a lot of since we are starting like what they delivered on testing today I think is we are ahead of competitor. We don\u2019t see much competitor impact of what we have been doing. So far we\u2019re leading this, we\u2019re way ahead of competitors in this space. Sanjit Singh - Wedbush: Great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing our final question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP. Please go ahead. Erik Suppiger - JMP: Yes. Congratulations on a good quarter. First off, I am just curious on your guidance for the second quarter it doesn\u2019t show a lot of seasonal strength. I think typically you\u2019ve had a nice uptick in the June quarter and I\u2019m curious if there was anything in the March quarter that would have been kind of an anomaly why you would see things growing from there. And in particular I\u2019m curious if you think that the various breaches that you saw from Target and the like in late December, in late 2013, if that was much of a catalyst for some of the demand that you saw in the March quarter? Drew Del Matto : Yes, honestly, I\u2019ll just take the last part of that first, Erik. I think it would be a bit premature. Most of the larger corporations that would have probably been impacted by Target are probably going to have some sort of a cell cycle and evaluation and I would think that, that\u2019s longer than a three-month cell cycle, so we don\u2019t believe we saw much of an impact there yet, but hopefully going forward. As far as guidance goes I would think of it this way, we outperformed in Q1 and we are guiding to 17% year-on-year growth, which is a level we feel very confident in. And based on our growing \u2013 and certainly that\u2019s better than the 2x the market referenced that we were getting, right? Our deal profile is changing so we\u2019re shifting to larger deals, which generally have longer cell cycles. That, combined with new people \u2013 and we really are trying to be process driven on the sales side \u2013 campaign drive, process driven and some of those things. And I think for us, as we mature that process we\u2019ll obviously, that will give us perhaps better comfort going forward or whatever. I won\u2019t say we have a lack of comfort but there\u2019s just a new process in place, new people, and we just want to make sure we feel very comfortable with what we\u2019re saying with the guidance. I would say right now, currently, given all of that, our current forecast supports our current guidance. Erik Suppiger - JMP: Okay, very good. Similarly, on your guidance for the year for the operating margin, when I walk through my model here, it looks like you are looking for a relatively flat OpEx spend. I thought it would get into the latter two quarters of the year. And I know you\u2019re not giving guidance per se, but conceptually and mathematically, is that the right idea or why would you not be continuing to invest a little more aggressively than that? Drew Del Matto : So again, we are not \u2013 it\u2019s hard to address that right now. We\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re probably not going to give guidance more than we have on that front. Erik Suppiger - JMP: Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. And this does conclude our Q&A session for today. I\u2019d like to turn it back to your hosts for any concluding comments. Michelle Spolver - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Okay. I would just say thank you everybody. We went a little over on time, so thanks for everybody who is still on the call and listening through this. And we will have our second call in about a half hour, so anybody who has additional questions can feel free to call back into the call. There is a different call number it\u2019s in our press release that was issued in our earnings release today. Ken Xie - Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you. Drew Del Matto - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you very much. Operator : Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

With that, let me now turn the call over to Drew. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Michelle and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Fortinet had an excellent second quarter. Our growth strategy and increased investments in sales and marketing's are paying off. As evidenced by our ability to exceed expectations across all key operating metrics. Please let me share with you, our financial results for the second quarter. Our billings increased 33% year-over-year to $213 million significantly exceeding our guided range. Total revenue of $184 million was up 25% and also above the high end of our guidance. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margins were 16% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.11; both also above our guidance. And demonstrating the positive leverage of top line growth on the bottom line. Finally, our cash generation remains very strong as evidenced by the $34 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter. Before diving into details, let me talk a high level about what drove our strong financial results. We've been later focused on expanding and improving our sales capacity and effectiveness and increasing marketing awareness and lead generation, especially in the US enterprise market. This is to take advantage of the opportunities, we see the growth and gain market share and this is in fact happening. Not only did we see another quarter of strong growth and large deals closed, our enterprise business grew in the US, 73% year-over-year. We also continue to gain market share in the worldwide network security market growing 24% to 7.1% market share according to the latest IDC data. During the second quarter, we benefitted from our recent investments in sales hires. Ongoing expansion with National Enterprise resellers in the US. Strong demand for our recently introduced FortiGate 3700D and 1500D enterprise security appliances and improved marketing effectiveness, which resulted in Fortinet's inclusion in more RFP's. In addition, we experienced increased momentum and saw healthy spending within the enterprise. Primarily driven by firewall refresh and network upgrades. Network security threats are not going away, they are only increasing in number and sophistication. We've all seen this illustrated by the various recent high profile attacks and many others that don't make headlines. This is elevated the security discussion to the board level and is keeping investments at or near the top of IT investment priorities. We are confident, in our ability to address this market opportunity and are optimistic about maintaining our momentum. As Ken, will discuss in a few minutes; we have an extremely strong and differentiating product offering. This is boosted by the recent introduction of exciting new mid-range and high-end FortiGate products utilizing our FortiASIC NP6 processor that clearly set it separate from the competition. These along with our products and focus on effective innovation enable us to uniquely address enterprise and service providers next generation network security requirements. Additionally, our FortiGuard security subscription services drive adhesive long-term customer relationship and a healthy deferred revenue stream for the future. Now, let me dive deeper into our Q2 results which can be seen on Slide 3. As I just mentioned, billings were $213 million during the second quarter; an increase of $52 million or 33% year-over-year and significantly above our guidance range of $185 million to $190 million. This is strongest year-over-year billings growth we've seen in 13 quarters. From the geographic perspective, year-over-year billings growth was strong across all regions evidenced by the 40% growth in the Americas, which is also the strongest growth we've seen in 13 quarters and EMEA billings growth was 32%, the strongest in 14 quarters and APAC also performed well, growing billings 21% year-over-year. In the Americas, we are very pleased with our continued success in penetrating large enterprise data centers and closed a number of deals with Fortune 100 customers in the US. We also benefitted from focused efforts in investments in expanding and deepening our partnerships with large national resellers to focus on mid-sized enterprises and saw billings driven through these channel partners grow approximately 70% year-over-year. With regards to EMEA, our strong execution resulted in nearly all sub-regions over performing. We saw exceptionally strong results from the UK and Middle East as well as Central, Southern and Northern Europe. Similar to the Americas, we have benefitted from a strong return on our sales and marketing investments as well as continued momentum in capturing large enterprise data centers with our next generation firewalls. Lastly, we were very pleased with our performance in APAC. Primarily driven by strength in Japan, especially with large service provider deal as well as from Southeast Asia, China and India. Our ability to close large deals during the second quarter was also impressive evidenced by the fact that deals over $100,000 grew 38% to $263,000 from $190,000 in the same period last year. Deals over $250,000 grew 67% to 97% compared to 58% last year and deals over $500,000 grew 95% to 39% compared to 20% last year. We also once again had a growing number of deals over $1 million and our breakdown across our top five verticals remained relatively consistent with service provider at 24%, government at 12%, financial services at 10%, education at 9% and retail at 5%. Now turning to billings by product segment on Slide 4. We continue to see diversity of product billings across all segments. Our high-end FortiGate products accounted for 40% of billing, up from 35% in second quarter, 2013 and representative of our momentum in selling next generation firewalls to large enterprises. Our mid range enterprise products accounted for 26% compared to 28% last year and our entry level products which typically are deployed in enterprise branch offices and SMBs accounted for 34% compared to 37% last year. As a reminder, our product billings mix varies quarter to quarter based on the models of product, that make up all size deals. Moving now to revenue; during the second quarter total revenue was $184.1 million up 25% year-over-year and was significantly above our guidance range of $169 million to $172 million. This over performance was primarily driven by strong return on our sales and marketing investment and healthy network security market that I mentioned earlier. New product sales were also robust and contributed a product revenue increasing 28% year-over-year. We also saw a healthy attach rate of recurring services to these new product sales and evidenced by the net addition of $29 million to our deferred revenue balance, up strongly from the $19 million increase in first quarter, 2014. On a geographic basis, you can see on Slide 5 and 6 that revenues continue to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. Our strongest year-over-year revenue growth came from the Americas, which grew 31% to $78.4 million and now comprises 43% of total revenues. Among the key deals in the Americas region included a seven-figure data center firewall deal with an existing Fortune 50 technology customer, which is one of the most recognized brands in the world. In this deal, we competed with and replaced CheckPoint firewall in various areas of their expansive and complex network. Fortinet was chosen, due to our superior performance in capacity, high level of customer support as well as lower total cost of ownership. This was the largest deal in the Americas region during the quarter and this customer purchased dozens of our high-end FortiGate 3600D appliances. We won another seven-figure deal with a large US financial services company that was upgrading its entire network security infrastructure and required advanced security and performance for several data centers in many remote locations. This customer purchased our new FortiGate 3700D and 1500D enterprise next generation firewall appliances to protect its data centers and FortiGate 200D and 800C appliances for its varying size remote locations, along with our FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager and FortiAuthenticator products. VMC [ph] Juniper in this deal and beat out CheckPoint based on our superior performance advantage intelligent and detailed reporting and overall lower cost of ownership and finally, we won another large deal, which included our FortiGate 1500D appliances with a global service provider that is launching a new managed service to deliver secured, high-bandwidth satellite communications to business customers. A key requirement was Fortinet's very high performance and the ability to adapt to and integrate with specialized home grown application. We won this deal over Cisco. Now; turning to EMEA. Revenue with $62.6 million up 23% compared to $50.8 million last year and key deals included; a next generation firewall deal with a large European bank which was looking to refresh its firewall and consolidate with its intrusion prevention, point solution. They evaluated our products against a broad set of competitors including Palo Alto networks, CheckPoint, Juniper, Cisco and McAfee. Fortinet was chosen for our strong IPS features and security quality as evidenced by our certified superior catch rate and significantly better next generation firewall performance. We also beat up Cisco and Juniper on another enterprise next generation firewall deal with a European based public services company that purchased, our FortiGate 1500D appliances with our FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager products to secure its network. Fortinet was chosen primarily due to our unmatched performance as well as our ease of use and sophisticated centralized enterprise class management and analysis capabilities. Turning to APAC, revenues increased 18% year-over-year to $43.2 million from $36.6 million among the key deals in the region were, a seven-figure data center firewall win with an existing large service provider that needed increased capacity to support its growth. We beat out CheckPoint, Juniper and Huawei due to our ability to deliver the highest performance and lowest latency in a real world traffic testing environment. The deal also demonstrated Fortinet's competitive strength and the demanding GPRS mobile data service network environment. We also displaced Palo Alto and beat out Cisco and CheckPoint for the next generation firewall deal with a large university which was adding a new data center. They required a minimum 100-gigabits per second firewall throughput and 20-gigabits per second IPS. They were able to achieve this with our new FortiGate 3700D. We won this deal based on our ability to deliver robust firewall and IPS throughput in a single appliance, secure virtual domains and server zone segmentation and a cleaner network topography to integrate with the existing infrastructure. Finally, we won another large deal in Japan with one of the world's largest service providers and a global Fortune 50 Company. This customer purchased numerous high-end FortiGate products as the security platform to deliver a new virtualized firewall managed service for enterprises. We've won this deal over Cisco and Juniper based on the high quality of our products, responsiveness to the customer's specific requirements and overall best total cost of ownership. Let me now review the revenue breakdown by product and services, which can be seen on Slide 7. Product revenues increased 28% year-over-year to $85.4 million driven by strong adoption of our new FortiGate 3700D and 1500D enterprise security appliances, which offer best in class security protection while also utilizing our FortiASIC NP6 processor to provide the fastest speed at lowest latency available in their respective category. Services and other revenue grew to $98.7 million or 22% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to consistent growth in our FortiGuard subscription offerings and FortiCare support. Both offerings generating strong recurring revenue strength. Also annualized renewal rates continue to be in the mid 70% range. As a reminder, our renewal rates are tied to the hardware. So when a customer upgrades equipment, it counts as a new deal and not a renewal. With respect to headcount, shown on Slide 8. We ended the second quarter with 2,532 employees; a 16% increase over last year with the majority of the ads and sales. This is in line with our investment strategy to hire for growth with a focus on expanding sales capacity particularly in the Americas. Turning to non-GAAP expenses and profitability. During the second quarter, consolidated non-GAAP gross margins were 71% at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 60% and non-GAAP service gross margins were 81%. Both relatively consistent with last quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $102 million during the second quarter resulting a non-GAAP operating income of $29 million or 16% of total revenue above our guidance range of approximately 13% to 14%. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $18.6 million or $0.11 per share based on $168 million diluted shares outstanding and above our guidance of approximately $0.10 per share. The non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 37% reflecting an increase in the annualized rate 33% in first quarter to 35% for fiscal, 2014. As a result of a jurisdictional mix shift, where we have more income generated in the Americas due to strong Q2 performance from that region. And GAAP net income for the second quarter totaled $6.1 million or $0.04 per share compared to $9 million or $0.05 per share in the prior year period. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP financials can be seen on Slide 13 and 14. Now turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. In the end of Q2, with $911 million in cash and investments up from $888 million at the end of Q1. Looking at Slide 11, the increase was primarily driven by the $44 million in cash generated from operations. This was our 34th consecutive quarter of generating cash from operations exclusive of one-time items. We also remained debt free. Free cash flow was $34 million in the second quarter; an increase over our first quarter after excluding the $20 million patent related settlement payment from Palo Alto networks. Annualized inventory turns for Q2 were 2.4, above our goal to manage inventory turns at 2 or better. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $480 million, up $90 million year-over-year and $29 million sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to consistent renewals and services attached to new product sales. We continue to build an impressive deferred revenue stream, reflecting customer adoption of our suite of FortiGuard's security services and FortiCare support, which generate recurring subscription revenue and provide stickiness [ph] with our customers. Finally, during the second, we repurchased approximately 670,000 common shares for approximately $15 million. As of the end of June, we've repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares for a total of approximately $61 million at an average price of $19.60 under our $200 million stock repurchase program that we announced in December, 2013. $139 million remains available as of June 30, 2014. I will discuss our guidance in a bit, but first, let me turn the call over to Ken who will provide more color on the overall market, new product introductions and our competitive advantage. Ken Xie : Thanks, Drew. Fortinet's result over the last several quarter has been impressive and the second quarter further, our momentum. Our strong over performance in the second quarter clearly showcase that our core strategies paying off. Strong and consistency performance span an execution across all three geographies and continued strong momentum from our recently introduced high performance and the executed product are key drivers of our exceptional result. As Drew highlighted, our unapprised sales in the US are of focus investment growing 73% year-over-year. And a number of last yield over $500,000 crossed in Q2, the increase 95% year-over-year. Additionally, we saw increase in large RFP's due to more effective marketing and winning a number of a large high profile deals with some of the biggest enterprise, financial institutions and service providers and award. Fortinet's dedication to product innovation has always been our DNA with minds and the forefront of our business and continue to enable us to win and take market share against competitors. Customers consistently tell us, that our technology is the top notch and that is backed up the many third party certifications that Fortinet has been awarded for security factors. These certifications as well as and buyers third party test matter. As Drew said, with a good technology from adjusted marketing. We are in an exciting point in hand and exciting point of opportunity for Fortinet. Trend such as increasing high profile [indiscernible] pack, enterprise network firewall refresh and consolidation of security functions, next generation high-speed network build up and cloud computing all have put, equity in the top of sea level mind and IT priorities. I'm pleased to say that Fortinet put a line up and [indiscernible] map are the strongest it has ever been and we are in a excellent position to address and capitalize on these trends. Our FortiSandbox APT apprise, will only introduce a quarter into the market, has also been a high equally of a customer interest. This many large enterprise clearly testing product in their labs. Additionally, customer adoption has already been exceptional high for FortiGate 3700D and FortiGate 1500D enterprise next generation firewall appliance. Which consolidates a good functioning and integrate FortiASIC NP6 to deliver up to 100-gig per second on performance in a single appliance and offer 40-gigabit connectivity for next generation enterprise network. This product was recently introduced over the past few quarters and have ramp up quickly. In Q2, this product represent about 20% of FortiGate product building and it contributed to many of our large enterprise wins during the quarter. Several of which Drew just highlighted. Our FortiASIC NP6 represents significant innovation and experience in our competitive advantages. Powered by our certified FortiOS network security operation system and our new NP6 processors FortiGate appliance deliver advanced threat protection and industry best price performance to the mid market higher enterprise and service provider telecom market. I'm pleased to say, we have quickly bought FortiASIC NP6 advantage up and down of FortiGate product line. For the middle range, early this month we announced and begin shipping FortiGate 300D and 500D next generation firewall appliance that deliver 8 Gb per second and 16 Gb per second wireless speed, next generation firewall and IPS performance. Which is up to five times better than comparable price, competitive product? Combined with a successful national channel partnership, we believe this product position Fortinet well, would take this share, in a medium enterprise market. And early today, we announced several new product, high end FortiGate 5000 chassis-based series, that integrate our NP6 processor to deliver 1 terabit per second of firewall support. This is the game-changer for Fortinet and to the market. We are the first to actually deliver upon a promise of 1 terabit per second network security. The new FortiGate 5000 product including FortiGate-5144C chassis, FortiGate 5190CC [ph] and 519CC [ph] controller and FortiGate 5001D security blade that deliver 100 gig per second throughput. And enabled in a populate 14 slot chassis to deliver 1 terabit per second of performance. This new fifth generation of FortiGate 5000 product firmly position Fortinet as delivering the world fastest firewall making it ideal security solution for carrier, service provider, not enterprise who has the most demanding performance as ability requirement or network security and a need for accessibility and deliver high performance application and network protection to the customer and the users. Additionally, a change and improved security position on large enterprise that can segment, their network are now being in deeper security into the core without being prohibited by the historic performance bottleneck. One more recent announcement, I want to highlight early this month. We announced our FortiWeb VM, virtualized web application firewall product and now available on Amazon Web Service marketplace. We are flexible, pay as-you-go on-demand model. Providing the security as a service further extends Fortinet broad cloud computing solution as well as provide customer more purchasing flexibility and ability to skill their solution to cause effectively made immediately and future need. All of this wide and Fortinet competitive advantage considerably and are key drivers in our growth. Our result, over the last few quarters' show that we are executing well and our growth and investment strategy is working. The network security trend, I spoke of early combined with having the best product to address them present Fortinet which has a robust opportunity. I'm confident in our continued ability to grow and take share and meet the evolving security demand of a current and future customers. Now let me turn the call back to Drew, who will give the discussion of our finance guidance. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. I want to finish with our financial outlook for the third quarter, as well as provide some guidance for the full year 2014. Fortinet continues to benefit from the investments we've made in sales and marketing and product development. At the same time, as Ken just mentioned trends such as increasing high profile and sophisticated cyber attacks, network firewall refreshers, high performance next generation 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit Ethernet network build out and cloud computing are all putting security at the top of sea level minds and IP spending priorities. With focused execution and a superior and differentiated product portfolio strengthened by new products that utilize our FortiASIC NP6 processor. I remain very optimistic about Fortinet's ability to grow and gain market share. As a result, we plan to continue our investments for growth strategy and believe it is the right thing for our business and that it will yield returns over the long term. That said, we intend to continue to invest reasonably and responsible and as we shown during the second quarter realized leverage on the bottom line, where and when appropriate. With that in fact now, let me now provide specific guidance metrics starting with the third quarter of 2014, which can be seen on Slide 12. As a reminder, all of the guidance constitutes forward-looking statements subject to Michelle's cautions at the start of this call. We expect billings to be in the range of $195 million to $200 million up approximately 20% year-over-year the midpoint and represents growth of approximately 3 times market analyst forecasts from IDC and Gartner. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $182 million to $185 million up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% to 71%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 14% to 15% reflect in continued investments to drive growth and finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.11 per share based on an expected diluted share count in the range of $169 million to $171 million fully diluted shares. In terms of 2014, we are providing full year estimates. This updated forecast takes into account the over performance in Q2 as well as our expectations for Q3 and implied guidance for the fourth quarter. We believe that this represents a strong growth outlook for the second half of the year, primarily driven by the ongoing benefits of our increased sales capacity and improved marketing and the momentum of our differentiated technology, which continues to drive market share gains. As a result, we currently expect billings to be in the range of $835 million to $840 million up approximately 22% year-over-year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $735 million to $740 million up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% to 71%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 16% to 17% reflecting our continued growth investment, but still within our directional guidance range of 17% plus or minus a 0.1. and finally, we finally we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.47 per share to $0.48 per share based on an expected diluted share account in the range of $168 million to $170 million fully diluted shares. In closing, I'd like to thank our Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator, you may start the Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions) and we will take our first question from Brent Thill from UBS. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Good afternoon. Impressive enterprise business in the US and that was where my question was on, as it relates to the sustainability of that type of growth, you're seeing. I'm just curious, what you think has been the turn around there for you in terms of the increased tractions, as it relates to that surprise acceleration? Drew Del Matto : Well, thank you, Brent. I think it's really three things I mean there's sales execution for sure, the new products are certainly a tail win and we absolutely have an improved network security environment. If I look at the sales side, I think we're doing a nice job of on boarding people and getting them up to speed faster in sales. I think, they're also getting seeing the benefits of our you know, what I would say more focused market messaging and ability to generate leads from events and just various lead generation activities and then clearly, you can see on the product side 3700D and 1500D is doing very nicely. I think, they're resonating very well especially in the enterprise. We really feel like the performance there is unmatched in the competitive landscape and that's what our customers are telling us and we see that really and you know very savvy investors tend to be buying our products, so you know hopefully they're at the front end of the curve and show what's going to go broader later. And then just in general, you know it's no surprise anyone that the network security environment is robust. I would say that, we tend to see people buying looking to unify more functionality on a single device and I think our platform, our strategy plays right to that desire from the customers. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Great. Thanks. Operator : Okay. Thank you and our next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. So Keith, please go ahead. Melissa Gorham \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, this is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the high ends skews, you're seeing very good growth there. I'm just wondering particularly within the enterprise phase, if you could just maybe give the more color and kind of and where the boxes are going, are these met new opportunities, are you displacing encumbers when you're coming in, in the high end? Ken Xie : I think, most of replacing some of the existing firewall whether they are, too old, too slow. All they lack of the integrated function because we see the trends early, is a lot of a refresh in E&P infrastructure due to the highest network environment. I think, time as a consolidation of a security function because they said too difficult, too costly to manage different box on different vendors, was rarely too enough consolidation, with customers hear the feedback, is really very, very important, not only save the cost but also easy to manage and also can look into getting better. Drew Del Matto : Yes and Melissa it's true, let me just follow-up on that a bit. Certainly Ken's comments are spot on, but you'd asked the question I think very directly, are we acquiring new customers? The answer is absolutely yes. We really are seeing new customers and you know I would say that, exhibited in the deal sizes look at the deal sizes versus the past. You can tell, we are kind of shifting up stream in the enterprise and those are new names for us. I think the other thing you see, is you know we have in terms of coverage, when we look at sales performance. The broad based distributions, it's not coming from just kind of existing sales people, who have been here for a while, I think they're doing well. Well we could see, that we are kind of ramping up people and seeing them perform across the board very well, which certainly implies new name. So we absolutely believe, we are taking share. Melissa Gorham \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. So please go ahead. Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, a new segment of channel that's focused on the mid-sized enterprise. I wonder if you could give us some example of type of resellers that fits, have you not traditionally gone through that type of reseller and maybe what portion of the incremental growth is coming through this new channel? Michelle Spolver : Sterling, its Michelle. The type of resellers are not necessarily saying that this particular reseller was responsible for driving the revenue, but the type of resellers that you would be familiar with would be, like FishNet, CompCOM it does national business across the US that's really focused on mid-range type enterprise. So that came out for the first part of question. The second part, we have had relationship with those types of resellers, what we've done is part of our investing for growth strategy focused on the enterprise in the US is bit more focused, more attention, more investment, more resources too supporting and helping those type of partners grow their business. The third part is, we did not break out and then we are not going to break out exactly how much revenue they contributed to our overall billings for the quarter. Drew Del Matto : I do think, it's fair to say there were some channels opening up to us that probably didn't exist a year ago and that's a combination, I think of our investment and driving those relationships. I do think, some of them are actually looking for new relationship as they see some of the encumbers in the space maturing. Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay and then one follow-up, Drew. I don't know, I'm having trouble with access to slide, but I didn't see it on the slides about cash flow guidance for the year. Can you give us a sense of what you're thinking there? Drew Del Matto : Yes, we are not really giving cash flow. We are not giving free cash flow guidance. You know what I could, you know I think what most people tend to do is model in line with operating income and then, adjusted for CapEx items and maybe DSO or inventory turns. If that's there Sterling and I can kind of give you the CapEx, we probably will spend another $20 million in CapEx during the year. You know combination of some, we are growing. So we have some building up work in Sunnyvale and some other places and then we have an ERP project and few other items and so you know, maybe model, if I were modeling, I'd probably model $8 million of that in Q3 and maybe $12 million of that in Q4, it's a $20 million. So you know again, cut up that's how somebody might think about it. Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan: All right, great. Thank you, guys. Drew Del Matto : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Baird. So Jayson, please go ahead. Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird : Great, thank you. I'm going to try some questions on NP6 products. So it sounds like, there is new mid-range solutions with NP6 and then the chassis was just announced today. Are we most of the way through the new product launch cycle regarding NP6? Ken Xie : Not yet, NP6. Another process, we have a three [ph] key ASIC one we call the network processors, more go to the meter in high end and the countdown processor is rarely across the parallel line and also the SOC, system-on-a-Chip, more towards the lower end, mid range. So right now, we probably as half way of there, to refresh some of the appliance we have in the middle, high-end. Drew Del Matto : Yes and Jayson just to clarify, I mean the 3700D and the 1500D were really the only products available for sale with NP6 last year in Q2. Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird : Okay and then the chassis specifically the 5144C has this been in the hands of carriers for a while, for beta testing, etc? Ken Xie : There some has been and with some carrier, some other enterprise but it is still in early stage. Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird : And Ken, do you have much visibility and to how long that testing would take place and when you would start to see orders for this product? Ken Xie : I think they tend to take, maybe 6 months to 12 months. Michelle Spolver : Yes, some of the customers that are familiar with the products that might not take 12 months to test that product and some are testing them now, but I think the point is, that it's a longer testing cycle than it would be in a mid range product. So good to know, that you're question is going and how much revenue you expected in Q3 for that. I mean, it's a little bit longer for ramp up time, now. Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan: This will play out for some while, this chassis. Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Okay, thank you and our next question comes from Robert Breza from Sterne Agee. Mr. Robert, please go ahead. Robert Breza \u2013 Sterne Agee : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the quarter. Either for Drew or for Ken, I'm wondering if you talk to sales capacity either be on the street in the terms of maybe qualitatively or quantitatively. How many people you've added and then as you invested in the channel, can you talk to us at least qualitatively how you think about adding capacity? And maybe your plans to continue to add that capacity. I'm really looking forward, how we think about going into FY' 2015 in the back half of year 2014. Drew Del Matto : Well, I think we give a little bit of a trend on type account and where it's guarded. You could see, that we've grown I think headcount what do we think, 50% over a year ago, with really the bulk of that in sales, really a bulk of that in sales. I mean the market spend is some people, but it's other, you know it's obviously events and lead gen and that type of thing. The way we characterize, the way I look at it, right now with getting into absolute numbers Robert, would be more about how people are performing and we look very closely at performance distribution and you know we can see the people who have tenure, you know say in the roles, certainly a year longer are performing consistently kind of at or above quota. And then below that, they're actually performing nicely. You know, we don't have a lot of expectation for people who are here less than 6 months, but we are actually getting some productivity out of those people and you know that may well be more on the channel side or maybe they're brining existing relationship, but we are seeing good productivity between people coming on board mostly hit the six-month cycle. They tend to be producing, you know I wouldn't say quite at quota, but very nicely probably a little better than I would expect and then certainly been here longer, people performing very well and very consistent globally and as we look at, where the investments have been focused. You know and I would stress the US enterprise has been the bulk of the good news and that's where the investments come. Robert Breza \u2013 Sterne Agee : Perfect, thank you. Maybe a quick follow-up, Drew. I think, in your prepared remarks some you've talked, either carrying yourself about I think it was 20% of the bookings, I think came from new product or recently introduced products. Can you just, maybe add a little bit more color around the new product contribution to the acceleration and billings growth? Drew Del Matto : What are you, I think the 20% is kind of tells that? Robert, what are you trying to get out? Robert Breza \u2013 Sterne Agee : Probably speaking more, as we think forward as you introduce new products, is this trend likely to continue as people look till you drive increased capacity in terms of the newer products as customers are driving to this refresh, is it really about being etc capacity, that was more of that thought. Ken Xie : I think the two products made about 20% contribution in Q2 is the 3700D and 1500D. There are some, we've tried some new opportunity but also replacing some of the old product on the 3000 series and also 1000 series. There's a combination of met new ad and also some of the old product replacement. I think each new generation $10 billion for the performance 3x to 5x better than the previous generation because the ASIC chip because the CPU because the other network device, the chip we put in to system. So that's I think is the new contribution, from the 20% but if you look in all the, it's about 40% of this come from, we call the high end product. So that's where the two new product we introduced starting ramp up over quickly. Drew Del Matto : Yes and I just to add, Robert. I mean a little bit kind of gets back to Jayson's question about cycle times or you know how long, things in testing, how long do they take to ramp up? We announced the 300D and 500D earlier in July, again people are really just getting their hands on those products and it takes a little while. I think, as you go kind of downstream maybe some of them come quicker but you know as you're looking the, where we have been focused one of the hard things about, what we are doing is, a lot of newer investments in sales and marketing around enterprise customers and you shift up in the enterprise, you know we're really trying to get a beat on how long that deal cycle is and that's a little tougher to predict, especially with a lot of new products and a lot of new people, but that being said I'm kind of looked so somewhat fresh to reporting that. I've gone back and looked at history because I'm interested in same question and when we've had product releases, you do see, you certainly see a tailwind over a period of time. I'm not sure, it's immediate but definitely there is an uptick at some point. Michelle Spolver : And the last thing I would add to is that, I mean, you're excited about the new product that robust set of products and it is built into the increased guidance that we've delivered. Ken Xie : And also, company want to say, if you look in the high end product like 5000 chassis base, most equal to service provider take a little longer testing time. The 300D, 500D is relative to the middle range, as probably will be ramp up soon and quicker. The 3700D and the 3000 series and the 1000 series probably in the middle. So that's where, like when announced this quarter the 300D, 500D that's probably ramp up maybe faster and then 5000 tend to take a little bit longer time to in the testing process. Robert Breza \u2013 Sterne Agee : Very helpful, thanks. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you and our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. So Jonathan, please go ahead. Jonathan Ho \u2013 William Blair : Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just wanted to get a little bit more of a sensor around the verticals that you're seeing to strengthen for the enterprise products. I mean, are there any particular verticals that standout or any areas, where you're seeing more distribution channel traction? Drew Del Matto : You know it tends to be, also bit qualitative but I would say that, it tends to be the most savvy customers. You know, what I when I look at the names they tend to be tech savvy customers, kind of cutting edge looking for kind of, definitely looking for that blend certified security performance along with fast network performance. You can go into the tech space definitely, there is absolutely some financial services in there and there is always a bit of carrier, of course. Jonathan Ho \u2013 William Blair : Got it and just as we take a look at sort of the traction that you're getting through the distribution channel, I mean how would you sort of attribute the success between either you've seen an increased number of opportunities or bake-offs versus a higher win rate, like have you guys seen traction on both side? Just want to get a sense of where that defense are showing up. Drew Del Matto : I think it's both. Yes, we do very well \u2013 we've always done well at bake-offs. I think we are getting and we are absolutely getting more attention. I mean people are telling us, they would like us to give more attention, in fact that's a feedback. Michelle Spolver : Yes and that is been our challenge, more of the challenges in the past to compete in the bake-offs. We do very, very well. There's opportunities out there, that we want to team in because lack of awareness as for whatever, but we did talk about in our commentary that we were saying, what we did in Q2 seen increase in, being included in RFP's which certainly help us more business driven through the mid-range channel, low-end channel built in through usual, which is good. Drew Del Matto : Yes and to be fair, I mean, we've certainly invested more in marketing to get that awareness out there, but we still view there's opportunity there, that would be the feedback that we've seen and we absolutely take that seriously and we will continue to invest. Jonathan Ho \u2013 William Blair : Got it, just in terms of the Wi-Fi access point market. Can you guys maybe talk a little bit about sort of the products that you have there and maybe some of the traction that you guys having on that side? Ken Xie : Yes, lot of old customers especially lot of under price, we're starting to see the need of expanding Wi-Fi, but also they're frustrated about, have to have two infrastructure, two kind of way to manage wired or Wi-Fi. So that's where 40-gig is kind of where, UTM or on EDGE and firewall. We build some Wi-Fi controller function in there and we used some extend, AP is world-wide enterprise customer. So they see it's lot easy, simple to manage but also wired is environment. So that's where we see some healthy growth. Eventually, small but as we see the ramp up pretty quick. Jonathan Ho \u2013 William Blair : Great. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you and our next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP. Erik, please go ahead. Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP: Thank you, congratulations. I would like to have some perspective on how much of the acceleration you've seen in your growth sequentially was really attributable to stronger market versus how much change in your execution. You'd said that you're seeing refresh cycle pick up, was that material improvement or material change from where you just in the March quarter or how much has the market changed just in the last 90 days? Drew Del Matto : I don't think much. You know, look I think part of it you need the capacity to actually go talk to the customers and bring in the orders, but I think again the blend of having some level of awareness, what quarter that is, who they're are and what we represent, that product brand awareness before we go there, so that we can get in the door and sale matters and then having somebody actually go in there and calling the customer. So I think, that makes a big difference. You know if you go back, a year of the capacity, just would have been there. Now over the last and then the capacity or the productive capacity certainly increased in the last three months. I haven't seen a huge shift in the market. You know I mean, the headlines continue but I don't know that they have drove any immediate change and how people are spending and in last 90 days. Ken Xie : I think compared to one year ago definitely the market is better, but we still also waiting for the overall market data like from IDC or Gartner try to see what's it hold, this year, the whole market growth definitely will be better than last year, but have to see compared to Q1 as Drew said, not a lot of difference. On other side, I think new part we are starting to see a lot of advantage like just we are now supposed to 1500D, which company in Q2, but also the 300D, 500D. We say the 5x matter on the next gen firewall performance than the comparative product. So it is really we see, more advantage, more differentiation of our product comparison, compared to product. Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP: So if it's really driven by some noted changes across your product line and your execution. Why would you expect sequential decline in billings as you go into the September quarter, is a seasonal effect or what would change going into September? Drew Del Matto : Well, look I think you know we had a very strong Q2 and I think, also when you look at the comparative versus Q2 last year, it was bit of a lower bar relative to Q3. I would also note that, we are upping our guidance, we were saying 2x the market, now we are basically saying, we are roughly saying 3x the market, so that's a lot. I would also point out, look we have a lot of new people, products, systems and processes to follow and you know so we are being very prudent and you know calling it, like our people see it, you know today again I would say we see pretty good model. But you know we feel like, we have a better pulse on the ability to be affective in any given point and time base on the front and you know that's how we are kind of getting up. So I would look at more of kind of glass up full, with a glass half empty situation quite frankly. Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP: Okay, fair enough. On the competitive front as you've expanded a little bit into the mid market and had some real good penetration in large enterprise. Are you seeing any vendors more than you were before, if you look at kind of incumbencies Cisco, Juniper, CheckPoint or any dynamic changing there and then do you see any change in terms of competition with Palo Alto? Ken Xie : Not much in, I think we also start and had some marketing that is few some time the middle market, you probably need a bit more marketing to get in there and also we are working closely with our channel partner. They're starting to see the benefit of the product, but from competitor side I don't see much difference maybe few, Michelle any? Drew Del Matto : No, I think that's fair. Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP: Okay, last quick question. Juniper yesterday had noted some carrier changing behaviors with carrier CapEx that was kind of clouding visibility have you seen any change in terms of carrier priorities of where they're putting their investments or any change on the service provider front? Ken Xie : No, we did not see much change. Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP: Very good. Well, thank you and congratulations. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from James Wesman from Raymond James. Please go ahead, James. James Wesman \u2013 Raymond James : Good afternoon, most of my questions have been answered. Drew, just a quick question on cash flow. For the year, I believe last quarter you'd said you were comfortable with about $36 million or $37 million and modeled cash taxes for 2014, are you still comfortable with that? Drew Del Matto : Yes. James Wesman \u2013 Raymond James : Great and then just a quick follow-up. In the quarter, can you guys just talk about the linearity with it, where your expectations were did you find the quarter was more back and loaded, any color there would be appreciated? Drew Del Matto : You know and I think this came up last quarter, cash flow. We have a very, we had better linearity than we had traditionally. I think in Q1, we had very consistent linearity with Q1 let's say, so it had approved over the prior year and the year's before that, it's actually becoming more linear and you know perhaps the channel, it has something to do with that, where that's more of kind of, if you know think about the larger direct stuff tends to be more back and loaded, whereas channeled businesses tend to be more flow handed if you will, even flow. James Wesman \u2013 Raymond James : All right, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. Gray, please go ahead. Gray Powell \u2013 Wells Fargo : Hi, thanks for taking the questions, just a couple. So hopefully you haven't touched on this too much yet, but can you talk about the investment in sales and marketing and specifically just where that's going, is that more enterprise sales reps or investment in the channel or buying leads or maybe something else, you're not thinking of? Drew Del Matto : You know, it's those things and I mean, you know, we're really I mean that's right we're buying sales \u2013 absolutely investing in sales capacity. I would say any one area, if I had to pick out anything. Singularly focused, I would say probably mostly the US enterprise. I think that probably comes across in the results as well, we continue to believe that's an area of opportunity for us. I mean, if you look at us we are 43% US, most tech companies probably have a little higher weighing on the US and we feel like, we have a little relative opportunity there. Let's just say and we would circle the US enterprise as what would potentially get us closer to 48% or 50%. I would make that \u2013 stick at those numbers but, it's kind of how we think about it, if you will and you know that takes feet on the street. It takes some channel and then it takes some awareness as well and you know, we are doing more events absolutely, more trade shows and a lot of lead gen, quite frankly. And that's all I would think about it. Gray Powell \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, that's helpful and then you talked about customer interest in your new FortiSandbox appliances. Does that, have a material contribution in Q2 and how should we think about that for the second half of the year, could that be a more meaningful impact as we look to Q3 and Q4? Drew Del Matto : I would say it's a bit early, I think we've seen our product basically came out in March. I think we are getting really, I would characterize that it is very good interest, we are seeing quite a few trials, hard to predict when those will close, I don't think people are, as we our sales were up, when will this close. You know they're just saying people are really evaluating the products very closely at this point. So kind of hard to predict and you're coming off a low number. Again, so you know when you do close the deals just keep in mind it's going to be a very low day and so it'd be hard to expect a huge contribution over the next six months. Ken Xie : Also the FortiSandbox, we have the benefit actually working together with FortiGate. So which kind of linked together for then provision to the attack, compared to some other vendor whether they are working with separate vendor in the firewall and some detection mode, so the combination of Sandbox and FortiGate. We get quite well position, well welcome by the customer because they kind of make all this total solution, working together well. Drew Del Matto : And I think that was one of the items, I was trying to point out earlier, where we're looking at the drivers. I think the first question I got, what were the drivers of the quarters and we absolutely do see a desire from customers to consolidate functionality on network security platform and that's one of the advantages we have with the scope of our products. Gray Powell \u2013 Wells Fargo : Got it. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much and congratulations. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Mr. Walter, please go ahead. Jim Fish \u2013 Citi: How it's going guys? It's actually Jim on for Walter here. Kind of going off the FortiSandbox you know with a full quarter of that, now under your bulks I believe, you launched the end of 1Q. how are you seeing this being sold with, is it more new budget or is it shifting budget around and is it more, are you able to get kind of more customer based off of that given kind of what happened with the NSS test? Drew Del Matto : Yes, definitely the NSS test is out there, you know I don't -- if you guys saw those reference in the New York Times article yesterday. We haven't again, as we just said we haven't thought a lot of it yet and so it's hard to predict that budget will come, you know those conversations really are to follow, but again I think it goes back to the consolidation around network security platform. I would have to imagine that, there are other areas of security that will probably continue to commoditize, so I think that provides some of that opportunity some of that funding but you have to also believe that security, one of the other dynamics I mentioned is simply that security is a high priority. It's hard to imagine that it's not on the top two or three of any priorities. And so ultimately, if people have a limited budget, it's going to crow something else out. There is something else, they're not going to do or not renew and that would play to our favor. Ken Xie : Yes, I think as somehow my feedback is kind of more come from some additional new budget because of the high be on a current like, what are firewalls, some other security, but on the other side, it's a lot of strong demand is ready to be act together with firewall to prevent our attack instead of just reporting there in the next layer, probably tried to detect, and then you cannot take an action kind of makes it even worse, as a kind of hinders a lot of us. I mean kind of make a lot of even worse, if you only detect and cannot take action. So that's where we see the situation has to be combined together with the network security anyway and working with Sandbox together, so it's total solution is very, very important to prevent attack, instead of just detect. Drew Del Matto : And Jim one, you know one important I think feature when you think about how budgets happen and how people afford to buy those who make room. We've met with a couple of customers, larger customers. Who say they're under pressure to reduce their IT budget, but improve their security effectiveness and they like the idea and this goes back to the point of consolidation around a single device unifying around a single network security architecture. You know because we can actually help them do that and again these are in terms of sales cycle, it takes a little longer time to do that because it's a broader architecture than a individual point in a network. It's kind of a broader platform architecture, but you know that is something, that we're, you know when I talk to customers, certainly that's come up several time, how can you help us reduce overall cost. I know, I think I'm getting pressure on both sides, I have to do this. I have to increase my security effectiveness but at the same time, I'm getting slammed on my budget and you know, I think we're uniquely positioned to help people do that. Jim Fish \u2013 Citi: Okay, great that was great guys and then just one more from me. In terms of kind of going off, what lot of others here are saying, with the sales and marketing, hiring. Should we think about that accelerating in terms of actual position like throughout like in the back half of the year or should it be kind of just stable from here on out. Drew Del Matto : You mean stable hiring or? Jim Fish \u2013 Citi: Yes, are you looking to accelerate hiring into the second half from what you did already or is it going to be stable relative to what you've done in the first half. Drew Del Matto : Well, we're going to continue to invest. I think, we gave the margin guidance. So I think it's generally consistent with the ramp, we have been on. Jim Fish \u2013 Citi: Okay, great. Good quarter, guys. Drew Del Matto : There's a little bit of, quite honestly I have to take August into account globally people are on vacation, holiday's and how fast you can actually bring people in the door and sometime it's, I think the last quarter, I just anecdotally is probably a better quarter to hire people. If you get in the summer months, it's a little tougher as you approach the fall through the end of November probably little easier, slowed down in December. Jim Fish \u2013 Citi: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Shaul Eyal \u2013 Oppenheimer: Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, guys. Impressing results, congratulations. Drew, one more question on the hills [ph] of the prior and the sales and marketing and hiring. So you guys ended the quarter, a little over 2,500 headcount. What should we be expecting by the end of fiscal 2014 another 5%, maybe 10% increase in headcount, maybe just a range? Drew Del Matto : Yes, I really don't have a range on that. I think, I would just go up the mark. I would go off the margin guidance, it's just too hard to predict. Shaul Eyal \u2013 Oppenheimer: Fair enough, now as you guys continue to bring in people and the business accelerates, can Drew \u2013 what's the thinking about the COO position, to looking or is it something Drew that you're running going to be officially running? Ken Xie : We will keep the field position open, I think and we also keep in recruiting the other executive, who can help in, if we're not keeping growing, keeping like meet us to the next stage. Shaul Eyal \u2013 Oppenheimer: Got it. One final question, really high level question on the product front. So when looking at the high end data center, high end high pricing product. When the customer is finally making the investment decision to put this money to work? Are you think cases, whereby customers will be buying a growing number of those appliances driven partly by increased redundancy needs, is that part of the decision making process on the high end front? Ken Xie : I think, when they design architecture in the beginning, the designer is not in there, so that's where we see a lot of opportunities ready with fresh, of the old infrastructure relatively slow and also the lack of the some of the security function like whether the mall work detection prevention and all the intrusion and the application kind of come in. The redundant especially for the service provider, some data centers quite important should be in there already but is, I think the new product, we'll be launching like the fresh out in today and also some other. It's a fifth generation, we're launching the 5000. For all, this is five generation, they all have the redundant to make us probable in business is needed to change. Shaul Eyal \u2013 Oppenheimer: Got it. Thank you for that, Ken. Really helpful, congratulations. Operator : Okay. Thank you and our last question comes from Daniel Ives from FBR. Daniel, please go ahead. Daniel Ives \u2013 FBR: Thanks for fitting me in. So certainly, on the high end obviously lot of strength in the large deal especially over $2,550,000. I guess the question is like, a year from now I mean do you that as the bigger and bare component. Obviously, have been a key part of your success. I'm just trying to understand the strategy going forward. In terms of on the high end, how much you're going to sort of bet there, what products and executions. Obviously been massively successful within over next six months. How much more room you think, you have to go, is that the most fertile opportunity on the hand? Thanks. Ken Xie : I think so far, we see the architecture, the platform we have with the combination of our own ASIC with the CPU and also other chip on the market. We started the fresh and more with the competitor, most of them only depend on the so far CPU to deliver function. So when you try to have a consolidated function or the function also, try to meet a high speed new infrastructure demand. The 40-gig platform tend to perform and function much better. So that, I think you can see the new chip we put in the 500D it's really a lot of our advantage and also the middle, we also believe the new 5000 will also apply an additional advantage we have, I think that's probably more towards the high end and then we also have the chip. We code SOC, the system-on-a-chip and that's also applied at the low end because that can lower the cost, that's the benefit of ASIC. You can improve the performance compared with the sell for the loss [ph] a lot like, mentioned like a 10x above and also you can lower the cost, once the quantity is larger. So it's kind of atoning how the skill, so once we have the skill. We have the number, we can also lower the cost, not only on the system but also some other operation cost. So that's where we see some benefit on both end, but it will also take time. So we need to take time to ramp up the new product, we also need to take time to really build the infrastructure, build a team to reach our level. Michelle Spolver : Okay. Well, operator. I think that was our last question, I believe. So I would say, we have another call at 3 :30 Pacific Time for those of you, as you're working through models and your follow-up questions. please feel free to call back and if that time, there's a different calling number, that's in our press release, but thank you for taking the time to be on our call and looking forward to, talking to you again at 3 :30 and then throughout the quarter. Operator : Okay, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

With that, let me now turn the call over to Drew. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Michelle and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Fortinet again reported a very strong quarter. We continue to execute well and benefit from strong adoption of our new FortiGate products powered by our FortiASIC NP6 processor, returns on our sales and marketing investments and a healthy network security environment. Globally, all three regions performed well and we were particularly pleased with our continued impressive growth in the U.S. enterprise, which grew 30% year-over-year during the third quarter. In addition, the number of large deals, greater than $500,000, grew 84% year-over-year. We are winning new customers and expanding our footprint within our base of 200,000 existing customers, which already includes the majority of the Fortune Global 100. This impressive growth is a trend we\u2019ve seen for the past several quarters and further evidence that our strategy to continue to penetrate the enterprise market is working. Something to highlight is that enterprise customers are very valuable to us. They are sticky. Meaning they tend to bring a high renewal rate and the opportunity for account expansion through additional and broader purchases overtime. This trend shows not only a high level of satisfaction with Fortinet and our products but also, that enterprises are high value targets and our investments today will bring more benefit overtime. This also provides an opportunity for positive margin leverage in the future. Now, turning to our Q3 results, I am pleased to say we once again outperformed across our key operating metrics exceeding our quarterly guidance and again demonstrating that our strategy is working. Our billings increased 29% year-over-year to $213 million, significantly exceeding our guided range. Total revenue of $193 million was up 25%, also above the high-end of our guided range. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margins were 16%, above our guidance and non-GAAP EPS was $0.12 also above our guidance and demonstrates the positive leverage of top-line growth on the bottom-line. Finally, our cash generation remains very strong as evidenced by the $51 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter and representing 128% increase year-over-year. Before diving into details, let me talk at a high level about the business drivers during the quarter. We continue to see very strong demand for our new products and a healthy security environment. The acceleration of the size and frequency of data breaches globally has resulted in significant cost, both financial and brand-related, for enterprises. As a result, in many cases, cyber security has become the top business and spending priority for enterprises. As reported earlier this month, a recent global IT security census commissioned by Fortinet and administered by the independent market research firm Lightspeed GMI found that 90% of CIOs and CTOs believe the job of keeping their enterprise protected is becoming more challenging and that boardroom pressure to keep the enterprise secure has jumped almost one-third in the last year. This survey concluded that security is the primary consideration, both in and over, other business initiatives. The global IT security census is available on fortinet.com and provides a variety of interesting end-user insights. For better security and operational efficiencies companies are increasingly realizing the necessity of integrating security functionality in the firewalls. A concept Fortinet helped pioneer nearly 15 years ago. These integrated next-generation firewalls are driving firewall upgrades and new opportunities for Fortinet. With Gartner estimating that approximately 70% of new enterprise Edge Firewalls purchased will be integrated next-generation security platforms. As Ken will discuss in a few minutes, Fortinet\u2019s extremely strong in differentiated next-generation firewall product offering is technically superior to the competitions. This is supported by the recent NSS Labs\u2019 independent third-party test of next-generation firewalls in which Fortinet products were recommended and positioned in the upper right quadrant. We are only about halfway through a refresh cycle of new high performance FortiGate appliances leveraging our latest FortiASIC NP6 processor. Customer adoption for the products, and else thus far, has been very high and is driving numerous enterprise wins with both new and existing customers. Last week, we announced our new FortiGate 3810D, which integrates the NP6 processor to deliver the world\u2019s fastest network security firewall performance in the security appliance. Fortinet has a clear competitive advantage and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from enterprise network firewall upgrades where higher performance, integrated features and verified excellent security are required. Advanced persistent threats continue, during the quarter we saw better than anticipated traction with our recently announced FortiSandbox APT appliances and cloud-based FortiGuard APT subscription services. While still new to the market we\u2019re pleased with the high level of demand from our customers. Impressively, we already account more than 3,000 customers using our APT subscription services. Additionally, we\u2019re also seeing traction with our partnership with Amazon Web Services whereby certain of our virtualized software security products are offered in conjunction with Amazon\u2019s cloud-based Web services offering both on traditional and the utility pay-as-you-go pricing model. Although this partnership is in its early stages there are already more than 100 customers using our virtualized products in AWS environments. One of Fortinet\u2019s differentiators is our BAB portfolio of network, content application and endpoint security products that enable us to fulfill customer\u2019s comprehensive security requirements. We believe that our growth is predicated on both winning new customers and expanding our footprint within our base of 200,000 existing customers which includes the majority of the global Fortune 100. During the third quarter we did both well. As I mentioned, new enterprise customers bring significant lifetime value which we believe will help our long-term growth and profitability. A few new customer wins during the third quarter included a multi-phased 7 figure deal with one of North America\u2019s largest utilities that was establishing a new standard within its datacenters. We beat incumbent Cisco and contenders Juniper and Palo Alto Networks for this deal and the customers selected our FortiGate 1500D next-generation firewall and FortiAnalyzer reporting and analysis appliances. We also won a 6 figure deal with the leading Fortune 500 cloud company an innovator that selected our FortiGate 3700D and 1500D high performance appliances at the standard firewall to secure its global datacenters. We won this deal over Palo Alto Networks, Check Point and Cisco based on superior security performance. In Europe we won a 7 figure new deal with one of the region\u2019s largest telecommunications carrier. This customer is upgrading security and consolidating many datacenters into a few. They selected our FortiGate 3700D next-generation firewall appliances and FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager systems over Cisco and McAfee due to our superior performance and network integration capabilities. And we won another enterprise datacenter next-generation firewall deal with an extremely sophisticated foreign government agency that was also upgrading all of its datacenter infrastructure and required the highest level of performance, as well as multi-capped firewalling, expansive virtual domains and other advanced networking features. Our high-end FortiGate 5000 chassis-based systems as well as several FortiGate enterprise appliances were selected over products from incumbent Check Point and Cisco. We also successfully expanded our footprint into existing customers in most case displacing incumbent competitors. Some of these wins included a large 7 figure deal with a Fortune 25 technology company for which we will be supporting the global expansion of one of the largest and most trusted cloud infrastructure networks in the world. This was an enterprise datacenter firewall deal with an extremely technology-forward company that included our FortiGate 3700D high performance security appliances. This deal never went out to competitors to bid based on the customer\u2019s high level of satisfaction with the Fortinet and their prior deployment. We grew our business within a large U.S. financial services customer that is currently using Fortinet as their core firewall and was bidding an advanced persistent threat project. After thorough testing they chose our FortiSandbox APT appliance over FireEye due to our strong proven detection and prevention capabilities. Also, our ability to integrate with the existing Fortinet next-generation firewall solution for improved security was a critical differentiator. In addition, we won a 6 figure multi-product expansion deal with a Fortune 500 service provider that was an existing firewall customer. This customer is expanding its managed security services platform to include Web application security as well as advanced persistent direct detection services and selected our FortiWeb and FortiSandbox appliances over products from Check Point, Imperva and FireEye. Another 6 figure expansion deal was with a Fortune 100 telecommunications operator that was upgrading its antispam and remote access managed services. This customer selected our FortiMail email security appliances as well as additional FortiGate enterprise next-generation firewall appliances over products from Cisco and Palo Alto Networks. Our increased enterprise sales and marketing presence, improved execution and an impressive and differentiating arsenal of products are enabling us to acquire new customers, expand deeper and more strategically into existing customers and gain market share. Now, let me dive deeper into our Q3 results which can be seen on Slide 3. As I mentioned previously, billings were $213 million during the third quarter, an increase of $48 million or 29% year-over-year and significantly above our guidance range of $195 million to $200 million. From a geographic perspective, year-over-year billings growth was strong across all regions, particularly in the EMEA where billings grew 42% year-over-year, the strongest in 15 quarters. Americas\u2019 billings grew nicely at 25% and APAC also performed well, growing billings 20% year-over-year. In EMEA, our strong growth was primarily due to ongoing demand from our FortiGate enterprise products. We, once again saw strength in most of Europe and the Middle East. We were especially pleased with our performance in the UK, where we more than doubled the rate of growth year-over-year due to the leverage we are seeing from the investments made in upgrading and expanding our salesforce and the channel. We also saw good uptick in sales of non-FortiGate appliance products, including our FortiSandbox, FortiWeb and FortiDDOS appliances and FortiAP secure access points. With regard to the Americas, we had another quarter of solid growth and success in penetrating large enterprise datacenters as our investments in sales and recent investments in marketing are paying off. Specifically, we\u2019ve added strong enterprise sales people and are also continuing to expanding and deepen partnerships with large national resellers that focus on midsized enterprises. As I mentioned earlier, we were very pleased with growing the U.S. enterprise business over 30% year-over-year. Lastly, APAC also performed well driven by strength in Japan as well as in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, China and India. Growth in large deals are a good way to measure Fortinet\u2019s traction in the enterprise and high-end. During the third quarter deals over $100,000 grew 48% to 276 from 187 in the same period last year. Deals over $250,000 also grew 48% to 90 compared to 61 last year, and deals over $500,000 grew 84% to 35 compared to 19 last year. We also, once again, had a growing number of deals over $1 million. Our breakdown of billings across our top-five verticals remained relatively consistent with service provider at 22%, government at 13%, financial services at 10%, education at 8% and retail at 6%. Now turning to billings by product segment on Slide 4, we continue to see diversity of product billings across all segments. Our high-end FortiGate products accounted for 35% of billings, down from 40%, in Q3 of last year. Although, sales of our FortiGate 1500D and 3700D enterprise-class next-generation firewall appliances continued on a similar place as last quarter. We saw an acceleration in sales of our mid-range enterprise products, which accounted for 29% of the total product billings, an increased compared to 26% last year and driven by sales of our new FortiGate 300D and 500D next-generation firewall appliances for the mid-enterprise. Our entry level products, which typically are deployed in enterprise branch offices and SMBs, accounted for 36% compared to 34% last year. As a reminder, our product billings mix varies quarter-to-quarter based on the model of products to make up all sized deals. Moving now to revenue, during the third quarter, total revenue was $193.3 million, up 25% year-over-year, and above our guidance range of $182 million to $185 million. Similar to Q2 2014, the overall performance was primarily driven by the strong execution in return on our sales and marketing investments and a healthy network security market. New product sales were also robust and contributed to product revenue increasing 26% year-over-year. We also saw a healthy attach rate of recurring services to these new product sales as evidenced by the net addition of $20 million to our deferred revenue balance, which now totals $500 million, and up 25% over last year. On a geographic basis, you could see on Slides 5 and 6, the revenues continued to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. In the Americas, revenues grew 26% to $82.2 million from $65.4 million last year and now comprise 43% of total revenues. EMEA revenues were $66.2 million, up 29% compared to $51.4 million last year, and APAC revenues increased 19% year-over-year to $45 million from $37.9 million last year. Now, let me review the revenue breakdown by products and services, which can be seen on Slide 7. Product revenues increased 26% year-over-year to $87.7 million, driven by continued adoption of our new FortiGate 3700D and 1500D enterprise security appliances. Services and other revenue grew to $105.6 million, or 24% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to consistent growth in our FortiGuard subscription offerings and FortiCare Support, both which generated strong recurring revenue streams. Also annualized renewal rates continue to be in the mid 70 percentage range. As a reminder our renewal rates are tied to hardware so when a customer upgrades equipment it counts as a new deal and not a renewal. With respect to headcount shown on Slide 8, we ended the third quarter with 2,721 employees, a 22% increase over last year. The majority of the adds were in sales and marketing. This is in line with our investment strategy to hire for growth and focus on expanding sales capacity especially in the enterprise segment. Turning to non-GAAP expenses and profitability, during the third quarter consolidated non-GAAP gross profit margins were 72%, which is above our guided range. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 60% consistent with last quarter as we remained focused on acquiring new customers for long-term value. Non-GAAP service gross margins were 81% also consistent with last quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $107.9 million during the third quarter resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $30.4 million or 16% of total revenue above our guidance range of approximately 14% to 15%. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $20 million or $0.12 per share based on 170 million diluted shares outstanding and above our guidance of approximately $0.11 per share. The non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 35%. And GAAP net income for the third quarter totaled $4.1 million or $0.02 per share compared to $11 million or $0.07 per share in the prior year period. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP financials can be seen on Slides 15 and 16. Now, turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, we ended Q3 with a strong balance sheet including $964 million in cash and investments up from $911 million at the end of Q2. Looking at Slide 11, the increase was primarily driven by the $57 million in cash generated from operations. This was our 35th consecutive quarter of generating cash from operations exclusive of one-time items. We also remained debt free. Free cash flow was $51 million in the third quarter 128% increment year-over-year. Our excellent cash flow generation was primarily due to strong billings linearity. We also had a higher investment in inventory in the third quarter of 2013 as we were then building inventory levels. Annualized inventory turns for Q3 were 2.3 above our goal to a better. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $500 million or up $100 million year-over-year and $20 million sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to consistent renewals in services attached to new product sales. We continue to build an impressive deferred revenue balance reflecting customer adoption of our suite of FortiGuard security services and FortiCare support which generate recurring subscription revenue and provide stickiness with our customers. Finally, during the third quarter we repurchased approximately 428,000 common shares for approximately $11 million. As of the end of September, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for a total of approximately $72 million at an average price of $20.24 under the $200 million stock repurchase program that we announced last December. Our Board of Directors recently extended the repurchase authorization of the remaining $128 million in the program through December 31, 2015. It was set to expire on December 31, 2014. I\u2019ll discuss guidance in a bit but first let me turn the call over to Ken, who will provide more color on the overall market, new product introductions and our competitive advantage. Ken Xie :  Thank you. Good afternoon. Q3 was a strong quarter for Fortinet across the board. We over achieved on several key finance metrics and again clearly show that our growth strategy and the investment are paying off. Increased high profile, high damage security breaches, coupled with a competitively superior product, solid sales execution and improved marketing awareness were key drivers for our exceptional results during the quarter. Our FortiASIC processor has been a game changer in the industry. And everybody knows they match enable security performance and the functionality for our FortiGate platform. We have seen a more high level of customer demand for our new FortiGate product integrating the FortiASIC NP6 which had lead to a number of sizable and impressive enterprise and service provider deals as Drew just discussed and we\u2019re only halfway through our refresh cycle of FortiGate system utilized the NP6 processor. So there is definitely more innovation and product to come, among them is our FortiGate 3810D the first and only security appliance with 100 gigabit port to make a stringent performance and a connected demand of the next-generation high-speed datacenters. Announced last week the FortiGate 3810D integrate our FortiASIC NP6 processor and extend performance past replace last year with the FortiGate 37D by succeeding it as the world\u2019s fastest security appliance and almost 300 gigabit per second through core. This tripled panicle speed of most other high-end appliance. The FortiGate 3810D redefined a limit of the datacenter cost security performance from large enterprise panicle call provider by being the only appliance to achieve mutlti-100 gigabit per second throughput and high-speed 100 gigabit port connectivity in low power compact footprint with other cost and complexity of a chassis-based solution. The FortiGate 3810D, along with the FortiGate 5000D, 3700D, 1500D, 500D and 300D appliance, position Fortinet very well in the firewall refresh opportunity as enterprise upgrade their datacenter and encompass network to a higher speed to support the initiative such as public and private cloud infrastructure, Internet 2.0, software-defined network, virtualization and mobile platforms. So in today\u2019s enterprise, the popularity of a mobile device and cloud-based application add extra security challenges, which makes the traditional way of security network border no longer sufficient. As a result, enterprises are evaluating their security infrastructure compared to protect against challenging cyber threats. In addition to integrating functionalities, we are increasingly deploy security beyond the parameter and deeper into the core by internal segmentation of the department application and the users for example deployment of firewall in transparent mode inside the company network to segregate finance, engineering, sales, our external partners, to protect critical information, while not disrupting the current IT compositions. This approach add additional layer of protection if attack make its way into one section of the internal network, it can be contend and won\u2019t comprise the entire network. It is important for internal firewalls as well as at same speed as the internal network and also that they can be deployed in non-disruptive transparent mode. With the FortiGate 3000 and 1000 series of high performance appliance, Fortinet can uniquely address the enterprise requirement for internal transparent firewall with a world best performance for each functions and a lower total cost of ownership. We have a strong advantage here and view this as a incremental opportunity for us in the enterprise market. But Fortinet is a technology-focused company. Our products sell, because of the technical superiority, not because the marketing hype that some of the competitor focus heavily at total loss about the importance of third-party testing and certification and whole value that is by customers. The security market is flattered with marketing noise, which can be confusing and make it harder to decide for the best product from the best marketed one. As we have seen from the numerous recent high profile attacks, security is a critical technology and if it fails to perform as advertised, the outcome could be serious. To help customer making clear judgment and purchase decisions a long belief that there should be a regulated system and testing process to certify that security product can actually do what vendors claim they can do, similar to the what FDA does in the medical industry. And by third-party test at the cost in we have to this as we along the public to see the skews and short comments of competing product test against each other under the real world\u2019s stringent conditions. As you can see on Slide 12, NSS Labs one of the industry most well respect independent third-party testing organization recently conducted a comparative test of enterprise next-generation of firewall, which got a lot of attention in the industry. I am pleased to say that both our recently announced FortiGate 1500D and our FortiGate 3600C enterprise datacenter next-generation firewall appliance, exceeded our benchmarks and earned recommended rating based on a superior security, stability, reliability, performance and a total cost of ownership. Additionally, as seen on the Slide 13 our surf rate NSS comparative test of enterprise-wide application firewall. Our FortiWeb 1000D appliances achieved one of the highest positions and also earned a recommended rating by affectively launching 99.85% of WAF attack and easily succeeding in all other benchmark tests. Testing truly does matters and it\u2019s helpful for customers, that\u2019s why we win in the majority of enterprise and service provider deals. Security trend changes and the company comes and goes they are share gaining and also who are growing today and also share donor who are decelerating Fortinet is clearly a gainer and we have every intention of continuing to grow in size and market share by placing high quality, solving customer problem with the best technology and innovation. We have an exciting product roadmap ahead and a clear course of action that I am confident about. With that let me now turn the call back to Drew to discuss our outlook of Q4 and the full year 2014. Drew Del Matto :  Thank you, Ken. And I want to finish with some commentary on our general outlook going forward, as well as provide some guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2014. Fortinet has a strong market opportunity and our strategy has been to invest, to capture market share and accelerate growth. Throughout 2014, our financial results and key sales metrics have shown that our strategy is working. Our growth has accelerated substantially specifically during the first nine months of 2014. Billings have increased 29% year-over-year compared to 11% during the same period in 2013. In addition, we are being invited into more RFPs winning significantly more high value large enterprise deals and have further differentiated ourselves from competitors on the product front. We believe in our strategy and as a result we plan to continue our strategy as we see similar growth opportunities due to our belief that it will yield additional returns over the long-term. That being said, we are not blinded by macro-headwinds that may occur and also realize balancing our ability to drive growth while showing operating leverage is important. We have the flexibility to adjust investments if and when it makes sense. With that as background, let me now provide specific guidance metrics for the remainder of 2014 starting with the fourth quarter which can be seen on Slide 14. As a reminder, all of the guidance constitutes forward-looking statements subject to Michelle's cautions at the start of this call. We expect billings to be in the range of $245 million to $250 million up approximately 18% year-over-year at the midpoint and representing growth of approximately 2 times market analyst forecasts from IDC and Gartner. It is important to note that our Q4 billings growth rate is not indicative of a deceleration of our business but due to a more difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of last year. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $206 million to $211 million also up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. Please recall that in addition to the more difficult comparison, last year\u2019s Q4 included a $2.2 million benefit related to the sale of a patent. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% to 71%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 16% reflecting continued investments to drive growth. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.14 per share based on an expected diluted share account in the range of $170 million to $172 million fully diluted shares. In terms of 2014 we are raising our full year estimates for billings and revenue. This updated forecast takes into account the over performance in Q3 as well as our increased expectations for Q4 driven by the ongoing benefits and increased sales capacity and improved marketing as well as the momentum of our differentiated solutions. As a result, we currently expect billings to be in the range of $859 million to $864 million up approximately 26% year-over-year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $752 million to $757 million up 23% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 71% which is at the top-end of our prior guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 16% again reflecting our continued growth investments but still within our prior guidance range. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.47 per share to $0.48 per share based on an expected diluted share account in the range of $169 million to $170 million fully diluted shares. We are in the early stages of our 2015 planning process and remain focused on growth with responsible investments. We plan to provide further details on our longer term outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in January. In closing, I'd like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator, you may start the Q&A. Question: and: Operator : Okay. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. So Gray, please go ahead. Gray Powell :  Great, thanks for taking the questions. I just had a couple of quick ones. So as obviously you had a very successful refresh on the high-end late last year with the 3700D and 1500D line. In early July you launched the 300 and 500 mid-range appliances or I guess yes, so how is market acceptance of that product has been and what\u2019s your expectation there for the next 6 to 12 months? Wells Fargo Securities :  Great, thanks for taking the questions. I just had a couple of quick ones. So as obviously you had a very successful refresh on the high-end late last year with the 3700D and 1500D line. In early July you launched the 300 and 500 mid-range appliances or I guess yes, so how is market acceptance of that product has been and what\u2019s your expectation there for the next 6 to 12 months? Ken Xie :  The 300D-500D we see a lot of response from market is much better performance compared to the old 300C-500C. So especially we see enterprise starting to deploy like I said inside their internal network to do the segmentation. So that\u2019s where 300-500 and also the Web sales are working firewall within enterprise to separate department, the server, the user it is a larger platform we see very growth there. Drew Del Matto :  Yes, we saw nice growth Gray we are not really because it\u2019s hard to give guidance at this point we think we will talk more about guidance next year but I think we were pretty happy with the products they really release kind of mid quarter in the U.S. I think in September end and Europe but we definitely saw some traction it is reflected in the product mix. Ken Xie :  Also, in end of July we also announced the FortiGate 5000 it is terabit firewall platform it\u2019s a lower hanging product it\u2019s probably the only one in the space can achieve healthier performance but not high-end units have a much longer sales cycle compared to the 300D-500D, so that\u2019s we see a lot of testing but it is still early in the process. Gray Powell : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful and then can you just talk about the traction you\u2019re seeing in the non-traditional or non-FortiGate appliance lines such as the FortiSandbox solution, I know you gave some statistics at the beginning but any color would be helpful? Wells Fargo Securities : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful and then can you just talk about the traction you\u2019re seeing in the non-traditional or non-FortiGate appliance lines such as the FortiSandbox solution, I know you gave some statistics at the beginning but any color would be helpful? Drew Del Matto :  Sure Gray, I mean we were very pleased with our advanced persistent threat solution. Again we feel that it compares favorably certainly to our competitors as it integrates with the firewall and we\u2019re able to do deep flow antimalware and antispam at the same time so, we feel like we have a competitive advantage and certainly I think the fact that we perform extremely well in the NSS Labs results has become a big selling feature for us and you could see that kind of reflected in the 3,000 customers that are now using the product. Ken Xie :  Another key factor while integrated is a FortiGate system. So a lot of existing customers, they lack the solution they kind of walk for guarded not only can detect other intrusion but also can prevent attack. So that solution combined with FortiGate sensing for the FortiAP and the FortiWeb also looking well together. Gray Powell : Excellent, thank you very much.  Wells Fargo Securities : Excellent, thank you very much. Ken Xie :  Thank you. Operator :  Okay, thank you. So our next question comes from Matthew Niknam from Goldman Sachs. So Matthew, please go ahead. Matthew Niknam :  Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. So, two from me; one, on margins, the guidance implies operating margins are flat sequentially next quarter despite seasonally being up about 200 basis points in recent years. So can you maybe talk about where you are may be expecting elevated expense pressure that are maybe kicking your margin expectations flat? And then secondly just on the competitive landscape in light of some of the success you have had with share gains I am wondering if you have seen any more aggressive activities from competitors in the wake of your success? Thanks. Goldman Sachs :  Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. So, two from me; one, on margins, the guidance implies operating margins are flat sequentially next quarter despite seasonally being up about 200 basis points in recent years. So can you maybe talk about where you are may be expecting elevated expense pressure that are maybe kicking your margin expectations flat? And then secondly just on the competitive landscape in light of some of the success you have had with share gains I am wondering if you have seen any more aggressive activities from competitors in the wake of your success? Thanks. Drew Del Matto :  Thanks Matthew, I\u2019ll start with the expense side. We are seeing success with our strategy right now. Our strategy is to gain share and monetize our customers over the long-term really to get the scope and scale benefits of margin over the long-term by acquiring customers today. So, we\u2019re going to continue that strategy and I think that explains why the margins are directed the way they are for next quarter. And your second question was again on\u2026 Ken Xie : Competitor. Drew Del Matto : Are we seeing competitive pressures? Ken Xie :  Yes, I can comment now is I have to deeper relation, deeper in vertical space it is maybe different. So in the high-end service provider on the datacenter side we see way ahead of competitor both on a product like we announced the 3810D 100 gig port and also the 5000 terabit firewall we\u2019re ahead of competitor already like we are shipping chassis platform 5000 for 10 years compares them above competitors just announced already this year. So we don\u2019t see they come close to what we have but also in this space a lot of provider evaluate wants the new solution for the mobile security especially the other the LTEs smarter need additional protocol they need also much bigger concurrent connection and also a supporting multiple like iTV for these things a lot of differences. So we\u2019re ahead of competitor, we participate a while it\u2019s a lot of testing going on right now. In enterprise we see, we starting gaining a lot of market share right now. It\u2019s also come from our performance and also improved in marketing sales execution there. One thing we found out, we have a huge advantage compared to competitors really secure inside enterprise which they call while do we call the segregation gateway of internal firewall of different name. Basically, traditionally, using the network switch to connect all the internal company and they have a board to use firewall to secure to outside. But now because the mobile device the auto call approach, they need to secure inside enterprise right now so that\u2019s where the FortiGate with the FortiASIC starting to replacing some of the traditional switch inside enterprise. So we see there is a huge opportunity because the performance, the cost, the functions really more important compared to the board of firewall security. So that\u2019s why we started to gain a lot of share. The newly launched middle range with NP6 has seen advantage there. I certainly have to say the competitors starting to falling apart and also with our system chip solutions, we are starting to see much more advantage, both on the cost and the performance and we have not seen much competition in the SMB space. Matthew Niknam : Okay, thank you. Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. So, Brent, please go ahead with your question. Brent Thill : Thanks. Andrew I had to go back in the model on the deferred revenue there to look way back on to see when you got the 25% growth in the DR. It\u2019s been a while. And I am just curious, is there any changing as when you look at that $0.5 billion that is sitting in DR in terms of the composition and the duration of that amount? UBS: Thanks. Andrew I had to go back in the model on the deferred revenue there to look way back on to see when you got the 25% growth in the DR. It\u2019s been a while. And I am just curious, is there any changing as when you look at that $0.5 billion that is sitting in DR in terms of the composition and the duration of that amount? Drew Del Matto : You\u2019re talking about I think you are asking if there is more multi-years in there. I don\u2019t think we haven\u2019t seen any real change in that profile Brent. And third question, I do think part of what creates some of that growth is really just the fact that we\u2019re focused on pricing on the support side of the equation. That\u2019s very important for us to hold that part of the equation. I mean obviously you want to hold it all around. But that\u2019s the gift that keeps on getting overtime and so we\u2019re very focused on that, is a good way to expand margin if you think about the calculus of land expand and then a lot of focus on the renew at a high price. Brent Thill : Okay. And just going to the DSO, I think you improved it by nine days year-over-year which would imply it wasn\u2019t a very backend loaded quarter and I think alluded to the linearity looked pretty strong in terms of linear. I am curious if you could just add a little more color in terms of what you saw throughout the quarter? UBS: Okay. And just going to the DSO, I think you improved it by nine days year-over-year which would imply it wasn\u2019t a very backend loaded quarter and I think alluded to the linearity looked pretty strong in terms of linear. I am curious if you could just add a little more color in terms of what you saw throughout the quarter? Drew Del Matto : Yes Q3 is an interesting quarter because you have a big vacation month in the middle. I think a lot of -- I think we were very focused on getting as much done as we can before people left for the beach so to speak. And we were successful in doing that. I also I think linearity come up on certainly the last call if not before. But it\u2019s been an improving trend overall. So I would say that continued. That being said, I think it\u2019s also a larger, if you look at it and compare it to Q2, there is a larger balance of I think support billings that actually happened during the quarter. And so those tend to be more linear in nature anyway. Brent Thill : Great, thank you.  UBS: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Melissa Gorham from Morgan Stanley. So Melissa, please go ahead. Melissa Gorham : Thanks for taking my question. I am calling in for Keith Weiss. So just a question on the service provider vertical either for Ken or for Drew, in previous quarters you\u2019ve talked about a return to normal spending patterns. Is that the case in 3Q does that kind of sustain? And I don\u2019t know if I missed it. But did you give the percent of billings from that vertical this quarter? Morgan Stanley : Thanks for taking my question. I am calling in for Keith Weiss. So just a question on the service provider vertical either for Ken or for Drew, in previous quarters you\u2019ve talked about a return to normal spending patterns. Is that the case in 3Q does that kind of sustain? And I don\u2019t know if I missed it. But did you give the percent of billings from that vertical this quarter? Ken Xie : I think we do gave 22% come from service provider. I think like I said first we are more diversified in the service provider globally and we also see like lot of service provider in the early stage try to evaluate how to do the mobile security LTE protection there. And so that\u2019s where with the new product we launched whether the new 5000D and also the 1700D, but we see a lot of our testing evaluation because kind of a new solution, new architecture. So that\u2019s a lot of thing going on. But we don\u2019t see some other companies these sort of segmenting in some area. We see kind of a quite exciting space as a lot of potential. Drew Del Matto : Yes, I think Melissa just to add on. Well again there is two dimensions to that vertical; one is the managed service provider piece. And that looks fine. I think as far as the internal networking part, that\u2019s where if there is any where it\u2019s a bit flattish so to speak, we probably be that side of the business. About two-thirds of our business with the carriers tends to be on the mSFP front. Melissa Gorham : Great, okay that\u2019s helpful. And then the strength in EMEA that was a little bit kind of intuitive given the macro data points that has been in that region. So I was wondering if you could just maybe provide some color on what you think is like the most important factor contributing to that, is it just improved product positioning is it just stronger secular demand in that region, better execution, just what\u2019s driving strength in EMEA? Morgan Stanley : Great, okay that\u2019s helpful. And then the strength in EMEA that was a little bit kind of intuitive given the macro data points that has been in that region. So I was wondering if you could just maybe provide some color on what you think is like the most important factor contributing to that, is it just improved product positioning is it just stronger secular demand in that region, better execution, just what\u2019s driving strength in EMEA? Drew Del Matto : I think we\u2019re doing a better job, I think our products are really hitting the mark on the enterprise space. Our investments in sales and marketing there have been very focused on enterprise. The people we\u2019re attracting have been people with deep enterprise experience. For example I think I mentioned this in the script for our billings more than doubled over last year in the UK and we brought in a new team over the last six months to nine months and they just executed extremely well, the products are good. And I think they are really finding a way to go-to-market and grow the business over there, and I do think we see that broadly across Europe as well. So amazingly enough given some of the economic headwinds in Eastern Europe it\u2019s almost counterintuitive but they have done a very nice job. And I think and a lot of it just goes really to having the right products, making the right investments and the right people and they are executing extremely well. Melissa Gorham :  That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Morgan Stanley :  That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turitz from Raymond James. So Michael, please go ahead. James Wesman :  Hey guys good afternoon it\u2019s James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Question for Ken and Drew. Obviously currency movements have been occurring a lot over the last couple of months. If I remember correctly you guys bill in dollars. But did you notice any effect on demand and I realized looking at the Q3 results. But were there any effects on demand in the quarter due to the U.S. dollar translation? Raymond James :  Hey guys good afternoon it\u2019s James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Question for Ken and Drew. Obviously currency movements have been occurring a lot over the last couple of months. If I remember correctly you guys bill in dollars. But did you notice any effect on demand and I realized looking at the Q3 results. But were there any effects on demand in the quarter due to the U.S. dollar translation? Drew Del Matto :  No there wasn\u2019t. As you said we bill in dollars which I think is a big piece of it. The partners tend to kind of we have a tight calendar could be favorable one and less favorable or going the other way another. They seem to be either be offsetting of the partners or just doing it pretty well. And again most of the headwind on the euro happened later in the quarter, quite frankly. James Wesman : And then Drew just a housekeeping question on next quarter. Any thoughts on CapEx I think you rattled of a $12 million number last quarter? Raymond James : And then Drew just a housekeeping question on next quarter. Any thoughts on CapEx I think you rattled of a $12 million number last quarter? Drew Del Matto :  For the rest of the year I said 12. James Wesman : I think for fourth quarter you said 12. Should we think about that\u2019s the next quarter? Raymond James : I think for fourth quarter you said 12. Should we think about that\u2019s the next quarter? Drew Del Matto :  7 million. James Wesman : For the next question, okay. Raymond James : For the next question, okay. Drew Del Matto :  Yes for Q4, 7 million for Q4, yes. James Wesman : Great, thank you guys. Raymond James : Great, thank you guys. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sir please go ahead. Sterling Auty :  Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Looking at the success that you have had over the last couple of quarters and in relation to the timing of the upgrade on the product line to the new chip, would you accredit any of the growth you have seen over the last couple of quarters to maybe pent up demand where looking back you say you know what customers were waiting for the upgrade? JPMorgan:  Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Looking at the success that you have had over the last couple of quarters and in relation to the timing of the upgrade on the product line to the new chip, would you accredit any of the growth you have seen over the last couple of quarters to maybe pent up demand where looking back you say you know what customers were waiting for the upgrade? Michelle Spolver :  No, Sterling it\u2019s Michelle. No, because I think going back even if you went through a year prior to now we still had very-very fast competitive solution that would meet their performance requirements. It really-really is about new customers' better sales execution and having a very strong competitive respect. I think it\u2019s probably a little bit less about that the new products than the sales execution. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then the follow-up to that, you mentioned both the refresh cycle which we would tend to think about existing customers but also customer expansion. How would you characterize the growth in billings coming from existing customers versus new customers? JPMorgan: Okay. And then the follow-up to that, you mentioned both the refresh cycle which we would tend to think about existing customers but also customer expansion. How would you characterize the growth in billings coming from existing customers versus new customers? Michelle Spolver :  Yes unfortunately. We don\u2019t have a staff there it\u2019s something we would like to have. But I mean we are seeing both. We gave some highlights of very large deals in six-seven figure deals that were brand new customers. So we are seeing both. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the breakdown percentagewise newer versus existing. We are seeing more business with new customers than we have in the past. Drew Del Matto :  Sterling, I would just add, I mean, again qualitatively more than getting into kind of exact detail on the quantitative side. We are clearly gaining share. So if the market is growing 7% to 9% or 7% to 8% and we are growing several multiples of that then clearly we are getting new customer wins which I think really kind of answers the question. There is obviously a basic customer, our 200,000 customers where we are being successful. But you know what new people coming on-board they bring new relationships. Our investments are very focused on acquiring new customers building scale in the company and that seems to be exactly where we are executing very well. Sterling Auty : Got it, thank you. JPMorgan: Got it, thank you. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Leone from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Paul Leone :  Excellent, thank you, I have a few questions. First one is about leverage. I went back to 2009 and every year with no exception your second half margin is better than the first half margin by a big margin or a big gap or a big jump in the second half margin. This year it\u2019s flat to actually down if I take your guidance as is. What is driving this year, lack of leverage? Because you are executing so well on revenues so what is driving this year\u2019s lack of leverage versus previous year\u2019s? And then without the specifics of the numbers but how should we forecast it going forward. Is this the new norm that the margins are kind of flattish throughout the year or is it going to go back to the normal seasonality if I can call it the better second half? Let\u2019s start to that and then I have questions about the business. Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Excellent, thank you, I have a few questions. First one is about leverage. I went back to 2009 and every year with no exception your second half margin is better than the first half margin by a big margin or a big gap or a big jump in the second half margin. This year it\u2019s flat to actually down if I take your guidance as is. What is driving this year, lack of leverage?

Let\u2019s start to that and then I have questions about the business. Drew Del Matto :  Look our focus is on gaining market share, which we are doing. And that really explains why we are different than and in 2010-2009. We have a different -- we\u2019ve change the ramp of the business or accelerated the growth in the business over the last year and that takes a bit of forward investment. Over time, as you build scale in terms of the number of customers that you acquire, you can broaden the scope of what you sold them with the scope of our product set or broad product set and that ultimately is how you expand margin in these customers. It costs more to acquire customers is what I\u2019m trying to say versus expand in a customer. We know the dials. We feel like [indiscernible]. We see the growth slowing down. So we have the opportunity to expand margin when needed but for now our profile is really to kind of continue to invest again and beyond that not giving -- we\u2019re going and giving get guidance out through Q4. So it would be difficult to get beyond that. Paul Leone - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  And what\u2019s the profile of the spend on your customers meaning, can you discuss what you\u2019re doing in terms of new relationships with distributors, resellers. How do you spend this extra money? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get, U.S. versus rest of the world as well as within existing regions, how is money spent differently? Ken Xie :  I think you can see Q3 we add 186 people and the majority in the sales and also marketing. So that\u2019s definitely added a lot of sales capacity but also they take some time to ramp up. So it would have taken a couple of quarters to sometimes even to a year that depend on a vertical space. And also we starting to invest more in the marketing -- more in U.S. marketing. We have a new marketing VP, Ian Ewan [ph]. She is also starting to ramp up the lot of a leading branding and also a lot of a marketing activity there. So that also would benefit us in the long term, I think all this international theories can give us market better position going forward, almost $1 billion cash on hand and receive a lot of cash flow I think - - last quarter it was about 51 million free cash in. So we feel keeping investing a growth will position the company better going forward. Drew Del Matto :  So and just to add a little bit there, again it\u2019s really people in marketing and so Ken talked about the people. We increased our sales capacity. We\u2019ve building actually or built an inside sales team and we also have some marketing people and then also in marketing we're really kind of doing messaging, events and lead generation if you will. And so that\u2019s really kind of where the spend is and then if you look at -- I think you asked a question about is it different as you across the globe and it is a bit different. If you think of the U.S. you can kind of go into five verticals and know where the bulk of the spending in the U.S. is -- financial services, healthcare, federal, et cetera. Then in going abroad, it gets a little bit different, where it become more challenge driven but I think developed world, it tends to be more vertical focused, for instance the UK is probably similar to U.S. in the sense there are clearly verticals there. I think the same and some of the big three countries in Europe. But then as you get into the more developing economies it just tends to be more channel driven as the verticals probably aren\u2019t as well defined and the market themselves are emerging. Paul Leone - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Got it, quick last question. This was asked many times on this call and maybe I can ask it again and get some clarification. We're trying to understand how much of this growth is cyclical versus how much of it is secular and how much of it is temporary and how much of it is sustainable? So that\u2019s why we all ask the same questions, as kind of around to understand how much of the growth, and I\u2019m not looking for a number, I\u2019m looking more for explanation. How much of the growth that you seen now is a result of new product cycle and if that\u2019s the case, then why would it sustain into the next few quarters and years? And then how much of the growth is the investment in the new sales that set efforts in marketing that you mentioned and how much of it is sustainable? So just even looking historically, how much of it is sales execution versus how much of it is product execution, if you can discuss it? Drew Del Matto :  Yes, I think it\u2019s a blend of those things, which probably doesn\u2019t help you break it down exactly like that but clearly, if we didn\u2019t have the people and the marketing investments on board, we wouldn\u2019t be experiencing this growth and I think that goes back to the earlier question of why margin -- our margin profile has changed from the past? But beginning of the year we clearly saw an opportunity to grow either not only with the new products but the security space, I know anybody on this call probably doesn\u2019t need to hear from me but it\u2019s obviously a hot space right now. So all those things I believe go together and we happen to have the right products at the right time but if we didn\u2019t have the messaging out there, if we didn\u2019t have the people, if we didn\u2019t have the channel reach, we wouldn\u2019t be as successful. And I think the best illustration of that quantitatively is just growing faster than the market as a whole and we\u2019re clearly growing at a multiple faster than the 7% to 9% in the Gartner and IDT. Ken Xie :  Although this - on the product cycle side I think it\u2019s -- we continue keeping investing in the innovation -- come up with new product and also new technology. So we are pretty much the only network security company. We invest both in the hardware ASIC level, the system level and sulfur level compared to most of competitor only have a sulfur engineer capability. So that\u2019s where we can see the benefit we got from the ASIC chip, whether the MP6 or within a [indiscernible] chip in the FortiASIC is network processor chip within MP6, which is half the high and middle range [indiscernible] by the chip. And we also have the ISO system on a chip which will address the SMB low end market and plus we have a quantum processor, pretty much all of FortiGate also leverage that. I think always chip probably, each generation take about two to three years to come up with chips. So we have all three chips. So we keeping going on -- keeping produce a better technology. At the same time we also leverage technology from the general purpose CPU, that other network processor, also the network chip like the 100 gig quad and also the other CPU, the technology that we have. So that\u2019s where we keeping refresh broad product line to address the total solution in the network security space. So I don\u2019t view particular chip or product to have a big impact but continue on the innovation and then on the new technology what drive us better and better, compared with the competitors. So that\u2019s where the few high end products lost. We\u2019re way ahead of competitors and starting refreshing more and also opened up the opportunities, whether in the service provider address mobile security or inside enterprise to secure the internal segregation solution. I think we see more opportunity because the technology we have and also the new product we have. But that thing will not stop. So every quarter you may see like a few new product come out, addressing different areas, more dependent on, is a continued innovation both on a chip level and the system level and also in the sulfur level. Drew Del Matto : Yes, and I would say that a couple other things just to point out. It\u2019s early in the product cycle of a variety of things. And just to show you kind of the mix of marketing, sales and product, think of APT, severe persistent threat. I think we mentioned we have 3,000 customers. It\u2019s hard to ignore the NSS test results from I think back in April or March where we performed very well and one of our competitors didn\u2019t perform as well. And getting that marketing message out there was very important to us, arming our sales people with that message. But ultimately I needed to have the sales capacity to kind of help them spread that word. And then I would also just add that look we\u2019re only -- we\u2019re nine months in really into kind of this investment cycle, maybe a year. And there still is I believe performance gains to come out of the people that have been onboard in the last six to nine months so to speak. And so I don\u2019t think it ends imminently. And we still continue to see opportunity. And if you look at the emerging products APT, one we pointed out, AWS was another, some of these projects; they\u2019re really just getting started. It is our hope anyway. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Jayson Noland - Robert Baird : Drew, are there any guidelines you would offer us for Cal 15 when it comes to growth rate or leverage? And it does seem like the 2x market growth rate is more realistic in Cal 15, given the compares get tougher? Drew Del Matto : Yes. I would just say this. We\u2019ll be glad to share discrete guidance in January for longer term guidance spend. But we continue to see investment opportunity for now. That being said, we\u2019re going to be very responsible, very focused on where we see maturing markets. And as you said, if the comps come into play but for right now, certainly the near term outlook is we feel good. Jayson Noland - Robert Baird : Okay. Question on gross margin, product gross margin ticked up again sequentially fourth quarter in a row; and I assume a fair bit of that is mix with some of these newer higher end deals and products. But could you talk about that mix versus pricing on the gross margin side? And what we should expect going forward? Drew Del Matto : I do believe it was last Q4 where we had the big -- it was the last -- Michelle, you may have to help me out of here. When was it? Michelle Spolver : When had the big\u2026? Drew Del Matto : We had a big retail deal. Michelle Spolver : We did, yes. So it was Q4 and also in Q1, we had two big retail deals which took product gross margins down a bit. They were large deals but they had a high concentration of low end devices. So a lot of times the mix of deals during the quarter will affect the gross margins. We saw bit of an uptick this quarter with 1% -- we had a 1% gain. Drew Del Matto : Yes. And I think when we look at these deals, Jayson, and maybe this is the way to answer the question. They do -- those deals do come up from time to time. And when you look out, what we\u2019re thinking about is the longer term opportunity that I referred to, making sure that we\u2019re building quite a long term profitability trying to fill that into a kind of a renewal if you will, as much as possible and broader expansion opportunity. So if you look at it from a strategic perspective, that\u2019s really how we try to evaluate the deals. Are we gaining share? Are we providing ourselves with the opportunity to expand margin over the long term and provide scale benefits to the Company? Jayson Noland - Robert Baird : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities : Congratulation. You said that the refresh cycle is about halfway done. Are you referring to the number of models that you've integrated the NP6 into? And if that\u2019s the case, can you give us a sense for what portion of your shipments and what portion of your revenues at this point would be associated with the NP6? Michelle Spolver :  So Erik, we're talking about it. Not every model will have it. Basically it's halfway through the FortiGate models that will have the NP6 processor in it. We're not giving out a number in terms of how much, because one is it does take some time to have those products ramp with our customer base and we are definitely seeing more of a contribution from the 3700D and the 1500D than we are, because those were announced a few quarters in advance of -- say it was announced in July. So it does take some time. What we did say I think last quarter with that and this quarter that the ramp up for those two products have been exceptionally high. So higher contribution than we would normally see from new products in that duration of time since introduced but we're not giving the actual percentage out. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities :  Do you typically see the old solution, the replacement predecessor product phase out and the transition to the new chip happen very rapidly or do you continue selling the older products for long as well? Michelle Spolver :  It\u2019s not all that rapid. I mean Ken, I don\u2019t know if you want to into this. It\u2019s not like we are cutting customers off and for a while we'll have those products so that there is a smoother transition. Ken Xie :  Yes, it take a couple of years to free sale our product. The way we naming a product, we try to keeping the same number and just different in the last letter. So is D replaced to C. So the customer can easily see how they can upgrade to the new product. A lot of customers, [indiscernible] these kind of products, the life cycle will only take about four years or five years. So if we are to have some old products, some consumer may keeping the employee the same product within their enterprise. So that\u2019s how far we keep supporting that. But also new product, just reported the most loss every 18 months 24 months, the speed doubled and also has more computing power there and also some more function and more strong how we interface. So that\u2019s one of the things we keep in doing in the last 14 years. I think -- let me say, this is already fifth generation. So this generation we tend to have a better chip and also leverage the better CPU technology, the networking technology. So it's the how we're keeping that better and better and the same time, the [indiscernible] also, when you have to take about three years four years to upgrade to a new version so that\u2019s where. And I will tell you if you see the halfway more to how we upgrade of FortiGate leveraged the new processor on FortiaSICs. From time to time we also upgrade the internal CPUs, the networking chip and some other things. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities :  Okay, are you seeing more of a shift to the non-FortiGate products that you talked about in the FortiSandbox and AWS. Do you think that the non-FortiGate products will exceed 10% at some time in the coming quarters? Drew Del Matto :  Look I think this is very early. It's interesting that because to actually figure that out, you're also kind of thinking about how the other products are going to grow, right? Because it\u2019s all relative right at the mix. But I think what we're seeing right now, we fell very good about versus what our original expectations. And so they seem to be growing very nicely. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities :  Has there been a shift in the contribution from the non-FortiGate products? Michelle Spolver :  Not materially. There is still a material to the overall portion of our revenue. So still less than 10%. Good traction on certain points which we highlighted, you may see in terms of if and when not becomes larger than 10%. But I think we did call out some of the products that we saw greater growth. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities :  Is Paul Walter the competitor that you see most for the internal Firewall? Is that the primary competition there? Ken Xie :  U.S. enterprise, we see Palo Alto also participating a bit. But under the region [indiscernible] and also other vertical space we not see them as a very strong competitor. Michelle Spolver :  Yes, the competitors we see across our business are still the same. So it\u2019s Junifer. We feel lot of Junifer, Check Point, Cisco and Palo Alto, especially in the enterprise in the U.S. Drew Del Matto :  Yes, I think if you look at our -- [indiscernible] read the script but I think that\u2019s pretty consistent with what we mentioned in the script. Those the name [indiscernible]. Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities :  Okay, then finally just on the service provider side. Is it still predominantly Junifer that you are competing against in that for that market? Michelle Spolver :  Junifer and Cisco. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Ives from FBR. Please go ahead. Daniel Ives - FBR:  Just one question. Are you seeing lot of these larger deals -- obviously a lot of success again this quarter starting to get fast tracked relative to where you thought it was 3 to 6 months ago, just given some of cyber securities issues happened across enterprise? Drew Del Matto :  I don\u2019t think so. I think, and I'm going to point you back to the census on our website. Because I think the way I read that and I think we even said this in the past, that you have kind of two things happening. One I think its, security becomes a priority. But I think the way most companies are going to look at it is it\u2019s such a critical priority in terms of brand that it probably gets a little bit of -- probably gets more scrutiny than it used to be. It gets pushed into the boardroom. You can pretty much be sure that in any Company doing much business online, that there is going to be board level scrutiny in review with those types of projects and so I think in one sense, clearly all the headline events drive demand and I think it puts a lot of focus on it and probably prioritizes these types of projects over other things. But then on the kind of headwind side, almost is the fact that it probably goes through more levels of review than normal. And so that being said, it's is to growing market and it\u2019s really kind of hard to predict how that goes, probably at the mid-level maybe a little faster. I think as you go up in terms of how technology focused or how much online they are, it'd probably go the other way. Operator :  Thank you and our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Northland. Sir, please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal - Northland :  Would you mind giving us a little bit of a sense of the mix of subscription versus support revenues inside the services bucket? Some of your peers talk about a bit of an upward bias on the group\u2019s margin line over time as the subscription portion of revenues gets larger and I\u2019m wondering to what extent we should be thinking about that as a driver for you? Drew Del Matto :  Yes, subscription is the greater percent of that number on our forward going side. Jeff Kvaal - Northland : Is it growing as a percentage of sales and if so, should we be thinking about that low 70\u2019s gross margin ticking up over time, Drew? Drew Del Matto :  The subscription fees growing as a percent of sales? Yes, it is. If you look at the differed balance I think that\u2019s a good indicator kind of the growth of differed because that\u2019s where most of it goes since it's recognized ratably. Jeff Kvaal - Northland : Yes. Drew Del Matto : If you look at that trend I think that would be helpful to think through that and again yes, I think as we build subscription -- as we build customers, we\u2019re very focused on subscription side as I mentioned earlier, not only in terms of attach rates but ensuring we get solid pricing there to monetize the customer over the long term. Jeff Kvaal - Northland : Okay, so we should be thinking theoretically although not specifically about \u201915 that over a multiyear time frame that there should be an upward bias to the gross margin level then or there maybe some other offsetting factors but I\u2019m not thinking about it. Drew Del Matto : There could be other factors. So I would just kind of stick to what we\u2019ve given for the rest of Q4 and we can talk about \u201915 in January. Jeff Kvaal - Northland : Okay and those other factors are essentially product mix or is there other pricing pressure that we haven\u2019t talked about? Michelle Spolver :  Yes, if you look at overall gross margins product mix is a big contributor to that. We gave a couple of examples of prior quarters where it effected overall gross margins because product gross margins are lower. So we\u2019re not forecasting -- we\u2019re not guiding to 2015. Product mix comes into play. So that would be one of the bigger factor. Operator :  Thank you and our next question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer:  Drew, you mentioned that the Company is halfway through its refresh cycle. From a timing perspective, when do you think Fortinet will be competing the current cycle, give or take? Ken Xie :  We mentioned we're halfway through refreshing some of the middle and high end FortiGate using NP6. So we feel it will probably take a few more quarters to finish the refresh but then we have other new chip will come out. So that\u2019s probably - will start again. So now that\u2019s where -- since the innovation the new technology coming to the product will continue driving the refresh of the product. So like every quarter, we have a few new product announced. So that's is the process we're keeping going forward. So I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s have a much impact of the number as - give us better competitive advantage but it\u2019s also the process continue going on. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer: Got it, thank you for that Ken. One more question. In your overall Americas revenue, what\u2019s the portion allocated to Latin America and how is performance in that region this quarter? Michelle Spolver :  We don\u2019t break out and report of revenue for sub-region. Obviously the biggest issue there for overall America's revenue is U.S. We talked about we had good performance across our business and across regions and that would include Latin America. Operator :  Okay, thank you and our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please go ahead. Jonathan Ho - William Blair :  Just one quick question from me. You talked about the nearly $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Any sort of new thoughts or anything you can share relative to your expectations around buyback or acquisition? Drew Del Matto : Jonathan, fair question, we really haven\u2019t changed our strategy there. Obviously we\u2019re always thinking about activities that make -- strategic opportunities that may make sense for us. I can\u2019t point out to anything really eminent on that front. And as I mentioned, I think we have $128 million left under the buyback. The board gave us another year on that. So we have $128 million left under that and really no change in approach there as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Zeller from Needham. So please go ahead Scott. Scott Zeller - Needham: I want to go back to an earlier comment in the call regarding service provider. And it sounded as if the management team was saying that the MSSP type business of service provider was doing well or fine and that the use by service provider for their internal use of these products was maybe not where you wanted it to be. Could you offer some more color on that? And what sort of competitive dynamic you have for the internal use case rather than MSSP? Michelle Spolver : Let me clarify in what Ken had said is that we are talking about the fact that other vendors have pointed to some softness in service provider. Those vendors don\u2019t have as much diversity in their service provider business as we do. And we\u2019re calling out that two thirds of our business -- approximately two thirds of the business that we do is service provider -- is for them to use our gear to deploy revenue generating managed security services. The other third is using our systems internal to the network. The competitive advantage that we have there, which is the last part of your question is the significant performance advantage that we have. It\u2019s obviously performance is very critical when you\u2019re running in very, very fast type carrier networks. That\u2019s our advantage there. We didn\u2019t necessarily say that wasn\u2019t performing as we liked. I think what we did is acknowledge that really when the service provider that have taken sort of and had it not been across our business, taking sort of a pause in purchasing would be because they\u2019re really looking at designing next generation future networks. It\u2019s a small portion of our overall service provider account base. So it\u2019s the first point that we\u2019re making. And that we do not see that across our service provider business. And we generally feel pretty much okay with that effect of the business. Ken Xie : On the technology side, I think the lot of technology, the service provider thinking we\u2019re not up still in the early stage, whether how to secure the LTE and also how the 100 gig and 40 gig of the high speed network interface deploying the service provider datacenters still in the early stage. The good news really we see a lot of tech is going on -- a lot of in the interstates and also we don\u2019t see our competitor even have the product come close. And we are only one who has a Terabyte firewall. We\u2019re only one who has the 100 gig -- 40 interface. And also [indiscernible]. So we see a lot of opportunities because some of the initial changes in the service provider before is really more secure out of fixed but obviously lot of the moment you like I mentioned, they need a much bigger number of session they need to support a lot of new protocol and also much higher speed and that all need some time for the service provider to test into redesign the architecture. So I think that it\u2019s a quite exciting space but into the early stage. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nandan Amladi from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst :  It\u2019s actually Tas [ph] on behalf of Nandan. I have two questions. One is you mentioned that you had a strong product refresh cycle this year. My question is when you have a product refresh, when you have a product for the new chip you also have a pricing uplift as part of the new product? Ken Xie : No, we tend to keep the same and that\u2019s where you can see the way we name the product and so it\u2019s the same name number, we tend to keep the same price. Unidentified Analyst : So why would a customer buy the older product then if you have the newer product with the faster chip at the same price? Ken Xie : See, the more slow every like a two years a speed battle. So that\u2019s where the profits power also double. So I think some customer I think if they already have some solution deployed using some of the product they brought few years ago and to sometime -- they just want to keep imply the same product, probably easier to manage and support the audiences [ph]. But technology keep advance. So that\u2019s where we also will not stop and wherever we see some new technology opportunities because we are only network secure company invest heavily, both in the chip level, in the system level, in the sulfur level. So that\u2019s where any technology advance in all this work [indiscernible] space. We just want to make sure we can integrate, we can also have the customer benefit from the technology. So that\u2019s where we\u2019ll continue to come up new products, which probably have better performance in the old product. But on the price side as on the margin side we want to keep pretty consistent. Unidentified Analyst : Is there a big change that the customer is required to make when he goes from say 3700C to 3700D or it\u2019s basically a plug and play when you upgrade your old appliance to the newer appliance? I am trying to understand why would a customer not buy a newer product with a newer chip at the same price if he's out in the market to buy a new Firewall. Why would you keep selling or why would customers keep buying your older kind of products. Michelle Spolver : What Ken was saying is that a brand new customer would probably buy the brand new product. What ends up happening when you have large multiphase enterprise deployments, it could be, it\u2019s not a big change or big disruption but they would have already tested the older version of the product? Its part of a multiphase rollout and it\u2019s already sort of been determined and that they would like to continue to go with the products that they purchased originally. So if it\u2019s an upgrade to a Firewall and they say okay we reached our -- the old product has reached an end of life. Of course they are going to buy a new product or if it\u2019s a brand new customer, many times they would buy a new product. But there any large any company doing business with large enterprises is that many times it\u2019s a multi-year rollout or multi-phase rollout where they want consistency in terms of using the same products that they originally purchased. Ken Xie : Sometimes also they try to match their infrastructure. So if they have a gigabit or 10 gig, they don\u2019t have to buy the 40 gig or 100 gig. And some time, a lot enterprise already put a 40 gig but 100 gig interface and that\u2019s where they probably more interested in a new product. I think like I said, after the new product announced it would take about couple of years to see the older ones phased out. So that was the process been going on for the last like 12 - 14 years. Unidentified Analyst : And then second question is you mentioned a lot of wins against FireEye on the call earlier. Can you talk a bit about how your product differentiates versus FireEye in terms of functionality? And then also can you talk a bit about your pricing of your APT product versus FireEye because FireEye is one of the premium priced products in that space. I think it\u2019s almost like a quarter million for a box. Can you talk about how your pricing for your APT product compares to the FireEye? Drew Del Matto : I think the easy way to think about it is first of all we have a firewall right. So we offer a broader, more integrated and higher performance APT protection because we can actually integrate with firewall. I think is the first point. A competitive advantage in integrating sandboxing with the firewall, flow based antimalware and anti-spam technologies to provide a unified comprehensive defense for advance persistent threats. I think the way customers think about it or what it really does is optimizes both the security effectiveness and network performance at the same time. And that was illustrated -- we keep pointing back to the NSS lab results back in March or April. But I think that\u2019s the highlight of that upper right quadrant if you will, if you\u2019re familiar with what I'm -- if you remember that, Tas. Yes, so I think that\u2019s the way to think about, kind of integrate it -- the sandboxing with the firewall, flow based antimalware and anti-spam technologies which provide unified comprehensive defense for APTs. Unidentified Analyst : So a customer has to be a FortiGate customer to buy -- it\u2019s not an independent product? It\u2019s a bundled add-on? Michelle Spolver : No, it\u2019s an independent -- we offer it in two different ways. So the FortiSandbox appliance, you do not need to be a Fortinet customer and the advantage of that, of being a Fortinet customer, because when you\u2019re integrating the firewall together with an APT device but if you don\u2019t you don\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s a standalone appliance. We also offer cloud based APT services that work with our FortiGate devices. So obviously need to be a Fortinet customer or buy the FortiGate device using the cloud based APT service. Operator : Okay, thank you. So we\u2019ll take our next question from [indiscernible] from Stifel. So please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Just one question here. Can you talk about the importance of the NSS lab results in terms of wining new business on the NGFW side of things? Thank you. Michelle Spolver : Well, the report only came out a couple of weeks ago. I think we feel good about it. We take obviously -- as Ken said we take testing very serious. NSS lab is a very respectable lab out there in terms of independent third party testing. We\u2019re excited about it. Obviously it helps us from a sales and marketing perspective but I think the test came out couple of weeks ago. Drew Del Matto : Yes I think took in the last month\u2026 Michelle Spolver : Yes, wouldn\u2019t have been a contribution to -- much of a contribution in Q3. Drew Del Matto : Yes, I think its helpful going forward. I would expect that to the extent there were deals in the pipeline I'm sure it didn\u2019t hurt. But probably really the -- it doesn\u2019t really I think sink into the calculus until the fourth quarter or so. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Drew Del Matto : Too early, yes. Operator : Okay, thank you. So that does conclude our Q&A for today. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Michelle for any closing remarks. Michelle Spolver : Thank you everybody. I know we went a little over here. So thanks for staying on the line. We have a follow up call. If there are any other follow up questions feel free to dial in at 3.30 and the calling information is within our press release issued today. And Ken, Drew and I will be here to take questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

With that let me now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Michelle and thanks to everyone joining the call today. I\u2019m very pleased with Fortinet\u2019s progress during the fourth quarter. We have very strong finish towards this year. The Q4 build in growth of 35% or more than three times of the market is the highest we have experienced in 16 quarters. During the quarter, we expand sales within our current customer base and acquired about 8,000 new customers adding to our large existing customer base, which includes a majority of Fortune Global 100. And we again were the member of last [indiscernible] service providers. So we are excited about this continued traction here because this high end customer provides better lifetime value and are beneficial to our business model overtime. Drew will talk further about this in a few minutes. On the product front, Fortinet continue to see strong adoption of our recently introduced FortiGate NP6 powered [indiscernible]. Also we continue to see traction of our FortiGuard APT subscription service and recently introduced FortiSandbox APT appliances. We win several APT deal against FireEye and Palo Alto including with a large garments service provider, a global plastic manufacturer and a U.S. based law firm. In all my year, in our security I have never seen the threat landscape more dangerous than it is now. On average, company are attacked 77 times per year. We find that 14 or 15 years ago because the cyber threat environment has changed and the new security was required. We integrate multifunction security vision change the way security is deployed and create an industry Fortinet have lack and since reception. Today, the threat environment has once again changed. We are in another security inflection point with company being enforced to make transformational decisions with respect of the network security infrastructure. In the past certain years, network security has been mostly focused on protection the network border, the point where the company connect with Internet. But today\u2019s highly security attack are finding ways to get the parameter defense and that being initiated inside the network by means such as smartphone, USB drive or already compromised laptop or other device marked into the company. Ones our parameter reach office, if the internal data is not protected it is on risk. Protecting in network inside out is necessary. The solution is to the point internal firewall for add to the layer of protection for key network resource in an event our parameter reach. Much like a lock from a store all are safe that\u2019s protecting the most important valuables, intrusion breaking to the whole. To deploy internal firewall, two big challenges exist, the first is performance. Internal network traffics are 10 to 100 times faster than the Internet traffic. So in order to be effective and accepted, internal network firewall must run in a very high speed also deployment must be quick and not disruptive, requiring no change to exist in policy and infrastructures. Fortinet address this requirement better than anyone in a high speed FortiASIC power FortiGate appliance. That delivered a fast performance provide protection of internal traffic and can be deployed anywhere in a network in transfer mode for easy deployment in a few second. We believe this internal multilayered protection market could be a big opportunity in the enterprise. And Fortinet\u2019s huge technical advantages position us well against competitors. We get provision to maintain the momentum as we enter the year with the best and most prudent security platform, which delivered industry\u2019s highest performance and skill like protecting and simplified IT infrastructure. This allow Fortinet to effectively defend so at both inside and at parameter to help our customer come back of dangers and changes at our secured environment. I feel confident in our strategy and opportunity. Our focus on constant dynamic technology innovation and security research has enabled us to quickly address the rapidly changing and hereby grow and you attend a large global based of highly subsequent customers. Both new customers and existing customers are key to our growth strategy focused on acquiring, cross selling, up selling and renewing. I\u2019ll now turn the call to Drew to discuss his strategy in more detail and along with the finance result for Q4 and beyond. Andrew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. Fortinet delivered a fantastic fourth quarter. We are a growth company and our results exceeded or met our expectations across all key operating metrics further demonstrating that our investment strategy is working. During the fourth quarter, our billings increased 35% year-over-year to $283 million significantly exceeding our guided range of $245 million to $250 million. Total revenue of $224 million was up 26$ year-over-year, also significantly above the high end of our guided range. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margins were 16% in line with our and reflective of our continued strategy to invest the growth. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.14 was at the high end of our guided range. And finally, our cash generation remained strong as evidenced by the $30 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter. Our strong top-line performance during the fourth quarter was a result of both a healthy security market and the ongoing success of our growth strategy as well as sales and marketing investments. Our investments are focused on strengthening our enterprise sales force including key vertical teams as well as increased marketing to improve our lead generation and sales productivity. These investments help lead to a new customer acquisitions and increase large deal activity. During the fourth quarter, our number of large deal ones again grew significantly. Deals over $100,000 grew 48% to 384. Deals over $250,000 grew 43% to 137 and deals over $500,000 grew 62% to 50. We also ones again had an increased number of deals over $1 million. Also our business with U.S. enterprise resellers showed another strong quarter of growth with 43% year-over-year. We are focused on the enterprise not only because it is a large and growing market where our superior performance - our superior product performance and functionality give us an increasing advantage over encumbrance but also because the average enterprise customer has a very high lifetime value for that. Enterprise customers like service providers are very sticky due to regulatory and compliance requirements and also out of more frequent target attacking, because more require than retain a customer and enterprise customers represent rich opportunities to up sell, cross sell and renew overtime. As can be seen on slide four, analysis of our top 100 customers in each region over a five year period shows that for every $1, the customer initially spend, they spend of average an additional $5 or more over the following five year period. This was significantly higher than what we see with an SMB customer. Given the accelerated rate which enterprises are making transformational decisions about their network security architecture, the strength of our third party certified platform and virtual and physical offering versus competitors and high return of acquiring these customers; we plan to continue our investment strategy for growth. Fortinet continues to leave the trend of convergence and integration of network security offerings. All of that provides us a strong competitive advantage and not only capturing new share opportunities but in displacing encumbrance. We believe the investments we are making today will help us in the future. This includes providing opportunity to increase profitability and deliver higher returns to our shareholders. Represented of the success we\u2019re seeing the strategy, during the fourth quarter, we acquired several new large enterprise customers from competitors where Fortinet Solutions were chosen as the core next generation firewall. Including that premier U.S. transportation company, a large U.S. retailer and a leading European financial services company, we competed against CheckPoint, Cisco, Juniper and Palo Alto in one due to our superior technology and performance. In addition to acquiring new customers, we also had success selling products to our large existing customer base, during Q4 beating our competitors. Specifically, we had several seven-figure up sell or expansion deals, where we were able to win new projects or expand prior deployments of our next generation firewalls. Among these deals, with a Fortune 20 technology company a leading U.S. software provider, a large U.S. federal agency and one of the largest Internet companies in Asia. In addition, we also won a six-figure firewall expansion deal with a leading U.S. wireless telecommunications company. We also had several cross sales deals, where we sold additional products, particularly FortiSandbox and FortiMail appliances to existing Fortinet customers. These deals are addition to the one Ken mentioned earlier and include a leader in U.S. transportation services, one of the largest Asia Pacific energy companies, a large Middle East aviation company and a large European government agency. The deals were won over FireEye, Cisco and McAfee due to our superior performance and our infrastructure integration ability with FortiSandbox for APT, FortiMail for e-mail security and the currently installed FortiGate next generation firewall products. And finally, we had many large subscription and support renewal deals with existing Fortinet customers. Our renewal rates which attract by appliances not customers remain in the mid-70% range that do not account for product refresh purchases. However, our customer retention rate is above 90% which is demonstrative above all customer satisfaction as well as the stickiness of our solutions. It also shows that we are not only winning numerous customers from exposed encumbrance we are keeping that. It\u2019s also worth noting that our history illustrates that are enterprise and service provider customers have highest retention rates. Now turning to some additional Q4 details. Our breakdown of billion across our top five verticals remained relatively consistent with service provider at 23%, government at 12%, financial services at a 11%, education at 6% and retail at 6%. Geographically, year-over-year billings growth was strong across all regions. America\u2019s billings grew 36%, EMEA billings grew 42% and APAC grew 19%. In regards to billings by product segment on slide five, we continue to see diversity of product billings across all segments. Our high end FortiGate products accounted for 40% of billing, a 10 point increase year-over-year and driven enterprise adoption of our high end appliance such as the FortiGate 1500D and 3700D. Our midrange enterprise products accounted for 25% of total product billing and our entry-level products accounted for 35%. As a reminder, our product billings mix varies quarter-to-quarter based on the models of products to makeup all size deals. As I mentioned earlier, total revenue with $224 million up 26% year-over-year and significantly above our guided range of $206 million to $211. On a geographic basis you can see on slide six and seven; the revenues continue to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. And the Americas revenues grew 23% to $91.6 million in price, 41% of total revenue. EMEA revenue were $85.2 million, up 43% and APAC revenues increased 9% to $47.2 million. Turning to non-GAAP expenses and profitability, during the fourth quarter, consolidated total non-GAAP gross profit margins were 72% which was slightly above our guidance. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 59% relatively consistent with last quarter, as we remained on focused on acquiring new customers for long-term value. Non-GAAP service gross margins were 84%, up from prior quarter and highlighting the value in our FortiGuard and FortiCare subscription offerings. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $123.5 million during the fourth quarter, resulting a non-GAAP operating income of $36.8 million or 16% of total revenue and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $24 million or $0.14 per share based on $171 million diluted shares outstand and at the high end of our guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35%. A reconsolidation of non-GAAP and GAAP financials can be seen on slide 14 through 17. As seen on slide 11, we ended Q4 with a strong balance sheet including $992 million in cash and investment, up from $964 million at the end of Q3. The increase was primarily drive by the $35 million in cash generation from operations. As I previously mentioned, the free cash flow was $30 million in the fourth quarter, were still strong the sequential decrease in cash flow reflects the variability of working capital, largely due to timing difference on collections rate relating to linearity and higher investment in inventory to support or growth. Annualized inventory returns for Q4 were 2.1 above our annualized goal of two or better. Our deferred revenue balance increased $559 million, up $126 million year-over-year and $59 million sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to consistent renewals and services attached to sales to new of existing customers. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we recur just approximately 214,000 common share for approximately $5.4 million. As of the end of December, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million share for a total of approximately $78 million at an average price of $20.52 under the $200 million store repurchase program that we announced in December of 2013. Before discussing forward guidance, let me wrap up by quickly running through some summary level financial results for the full year 2014 as show on slide 12. Billings for 2014 were $896 million, up 31% year-over-year or more than double the rate - the growth rate in 2013. Revenue for 2014 was $770 million, up 25% year-over-year. Differed revenue grew $126 million, up 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 71% and contributed to non-GAAP operating income of $122 million or 16% from revenue. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.48 for the year based on 169 million shares. Now, let me finish with some commentary on our general outlook going forward as well as provide some guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2015. As a reminder, our forward-statements including all of the guidance provided are subject to materials cautions at the start of the call. Fortinet has a strong market opportunity and proven best-in-class offerings. Our strategy in 2014 was to invest to capture market share especially in the enterprise and accelerate growth. Throughout the year, we showed that the strategy worked. Our full year billings growth of 31% was more than double that of 2013 and more than 3X the overall market growth rate from Gartner and IDC. Our investments are paying off and we see more share gain opportunity ahead of the hidden risk environment tries enterprises to make transformational decisions regarding their network security architectures. This creates an opportunity for Fortinet, we see every indication that the trends favoring best-of-breed integrated security solutions like Fortinet will continue. This creates opportunity to us to not only capture market share from growth in the market, but displace encounter as company\u2019s focus on the theme Ken and I noted. Thus we think we would be remiss not to continue our investment strategy and capitalize on this opportunity to capture more share of the high return enterprise market. We believe the opportunity for return on investment sales and marketing remain high for Fortinet. For all the reasons we\u2019ve discussed, we expect that today\u2019s investments will help fuel our longer term growth and profitability. We believe that the higher lifetime value of our increasing enterprise and service provider base driven by acquire, expand and renew strategy will result in addition growth and operating margin leveraged overtime. That being said, we are not lined by potential headwind that may occur and we have the flexibility in our model to adjust this and when it makes sense. The bank background; let me now provide specific guidance for the full year 2015 as well as the first quarter which can be seen on slide 13. Regarding 2015 wireless, it is still early in the year, we currently expect billing to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.80 billion, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We believe this guidance reflects our confidence for a strong year given the overall high work rates delivered throughout 2014 and the challenging year-over-year comparison that we state in 2015. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $915 million to $925 million also up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margins is expected to be in the range of 70% to 71%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 14% reflecting our continued growth investments as well as our absorption of cost of new hires in 2014. The majority of this investment will be focused on further building our enterprise vertical sales and marketing capabilities. Our investment strategy paid off during 2014 and we believe that continued investment will result in long term growth and future operating margin leverage. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.49 per share to $0.50 per share based on an expected diluted share count in the range 173 million to 175 million fully diluted shares. Now turning to the first quarter of 2015, we expect billings to be in the range $226 million to $230 million, up approximately 22% year-over-year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $200 million [Technical Difficulty] we need to continue to invest in building the foundation for our future. We are committed to investing strategically and responsibly and expect to see margin leverage ramp in 2017. We plan to continue to provide further details on our longer term outlook in subsequent earnings calls. So in closing, I\u2019d like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and our shareholder for their continued confidence and support. With that Ken, Michelle and I will now take your question. Operator, you may start the Q&A. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Niknam from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Matthew, please go ahead. Matthew Niknam - Goldman Sachs : Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Drew, just a follow-up on the margin commentary, so 1Q margin is obviously, guidance were half of what they were a year ago, guiding a little more margin compression in \u201915 despite great scale and maybe a little more operating leverage of some of the recent sales and marketing investment. So maybe if you can talk a little bit more about where you might see some elevated expense pressure incremental in \u201915 relative to \u201914 and then maybe why you think 2017 is the year where you begin to sort of inflect little more positively? Thanks. Andrew Del Matto : Yeah, fair question Matthew. So we did quite bit of hiring towards the end of 204 and we\u2019re just seeing a lot of interest from a lot of very experienced excellent people quite frankly who are knocking on our door to join the company. And so you know we had the opportunity to hire some key leaders in our vertical space then financial services, healthcare, federal and cloud and they had people follow them. And so you know you really kind of step the decision, you kind of care those people in or do you just bring them in and get them ramped up and that\u2019s what we saw and that\u2019s a little bit of - that\u2019s really baked into the guidance for next year and trying to giving us a little room until 2017, because we are seeing a lot of interest. If you look at this market, you know the overall trend, there is huge tailwind here on security. This is the lot of interest. People really are buying products, it\u2019s not really would you like some security with your network gear, it\u2019s just not that anymore, securities now the problem dimension the people are focusing on, you know we have best-of-breed technology that sells really well. That when enforced by the people coming in, they like that story, they believe that\u2019s the great opportunity for them to sell and quite honestly make money. So that\u2019s how - that\u2019s really how that is playing out. Also there was marketing team built that will continue to play out. And you know we\u2019re just you know we can\u2019t exactly predict when we\u2019ll see the exact benefits of that because these are really focused order enterprises, middle order enterprise, the cycle times of those are little less predictable and so we\u2019re giving ourselves a little room and just being prudent with shareholders quite frankly. You know but I would remind you that you know we really are committed to longer term growth, again remind people also that our spend is clearly on the sales and marketing line, we\u2019re scaling G&A and R&D there is - we are up building out a big ramp there or anything like that. So you know we\u2019re very focused on enterprise, building up the verticals and building marking effectively. Matthew Niknam : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Keith, please go ahead. Melissa Gorham : Hi, this is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. Thanks for taking my question. Question for either Ken or Drew, just on email, the strength of email was very impressive this quarter which seems little bit you know maybe countering to that just given the macro deal points that we\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe provide some color in what you\u2019re seeing in that region, is it improved product positioning or perhaps better execution you know better sales capacity or just any color on what\u2019s driving that strength would be helpful? Andrew Del Matto : Sure, Melissa. We think about it is you know there is - obviously the security tailwind right but I think your question is, will that - that\u2019s global, especially given the economic condition. The products again we\u2019re focused on the enterprise 3700D, 1500D are doing very well in the enterprise space, that\u2019s the first thing. The second thing is a little bit of what I just said to Matthew, it\u2019s about the people. We had a couple of leaders come in early in the year and they\u2019ve done very well in putting a new team in place. It\u2019s really have a new team in place, they knows the space, they knows the customers and really see the great opportunity to make money and they\u2019ve been performing very well. And so I really have to strike it up the execution. The marketing there is also been that very good. I think they expect lively, very focused on regeneration and work extremely well with the team. And so it\u2019s really a model that we\u2019re ambulating globally and really that\u2019s what putting the wind in our sales for the continued investment as we look out to 2015. Ken Xie : Melissa, this is Ken. The other point I want to add is what the investment we made in some other technology product NP6 and also as I mentioned the space send into more protect both inside and outside, I mean protect their internal network that\u2019s giving us huge advantage we have which is a FortiASIC based high speed performance gateway internally compared with the way they secured a border in the last 20 years. So that\u2019s give us huge advantage over competitor and also huge opportunity going forward. Melissa Gorham : Okay, great, thank you. And then I am just - one really quick question. You mentioned some contraction with the FortiSandbox appliance, I am wonder if that starting to have a material contribution to revenue and then how we should think about that ramping into next year? Andrew Del Matto : See, I think the way to think about it is I think most people there is kind of the FortiSandbox and then is the virtual offering. Lot of people really are buying the integration story in terms of the bundle. And so you know it is - it\u2019s not a huge number relative to the overall number of Fortinet, but if you think about how at least the sale of other product in the integration story that\u2019s really where the value is. You know people are buying that you know and integrates well. Technology, security technology is obviously converging on the network devices. Ken Xie : I agree with - that was true, the key word is only the protection because all solution not only put a detection but also working with FortiGate really protect - the customer protect the data, so that\u2019s different in some other company, we can only detect not really take action to protect. So that\u2019s protection, the total solutions actually attract lot of customer to us. Melissa Gorham : Okay, great, thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. Drew, just on the operating margin, you have to go back in the model five years to go back to time where your margins were at 14% and in 2010 and \u201911 you were putting up 30% growth with mid - above to mid-20% operating margin. So I guess the question is you know why do you feel like you have to go that low especially going below what you did in the last fiscal year on the margin, what kind of gives you that kind of confidence to go that the sustainability of this investment to yield the top line? Andrew Del Matto : Sure, Brent. I think we\u2019ve seen in 2014 that our investments are paying off you know the focus on really acquiring customers and driving value over the time is our strategic approach. We see a unique opportunity to capture share at this point. The market - the security market is in a transformational state right now, people want to us breed. We have that. And that really as reinforced by the people we see interested in joining company. We\u2019re doing that strategically, it\u2019s also reinforced by the people coming in. And so we just think it\u2019s a very good from our perspective and we think it paid also and we just have some more work to do which is really the drag on the margin if you will for the next year. Ken Xie : Also yes, there is a sometime delay compared to when you get sales on board and also when they can close the deal. We can see during 2010, \u201911, \u201912 the hiring sale people or the sales capacity is the half compared to the top line growth. So that eventually we can\u2019t [Technical Difficulty] Brent Thill : [Technical Difficulty] is across the board, I mean that you move shifted toward sales and marketing, more toward here or both? Andrew Del Matto : So it\u2019s sales and marketing. Ken Xie : Its most, but R&D also sometime need to see more long term investment that investing [indiscernible] ASIC level sometime it may take like a five year to see the return. Michelle Spolver : Yeah, that\u2019s not over, our R&D investment I think it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing historically. I think really where the change and it\u2019s with over and above with what we\u2019ve been doing early on and the additional investment in sales and marketing. Andrew Del Matto : Yeah, it\u2019s what I said to Matthew earlier basically with the investments on sales. As a percent of revenue, the investments are on the sales and marketing side, R&D and G&A really scaling 50%. Brent Thill : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Okay, thank you and our next question is from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Sterling, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Ken [ph] is for Sterling. One question, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what the impact of growth would be if you would actually taper off that investment those marketing? Andrew Del Matto : Sure Ken. I mean the way we think about it is I mean you could - to be fair; you could grow probably without significantly increasing sales and marketing. I think the reality of it is the value really is acquiring market share at this point in time. Again it\u2019s a transformational stage, it\u2019s a unique opportunity for best-of-breed security companies to focus on security and provide it, you just you know selling a little bit of security with your network here just really doesn\u2019t play anymore. The relations are open for us to grab, that\u2019s what they are doing. We think that\u2019s a great investment, because overtime there is high CLV which is what I was getting into - that\u2019s what I was talking in the call where we see a higher CLV obviously in the enterprise space than you could see in the SMB space. So this is a bit of a transformation for us, we are about way through it. Michelle Spolver : Yeah, that\u2019s actually after than two, you know could we grow in this environment? Yes. Could we grow twice as fast as what we grew last year, probably not, our growth doubled year-over-year. The other thing is to as we talked about in our commentary is that really the investments we are making today are really to help us in the future, not necessarily just today\u2019s environment that to grab with the right customer that bring very healthy lifetime value that will help us you know four or five years out. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. And I was also wondering if you could give us sense for what cash flow might look like give this trajectory? Andrew Del Matto : Yeah, we don\u2019t really got on cash flow that I can give you couple of the key items if you will. So for FY \u201915 for CapEx, we expect 40 million to 45 million and for tax somebody always asking the cash tax rates, I\u2019ll just kind of give you a range of 20 million to 30 million. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Andrew Del Matto : You\u2019re welcome, Ken. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Walter Prichard from Citi. Mr. Walter, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, this is Jim, actually I am for Walter. Thanks for the question. The past few quarters, you guys have shown a great improvement in DSOs, what drove your DSOs higher, was it just larger customers for DSO? Andrew Del Matto : No, you know the - really it was linearity, it\u2019s really just linearity. And what happened was the quarter wasn\u2019t back unloaded in terms of like being last couple of weeks. But really the last part of November and the early parts of December was where the deals are seeing, you know quite a bit of deals came in. And in the prior couple of quarter, we\u2019ve seen a smoother linearity ramp if you will, but that\u2019s really, there is no other story there, it was not a - certainly wasn\u2019t a preliminary type of quarter anything like that. It was I would call kind of smooth along the way and very nice in the last couple of weeks kind of pre-Christmas part of business. Unidentified Analyst : Gotcha, thanks Drew. Can you also talk about how many solutions per customer you have as well as any commentary you can provide on sales productivity on here? Andrew Del Matto : So let me take the last one first. On sales productivity, I would say people are doing very well, people are performing generally at or better than expectation. There is at least - there will be at least the dull curve on that statement let\u2019s say, so we\u2019re seeing a nice - we really are seeing nice productivity goes back to my only comments I think people see very prudent opportunity in the space that is sales people are not only here but coming into the company. That is better as they get more tenure, there is a high coloration to entranced relationship and develop relationships in security to higher performance. In terms of the overall products, you know we do see interest in people really kind of buying the bundle if you will and that you can look at the billing and revenue slightly than billing is not part of the explanation, you know it\u2019s going to differed revenue, because obviously there is a higher percentage of people buying the virtual offerings and subscription based services and technology. Ken Xie : Yeah, also we offer quite broad product, so that\u2019s where the up sale, cross sale opportunities also very big. That\u2019s where fully scheduling at the leading a lot of the deal and then customers they didn\u2019t see the Sandbox in, see the FortiWeb, FortiMail, some other solution that they needed. And so that\u2019s also like I mentioned early, how to secure your internal secure the datacenter to server, they use sort of the common, so deploy inside the company, we also see a lot of opportunity this way. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Operator : Okay, so we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Kvaal from Northland. So Jeff, please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Yes, thank you very much. Another question - another clarification, the clarification might be easiest, did you say that the long terms operating margin target that was 20% or 25%? Andrew Del Matto : 20 Jeff Kvaal : 20, okay. Got it. Then the long term question is, I am little concerned that the market is getting a bit more competitive, the OpEx here we\u2019ve discussed, did it sound like the gross margin is down a little bit, we talk little bit about DSO, some of these things are not things that some of your other firewall competitors you think too much in the market, but - and so where is going to little bit more for me to get that incremental market share, my overstating things, how many things are true? Andrew Del Matto : Well you certainly welcome to your own, the way we see it, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s true, I think when you are talking gross margin, we\u2019ve been trend there. Again you know we see a high value in acquiring customers and retaining them. We have a very customer retention rate, if you look across our more than 200,000 customers it\u2019s a very high 90% plus retention rate. There is a lot of value in acquiring customers and monetizing them overtime. That\u2019s quite a bit of the strategy. We also, I think it\u2019s very that the market is a very good fertile opportunity for us and that\u2019s really where a lot of the growth we think have come from and will continue to come from given a best-of-breed products in our story around the ability to convert security technology on a network devices. So that\u2019s really at and keep in mind also the markets growing according to ITC you know somewhere between 7% to 10% Ken Xie : The other orders seems only to the model really when we grow faster, you can see the percentage of the product revenue little bit bigger compared to like little slow growth with the service that come up better. So we have a model, the product revenue tend to growth 60% and the service revenue tend to grow like little over 80%. So that\u2019s when the product revenue growth faster, which is also the leading indicator for future service that tend to have a margin little bit. Andrew Del Matto : That\u2019s right and you also to point - you have higher commissions along the way which there is another way to kind of get into sales productivity not we talked about 70 but I think it\u2019s other way actually a higher commission expense in Q4 as people are performing very well. DSO, I would say Jeff that I don\u2019t think the DSO had anything to do with the market going forward. Again I - you know it\u2019s really talk in the first couple of weeks in December, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s have no long. Jeff Kvaal : Okay, and then finally you gave yourself, something you said you gave yourself a little bit of room and guidance on the develop line to OpEx line in particular or with across the board? Ken Xie : No, I think my reference was to I think someone asked me the question about why the margin in 2015 and what do we see going forward. And that was really about the ability to make key hires where in the right people become available. Just over the last year is that the people make a very big difference. We really see saving a productivity out of new people with experience you know experience in this market with customer growing after and the ability to sale. So we are seeing - now that\u2019s what we\u2019re really doing and then the good people follow them in groups. And so it\u2019s not a tired ramp, it\u2019s people with a smooth ramp, they tend to come in bunched. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you and our next question comes from Jayson Nolan from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead Jayson. Jayson Nolan : Thank you. Congrats on the quarter and just a follow-up on the sales and marketing expense Drew, it\u2019s \u2013you think this is mostly a head count as opposed to channel incentives or advertising? Andrew Del Matto : Not absolutely, now what we do is, we have been building a lead gen-engine, but I would even point to that we had talked about the year, I think that\u2019s one of the things I said is building out a lead gen and then you go to multiple assets, is a bit transformation and that takes time and submit you probably get it right, you get all the handouts right, to get metrics right and to kind of see where the best-of-breed come from. And I would say that we\u2019re actually starting to see the front end of that, that feels like really like going forward I mean almost back. Jeff\u2019s question, do you think the indicators are something softening or lack. In fact I would say it\u2019s the converse is true. What we\u2019re actually seeing is improvement in the overall lead generation and the qualification that believes the quality, it believes if you will the way we measure that. And we are actually getting a good beat onwards as they are coming from and being able to kind of narrow and focus on I think even kind of improved and investment profile there. Again you need to get yourself a little time to build that exactly right and make sure you know you got your meshing down correctly for your business, but we see very good results on that. Jayson Nolan : On the FX side, could you confirm that you price mostly in U.S. dollars around the world and have you seen any headwind or expect to see any headwind there? Andrew Del Matto : You know, we do price in U.S. dollars, have you seen any headwind, the answer is probably not, you now certain not incur to us, I am sure there is little bit of discounting here and there. I don\u2019t think anything abnormal. It has come up, you know will be a headwind, you know I think that really depends on how to fill the gaps but we haven\u2019t seen a lot of that, what we really tell people is that our margin agreements address some variability in FX I mean you know people are getting this back money or margin when the euro was at $1.45 or $1.50 and we remind him that when it\u2019s closer to $1.10. Also the - you know the focus on security is very high and so there is a bit of pricing leverage in the market. That been said you know just really hard to predict what will happen going forward. Jayson Nolan : Understood. Andrew Del Matto : And we do remind people what goes up, goes down and vice versa by the way. Jayson Nolan : Thanks a lot. Operator : Okay, thank you and our next question comes from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. Gray Powell : Great, thanks for taking the question. Just a couple with - if I may. So obviously we\u2019ve had a very positive spinning environment 2014, how sustainable do you think it is and in directionally, do you think that broader network security spinning growth in 2015 can neither exceed the PC soft in 2014? Andrew Del Matto : Well, if you are asking the question about the market as a whole, I think we would have to try to pull it back the IDC Gartner numbers which I believe are high single digits, maybe 10%. You know obviously we\u2019ve given the guidance, we upgrade, so we wanted to really get off of that. You know I think the answer is more qualitative about we do see opportunity out there generally beyond just market growth, you know give the best-of-breed technology and our story of that convergence of security products on IT and sell security for us versus kind of network plus security and then add on. And that\u2019s really how we resonate in the market and you know if you think about all the security issues out there, I am sure if it\u2019s only a problem in that thinking about your network here right now, you are thinking about securities and that\u2019s what we leave it. Gray Powell : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe I know lots of the conversation been focused what was the enterprise, but there is maybe a question on the SMB side of your business. How did you view the competitive environment there, last quarter I think you stated that you\u2019ve been seeing some weakness from your competitors, so has anything change there and so how should we think about growth in that segment versus rest of the business? Andrew Del Matto : Well I think we gave a number for channels growth of - yeah. Michelle Spolver : I mean I would say, we\u2019ll see any change and I think that we can change in the SMP part of our business, I mean it\u2019s a very well run part of the business you know driven by the channel very easy I think to be running with the strong advantage there, so nothing really changing there. Gray Powell : Okay, thank a lot. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Jonathan, please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Hey guys congratulations on the strong quarter. Just wanted to start out with a quick question on the OpEx side of things, in terms of currency, I just wanted to understand sort of the dynamics there and whether the OpEx side would maybe benefit from currency and how that sort of factors into the \u201914 guidance? Andrew Del Matto : Well, it\u2019s - I mean there is a bit of a benefit, we do have some quite a few has in Canada and some in Europe obviously, so we\u2019ll see that benefit. But we have factors in the guidance. Jonathan Ho : Got it and then just in terms of the broader traction that you are seeing in the enterprise city like do you feel like putting at this point is being invited to many of the big causes that are taking place or just still relatively early stage. I am just trying to get a sense from you in terms of the traction that you\u2019ve gotten particularly with the reseller channels and the ability to get invited to many of the bigger competitions that are taking place? Andrew Del Matto : Great question Jonathan. I think we\u2019re certainly getting valid more .What I can absolutely say is you know without the investments we\u2019re making, we probably - we would be hard to make that statement. I think it\u2019s - we no longer here, we just have part of conference and what I heard time and time and time again from the partner well that\u2019s no longer reported who. And really the ability to focus on them given the tools and training that they need on the products and give them the sales - help them with sales coverage and marketing and leads is a key factor and getting to the table. So you know I guess somebody answered the question is we\u2019re getting it more, do we get in mall, I don\u2019t know. You know hopefully we are getting more and more as we go forward that\u2019s the idea. Ken Xie : You know Jonathan, also it depend on vertical, some vertical we probably have better market share like in education and some of the retail, some other vertical is letting more Greenfield which we - and we started build up, some great sales was there, so that\u2019s also we mentioned lot of our existing customer we seen special big enterprise that the initial buying it\u2019s the long term, it about five years of the initial buying. So that\u2019s also having to the existing customer base and up sell, cross sell, also we see a lot of opportunity, that\u2019s which also need a lot of sales coverage. So that\u2019s we see a lot of potential. Also we mentioned like a multilayer security, securable in the broader and the inside also has a huge opportunity for us. Jonathan Ho : Got it and just one final clarification, when you guys talk about sort of the dynamic with greater lifetime value with the enterprise that you are pursuing, is that sort of one of the major factors that ways into your decisions to justify making the investments now just from the perspective that maybe as you win these customers overtime you\u2019ll just see a significant pickup once you can land and expand within those organization? Andrew Del Matto : Jonathan, it absolutely is, you know Ken to talk about the strategy of the ability to our products are expand the products that to create that full opportunity overtime. But before you guys ask everything, I would point out that we have a very high customer rectification right that I also mentioned really which is 90% plus. When you think about those factors and getting some tenure sales people in those accounts, we provided, we think it\u2019s a very good chemistry to provide very nice returns overtime. Ken Xie : Yeah Jonathan, that\u2019s a few parameter we started add in to measure effectiveness and also performance is really the customer attention. In the past, we only measured a renew rate which only measure only effectiveness and also performance, is really the customer attention. In the past, we only measured a renewal rate which only measure per box renewal, now the retention we\u2019d also helping to see even the customer base on new box, customer is a retention rate but not in a renewal. The other parts really the long term value of the customer from the initial buying tracking for few years than how much keeping buy in the next few years. So that\u2019s the new measurement we see a huge value. Jonathan Ho : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP. So Erik, please go ahead. Erik Suppiger : Yeah, congratulations on a very good quarter. First off just curious, you talked about the internal market opportunity, was that much of a factor in the December quarter and how big you think that market could be relative to the parameter market? Ken Xie : I in the last few quarter you see a lot of news, company do have the firewall and another security device project even the connection new cut in pushed inside, so that\u2019s we see a lot of feedback from customer, now they need to protect their server, their important data inside the company, so that we see a lot of opportunity and this combines with a new FortiASIC NP6 based appliance which has high speed. We see huge protect and also demand for this one. I think still in an early stage because the market we need to educate it about multilayer security internal compared to test security parameter, but it\u2019s a new opportunity but we see a huge potential and a lot of customer were interest in this. Like I mention, there is two key challenge here, one is the internal speed 10 to 100 times faster than the way the connect to the internet. So the - I mean the security gateway has to be fast enough to match the speed of internal switching device. The second deployment has to be more quick easy not intrusive and they don\u2019t change any policy on infrastructure which need to dropping within in a few second in the transparent mode. So these tools are key advantage compared to competitor and that we see the huge potential in the - for this new approach. Erik Suppiger : Okay and then do you - you just on the margin, on the operating margin front, can you give us a little sense for kind of the pattern you would expect from operating margins in 2015, if you are staring at seven and it\u2019s going to 14 for the year, is it going to a liner progression upwards or is it kind of take a stair step from Q1 to Q2? Andrew Del Matto : Yeah Erik, kind of hard to deal with this point. You know I get back, obviously there have to have margin, you are going to probably exit year are harder that we start in the year, I\u2019ll give you that. That\u2019s mathematically that has to work to get to 14 from seven. But why is that whole to know, if experiences taught us anything that given ourselves the opportunity to get the right people in the door and you know if they bring people in with him, it just - it can spending early or late. And so I think it\u2019s really hard to get people too - you know be - wouldn\u2019t be good idea to get people too focused on that as kind of pursue that opportunity. But we\u2019re pretty selective on afford a culture I you will and who is a good set. You know we look for certain type of person and you know when they are available, they tend to have people follow them. That way on - about that\u2019s really some of the - some of spot there and just being a little careful on trying to provide a ramp through the year. Erik Suppiger : Let me ask you just, would you expect end the year significantly about 14%? Michelle Spolver : The entire year or in Q4? Erik Suppiger : Q4. Michelle Spolver : I think unfortunately we can\u2019t, we are not providing guidance on a quarterly basis, I mean as Drew had mentioned, obviously we need to increase for the year by may not be stair stepping perfectly each quarter the next. Erik Suppiger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Hi, good afternoon guys and congrats on strong set of numbers. Drew, probably a little bit of the long terms question is you started providing some color about fiscal \u201816 and \u201917. And we look into the breakdown between product and subscriptions obviously both are really doing well like now, but 2017, who could you envision that the breakdown between product and subscriptions heading towards, any color you can share with us? Andrew Del Matto : Yeah, so Shaul, we are not really - we don\u2019t really guide product versus subscription mix. You know I would qualitatively, we are - believe we think about it as we somewhat agnostic to how people buy you know virtual and physical. And it\u2019s also hard to predict how that\u2019s happen you know to service provider and other you know sales do well. So you know I don\u2019t it would be useful to provide that, but we do see kind of an overall market growth opportunity that we\u2019ve talked about and beyond to really exploring the common territory. It\u2019s just hard to know who the people really going to buy or how to predict. Shaul Eyal : Got it, that\u2019s fair. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Imtiaz Koujalgi from Deutsche Bank. Imtiaz, please go ahead. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the previous question, if you look at the products and services that\u2019s been trending more and more toward products for the last couple of quarter, can you comment on the services given that mix shift towards products - product that\u2019s driving that? Andrew Del Matto : Sure, Imtiaz. I mean I think we talked - I mean from a - let me get I mean in the products and segment, just think about this, you know your service revenue really comes overtime, so higher growth model, you know that revenue gets differed and so you are going to see waiting to product keeps upfront, which is reflection of new installation. Think about like that. And then you could differed revenue grew nicely quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, I think we\u2019ve mentioned those numbers on the call. And so you know that\u2019s really the point there. So you\u2019re going to kind of see that product line lead the growth in the company and then the services in subscription revenue follow overtime. So the change of differed is a good metric to kind of allocation that, right. Well I will just remind you that the differed revenue balance at the beginning of the year is a much higher than the quarterly revenue number when you look at the growth rate. In terms of products themselves the 3700D, the high end of the products 3700D, 1500D have done very done. Ken, anything to add on products? Ken Xie : I think you know I like to see the seven something take a few years to starting see some of the benefit even look at the when we go five years ago that time probably only 200 not they are building about another, so that\u2019s where - but five years ago, some of the part is still buying the service, right so that\u2019s way the product the leading indicator was the product in the lifetime value is probably more towards the service long term wise. And that we see the huge value of keeping that expanding the product sales into the customer. I think the demand also speak the same and so the long term value is very huge on the potential service revenue. Michelle Spolver : And then if I could add few tap is that part of your question was a tax rate of services and\u2026 Imtiaz Koujalgi : Yeah. Michelle Spolver : It\u2019s still for the FortiGate products, the majority of people who buy the product, the part of our subscriptions in bundle versus buying one at a time. And so it felt hard to - I mean our tax rate is very, very good, it\u2019s hard to track it overtime simple because most buy the bundle upfront. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Got it and then the APT product, is that growing product or is that a subscripting attached to the product or is that time saving to drive more product revenues? Michelle Spolver : It\u2019s both, yeah we have an option, so we have reported FortiSandbox appliance which be a product sale with the subscription that come top of that or customer can use FortiGate device with an APT, it\u2019s one of subscription, so that which has been\u2026 Andrew Del Matto : To be at a bundle well, and you know again if you go back to the model, the graphic we showed on the call, you know it explains the strategy where you really acquiring customers whether it\u2019s - we\u2019re kind of agnostic again, we think it it\u2019s a platform whether it\u2019s hardware or subscriptions physical and virtual which really is basically installing relationship that you could add on more things overtime. And by looking at that you know you think of a high CLV building ourselves tenure relationships creates another ladder verity of ladders including the up sell, cross sale, renew, resale is important concept for us, thinking at that way, you know people talk about firewall refreshes and so you think about resale, that\u2019s why we offered retention rate. And then that also leads to kind of another ladder if you will of tenure, right because if you look at customers overtime, the ability of extend that time also add value in terms of how you think about the company right retaining customer up selling and cross selling them, renewing them, reselling them, all those things go into that field along with retention. Imtiaz Koujalgi : That\u2019s very helpful. One last one if I many. As Ken mentioned a number of new customers this quarter, 8,000, it seems like high number, I\u2019ve that heard number from you guys before. How is it compared to the number of customers you typically acquire in prior quarters? Michelle Spolver : It\u2019s about consistent, it\u2019s a new metric that we\u2019ve given, you can go back if you have time and - you can go back in our Qs and see how that the number of customer has grown, but it\u2019s relatively consistent, I think now is the quality not just the quantity of customer. So I think it\u2019s fair say that you know if you look at it through large deals and other metrics that we gave in our business had a higher amount probably towards the high end in enterprise. Andrew Del Matto : Yeah, so that\u2019s the good point. I mean Michelle had a good point of that just maybe going back and taking a look at some of the larger deals and the growth there because it always shows a shift into the type of customer that we\u2019re looking for. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Got it, very helpful, thank you very much guys. Operator : Okay, thank you and our next question comes from Rohit Chopra from Buckingham Research Group. Sir, please go ahead. Rohit Chopra : Thank you. Thanks for letting me ask some question here. I had three questions for you. Drew, just maybe a clarification first on the sales marketing spend, is that still focused in North America or there are other areas where you think or other regions were you think you need to spend and maybe APAC didn\u2019t have that growth, is that a place we need to invest? Andrew Del Matto : Well the - maybe we start with APCA, I think that\u2019s easy. And the first one I think we\u2019re still growth 2X the market there, so we\u2019re grabbing shares, so that\u2019s the good thing. The second part of the question is, yeah, we probably do need to make a few more investments there. We actually did a bit of leadership transition throughout the year and I think that\u2019s part of the explanation there. So one of that more was probably towards more the first half of the year and that region is starting to pick up and actually seeing nice return. Again suggesting the right people really matter in space, that we really believe in that. And then you know the second piece happened later and the second transition happened later. So that\u2019s APJ, so we\u2019ll continue with that there. We will continue, we will bet globally kind of add scale but in the U.S. yeah we are really building up the marketing team and the vertical, a lot of that happened at the end of Q4 you know towards the end of the year which we talked about and we will continue to look at opportunities there and globally as well as we see opportunities. Rohit Chopra : Then when you did highlight some of the investments that you are going to make at the end of your prepared remarks, you indicated some flexibility, what would cause you to maybe pullback on the investments, what are the some of the - maybe some of the markers that would make it bit more cautious and you can pullback and maybe we feel bit more leverage in the models? Andrew Del Matto : You know I think at the terms of pulling back you know obviously the things you are going to look at you know a significant shifts in the market change - the change in the market. Then also you know I mean really something tragic in the global economy you know would obviously give us some level cause as well. Rohit Chopra : Okay and then the last one is more for Ken and Ken just more at a high level, you guys have been taking a lot of share from incumbents and I know you mentioned on this call and almost every other call, but where do you think we are in that cycle, are we on the back half of that or we on the - there is still a ton of room and the reason I ask you Ken is because when I look at your - look at Juniper, I was going to say, your company but when I look at Juniper, and I look at what they have left as far security, there isn\u2019t very much and that just one example. But I just wanted to know where you think we are and the whole game of taking share from incumbents? Ken Xie : I think probably most depend on a vertical space little bit. I still see a relatively probably huge potential in that space both because there is mobile device and also the new infrastructure FortiRG is another potential there. So that\u2019s but also will be lot a - going forward. Other part - on the price is relatively Greenfield specter some of the new vertical for us and the past the secure internal on the product we have huge advantage, that\u2019s secure inside enterprise is fairly new market opportunity, potential can be huge, so also have huge advantage. On SMB, I don\u2019t see changing much as a quite consistent in a last few quarter or even few years. We consistent and customer using some new technology like our new system-on-chip to have a better like a performance function cost compared to our competitor, so we also grow faster to gain market share in SMB, but the long term value to potential growth with this well is in some other down the price and also they being carried which positive in some stage to ramp up. Also we mentioned the transition of changing started happening in the space the traditional way of secured boarder or secured fixed desktop machine whatever is no longer enough, it\u2019s really the how to secure the mobile device, how to secure inside the parameter if fairly the new trend, which we have huge advantage. And we are the only company, no more secured company build their own basic system label which can give a lot of performance boost and give a lot of additional function compared to some other competitor which have some softer expertise. Rohit Chopra : Thanks Ken, Thanks Drew. Ken Xie : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Daniel Ives from FBR Capital Markets. And Daniel you line is open. Mr. Daniel, your phone be muted, if you can check your mute button please because we\u2019re unable to hear you at the moment. Again the question is coming Daniel Ives. I am assuming, he step the way, we\u2019ll take our next question from Aaron Schwartz. Please go ahead Aaron. Aaron Schwartz : Great, good after. Just two real quick questions. If I open the competitive question, Juniper been downward but it seems that that has accelerated to the downside, is there anything more specific you are doing to target that revenue base, you are obviously the more natural company from share gains. And then secondly, Drew, can you just walk through the inventory that seem to have a bit larger negative impact on the cash flow statement and just wanted to get thoughts on what happened there and just how you are planning inventory into next year? Thank. Andrew Del Matto : Right, why don\u2019t I take the second one first Aaron. So inventory, yeah build up little bit. I think when we\u2019re obviously building to make sure you know we could serve as the customer that we see, we also don\u2019t want to run off early in the quarter. So there is a bit natural ramp of that. And one of the other things we\u2019re experiencing is along of new product introductions you know which you have to kind of buy, you have to buy general inventory, you have to ramp up some of the inventory, we\u2019re in the middle of verities of new product introductions I\u2019ve explained part of it. But I think most of trends to be the organic side, well we are seeing a little more on what I would say is almost non-organic is we are seeing some issues with the port and the port where there is work slowdown, basically work slowdown to get things off the boat. And we literally we\u2019ve had inventory sitting on port for a while, so being a little cautious in terms of having the ability to have product available to serve our customer when need. And then is also a long lead time on chips from one of our suppliers, that extended also five months now. And so there is a bit of long lead time, so you kind of building up and ramping being able to support the growth that we need. And so it\u2019s a little more - little tougher to predict that and we are just trying to cautious and make sure we can service our customer. We generally want to product ones they order it, we\u2019re trying to avoid backlogs to be fair. Ken Xie : Yeah, seems for the first question, we don\u2019t particularly see gaining share out from Juniper, sometime we see gaining more share from some other software based network security vendor. I think when from that and then now we have to reach and building some ASIC based firewall, but so they have some performance advantage compared to modest software competitor, but I have to say they are later now and keep the innovation of some of the new function. But on other side, our advantage most of them are performance and the new multifunction platform and which has much better like a deploy into lot of carriers in some high environment and also the system also have lot of advantage some SMB branch office, so that\u2019s where we see a lot of market share gaining as some of kind of advantage using the performance probably more towards them of a software based network vendor. Aaron Schwartz : Terrific, thank you very much. Operator : Okay, thank you, so this does conclude our Q&A session for today. I\u2019d like to now turn it back to Michelle for any closing remarks. Michelle Spolver : Thank you John. Thank you everybody for the time you spend today with us, it\u2019s obviously a busy and busy week. If you know, we have a second call scheduled at 3 :30 if you dive deeper into the information we gave you, please feel free to call back in and you can ask additional questions at that time. And that\u2019s it, so for who you want to call in, we\u2019ll speak to in about 45 minutes. Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Thank you for the time and support. Operator : Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

A replay of this call will also be available on our website. Note that we routinely post information on our website and we encourage you to make use of that resource. With that let me now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Michelle. And thanks to everyone join the call today. I am very pleased with Fortinet's execution during the first quarter. We have a strong start to the year time significantly with our guidance across all key operation metrics. And in fact, we achieved the highest year-over-year building growth ever since it becoming public company five and half years ago. Our all results continue to clearly show our investment strategy is working. We are executing extremely well and this is strong demand in the market for Fortinet's best-in-class portal services. During the quarter, we continue to expand sales within existing account as well as acquired over 8000 new customers adding to our large existing customer base of more than 225,000 which included most of Fortune Global 100 companies. We also again nicely grow the number of large deals with enterprise and service providers which as we discussed last quarter, is key to our long-term growth strategy, as this high end customers provide compounding life time value and are beneficial to our business model over time. The service provider environment remain dynamic and vendors and it only gaining in severity. As a result, network security is among the highest priority for enterprise but beyond product refresh purchases, we are now looking and architecting the entire security infrastructures. Today's highly sophisticated architecture find a way to circumvent parameter firewall defenses, so compromise device such as smartphone, laptops and USB drives and a large amount of attack actually originate within. Once inside the network, the most precious information is under risk and most network security systems are not currently designed to defend against this type attacks. There is a need to protect a network front inside out. This is resulting in evolution beyond the multifunctional security to multilayered security in which high-speed security plans are deployed inside the network to protect key resource such as R&D servers holding design information, finance servers with sensitive finance and cost information, our HR servers with confidential employee information. Fortinet has a strong and definite advantage here, giving our ability to provide a deep security and 10, 40, and 100 speed gig line speed, not internal network ground net. Though still in the early stage, we believe the internal multilayer security market provide additional growth opportunity for us especially in enterprise. Fortinet offers a broad platform that enables a seamless and integrated network security fabric not including internal, data center, parameter and end point security plus advanced threat protection. All product continue to experience strong market adoption and validation from credible third parties. One of the many example is the NSS next-generation IPS group testing released today in which Fortinet's FortiGate 1500D appliance received the best recommended position on a secure value map and score high mark of security, performance and a total cost of ownership over competitors. You can see this result on Slide 3. Fortinet also recently earned NSS recommended region in next-generation firewall APT, firewall and Web application firewall competitive group test. Additionally, we are seeing healthy momentum for our recently introduced FortiSandbox advanced threat protection of APT appliance. During Q1 we won several APT deals against FireEye and others including a global Fortune 50 automaker, a leading European telecommunication provider and the large U.S. retailer. Fortinet is winning based on our ability to offer a truly synchronized approach to detect, mitigate, prevent, and educate a wider variety of advanced threats to in equation of FortiSandbox with our FortiGate, FortiMail appliance and FortiGuard subscription. In last week we announced our APT platform has been extended to the end point with our next-generation FortiClient solution that can now communicate seamlessly with FortiSandbox to quickly stop threat entering in and both own network and all network end point devices. FortiClient recently received AV comparative highest advanced plus retail for detection and to-date more than 2 million users have downloaded the software. We\u2019re excited about technology advancement and started a new version of FortiClient offers. Only FortiClient offers such broad and integrate protection in a security platform at scale from end point to the cloud from megabyte to terabyte and can be deployed across the organization from the smallest office to the largest datacenter. This week Fortinet will be exhibiting an ISC show. It's my 20th year attending and during this time I have seen hundreds of company come and go. Very few has grown, innovative, and impacted the industry the way Fortinet has. The network security industry is in a critical inflection point right now. It is being transformed by the new generation security vendor like Fortinet who are growing and separating from the legacy vendors that are lagging. Fortinet is clearly our leader in this transformation with a strong security focus and our commitment to innovation. We're well positioned to maintain momentum given our proven security platform. Strong technology advantage, and the expected continued return on our investment strategy. Now let me return the call to Drew to review our financial result for Q1 and beyond. Andrew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. In all respect, Fortinet delivered a fantastic first quarter. We exceeded our guidance and showed strength across all key operating metrics, further validating that our investment strategy is working. As Ken mentioned, we achieved our strongest year-over-year billings growth in more than five years as a public company. I'm pleased to share that during the first quarter, Fortinet's billings increased 36% year-over-year to $254 million, significantly exceeding our guided range of $226 million to $230 million. Total revenue of $230 million was up 26% year-over-year, also well above the high end of our guided range of $200 million to $205 million. And our deferred revenue balance increased to $600 million up 33% year-over-year. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margin was 9% also above our guidance. We were able to deliver margin upside primarily as a result of topline over performance as well as a positive impact from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 was also above the high end of our guidance of approximately $0.06 and also benefited from the positive foreign exchange impact. And finally our cash generation remains strong as evidenced by the $60 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter. This was a 100% increase year-over-year when excluding the $20 million settlement we received from Palo Alto Networks in Q1 of 2014. Important to note, is that our billings, deferred revenue and adjusted free cash flow is outpacing our overall revenue growth year-over-year, which is a positive indicator for our future revenue growth. Our strong top line performance during the first quarter was a result of a healthy security market driven by factors Ken just discussed, a strong competitive position and an ongoing return from our sales and marketing investments. We continue to grow and strengthen our enterprise sales force including building out our key vertical teams, while still early our marketing investments are also beginning to yield returns with lead quality and conversion rates improving nicely and contributing to continued improvement in sales productivity. All of this is enabling us to gain market share. When new customers and expand within existing customer accounts especially in the enterprise. Evidence of this success could be seen in our large deal activity. During the first quarter, our number of larger deals once again grew nicely. Deals over $100,000 grew 36%. Deals over $250,000 grew 51%. Deals over $500,000 grew 28%. And finally deals over $1million experienced highest year-over-year return growth of all categories. In addition, the U.S. enterprise remain the fastest growing segment of our business growing 70% year-over-year as we continue to win deals with premier Fortune 100, Fortune 50, and even Fortune 5 companies. Like service providers, enterprises are very sticky due to regulatory and compliance requirements and are also a more frequent target of security breaches. Once we acquire an enterprise customer, we retain them for years and are able to upsell them more products over time resulting in very attractive lifetime value economics. Our best-of-breed integrated platform is very appealing to our customers and a differentiator for Fortinet. The enrichment of our end-to-end platform is a key element of our expansion strategy. Consistent with what we shared last quarter, our analysis of the top 100 customers in each of our three geographic regions over a five year period shows that for every $1, the customer initially spent, they spend an additional $5 over a five year period. They cost more to acquire than retain a customer and these customers represents rich opportunities to upsell, cross-sell and renew over time. So, it\u2019s easier to see how the investments we're making today can help us in the future on both the top and bottom lines. We believe this will be a driver for margin leverage for us over time as our base of enterprise customers continues to grow and mature. Representative of the success we\u2019re seeing with the strategy during the first quarter, we acquired several new large enterprise customers that chose Fortinet's FortiGate next-generation firewall appliance and FortiGuard subscription services over competitive solutions for Palo Alto Networks, CheckPoint, Cisco, and Juniper. Some of these customers included a Fortune 15 technology company and the Fortune 50 automaker with two of the most well-known brands in the world along with a large U.S. government agency and a leading South American financial services company. Additionally, we won a seven figure firewall expansion deal with one of the largest non-profit health systems in the United States. This customer chose an integrated security platform from Fortinet and replaced various point solutions from CheckPoint, Cisco, Sourcefire and BlueCoat. This was one of Fortinet's largest healthcare transaction ever and a clear endorsement of our integrated platform and the value of our vertical sales strategy. In addition to acquiring new customers during Q1, we also had success expanding business with existing customers by up selling more FortiGate appliances across selling non-FortiGate products to our large existing customer base. One of these large upsell deals was a seven figure win with one of the worlds largest telecommunication providers that is a long time Fortinet customer and has spent more than $15 million globally since it\u2019s initial purchase. Additionally, we closed seven figure upsell deals with a Fortune 50 technology company and with another large U.S. federal agency. We also had several key cross-sell deals where we sold non-FortiGate products such as our FortiSandbox ATP, and FortiMail messaging appliances and FortiGuard subscription services to existing Fortinet customers. These deals included a large U.S. retailer, a European telecommunications company and a European government agency which Ken mentioned earlier. We won these deals over FireEye, Cisco and Palo Alto Networks due to our superior performance and our infrastructure integration abilities with FortiSandbox for ATP and FortiMail for email security. And finally, we had many large subscription and support renewal deals with existing Fortinet customers. Our renewal rates, which attract by appliance is not customers remain in the mid-70% range and do not account for product refresh purchases. However, our customer retention rate is above 90% which is demonstrative of overall customer satisfaction as well as the stickiness of our solutions. Our high renewal and retention rates also show that we\u2019re not only winning numerous customers from exposed incumbents but we are keeping them. Our breakdown of billings across our top five verticals remained relatively consistent with service provider at 23%, government at 11%, financial services at 8%, education at 8% and retail at 8%. Now turning to some additional Q1 details. Geographically, year-over-year billings growth was again strong across all regions. The America's grew 33%, EMEA billings grew 47% and APAC grew 23%. As noted earlier in the America's we saw continued strength in the U.S. enterprise segment which grew 70% year-over-year driven by many large deals with leading enterprise brands. In EMEA, our growth rate was the highest we\u2019ve achieved in seven years despite the foreign exchange headwind from the weaker currency and difficult comparison to last Q1. However performance was the result of exceptional execution across the region especially in the U.K., Germany and Northern Europe. APAC also saw good performance and meet a challenging regional economic environment with particularly strong results from Southeast Asia, Korea and India. Turning to billings by product segment on Slide 6, we continue to see diversity of product billings across all segments. Our high end FortiGate products accounted for 37% of billings driven by continued enterprise adoption of our high end appliances such as the FortiGate 1500D and 3700D. Our midrange enterprise products accounted for 26% of total product billings and our entry-level products accounted for 37%. As a reminder, our product billings mix varies quarter-to-quarter based on the models of products to makeup all size deals. As I mentioned earlier, total revenue was $213 million up 26% year-over-year and significantly above our guided range of $200 million to $205.  On a geographic basis you can see on slide seven and eight; the revenues continue to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. In the Americas revenues grew 26% to $91.6 million in price, 43% of total revenues. EMEA revenues were $75.7 million up 34% and APAC revenues increased 15% to $45.7 million. Moving to non-GAAP expenses and profitability, during the first quarter, consolidated total non-GAAAP gross profit margins were 71% which was at the high end of our guided range. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 58% relatively consistent with last quarter as we remained focused on acquiring new customers for long term value. Non-GAAP service gross margins were 82% highlighting recurring nature in margin expansion value of FortiGuard and our FortiCare subscription offerings. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $131.2 million during the first quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $20.1 million or 9% of total revenue and well above our guidance. This included a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately $2.5 million or 1% of total revenue. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $14 million or $0.08 per share based on $174 million diluted shares outstanding and above our guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 35%. A reconsolidation of non-GAAP and GAAP financials can be seen on Slide 14 and 15. As seen on Slide 12, we ended Q1 with a strong balance sheet including $1.70 million in cash and investments, up from $992 million at the end of Q4. The increase was primarily driven by the $65 million in cash generated from operations. As previously mentioned, free cash flow was $60 million in the first quarter, a 100% increase year-over-year when excluding the $20 million settlement we received from Palo Alto networks in Q1 of \u201814. Our continued strong cash flow reflects our ability to both reinvest in the company to support growth and also generate cash that will benefit future growth. Annualized inventory turns for Q1 were $1.9 slightly below our annualized goal of to are better. As we mentioned in our January earnings call, we made conscious decision to take prevented steps to increase inventory to mitigate potential issues from the West Coast port labor disputes. Our deferred revenue balance increased $600 million up $149 million or 33% year-over-year and $41 million sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to consistent renewals and services attached sales to new or existing customers. Now let me finish with some commentary on our guidance. Starting with the second quarter 2015 which can be seen on slide 13, as a reminder all forward-looking statements including all of the guidance statements provided are subject to Michelle's cautions at the start of this call. We expect billings to be in the range of $263 million to $268 million up approximately 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $224 million to $228 million up 23% year-over-year at the mid point. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% to 71%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 9% to 10% this reflects our continued investments to drive growth as well as the ongoing absorption cost of new hires made in 2014 and during the first part of 2015. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.08 to $0.09 based on an expected diluted share account in the range of $174 million to $176 million fully diluted shares. Turning to guidance for the full year 2015, we are increasing billings and revenue expectations even above the first quarter over performance due to ongoing demand we are seeing globally for our solutions. Billings are now expected to be in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.120 billion up 24% year-over-year at the mid point and an increase form the $1.65 billion to $1.80 billion we previously estimated. This increase guidance reflects our overall performance during the first quarter as well as our ongoing confidence for a strong year. While also taking into a account the high growth rates delivered throughout 2014. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $935 million to $940 million up 22% year-over-year at the mid point and an increase from the prior guidance of $915 million to $925 million.  Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 70% to 71% and we\u2019re maintaining our non-GAAP operating margin guidance of approximately 14% which showed leverage in our operating model and then our growth strategy is working. We believe our investments will benefit us long term from a customer lifetime value perspective. Our original 2015 guidance anticipated operating margin improvements throughout the year and we are still comfortable with this. We are not changing our full year operating margin guidance at this point as it is still early in the year, we still have lot of new people ramping and we want room to continue to invest appropriately for growth. And finally we expect non-GAAP earning per share to be in the range of approximately $0.51 per share to $0.52 per share based on an expected diluted share count in the range of $175 million to $177 million fully diluted shares. This is up from our previous guidance of $0.49 per share to $0.50 per share. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that, Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator, you may start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling, please go ahead. Jackson Ader : Hi, guys. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling. One question from us on inventories. I know you guys mentioned that you've been intentionally building some inventories because of some of the port impacts. Is that everything as far as what the inventory impact has been? And what do you guys think that will look like going forward? Andrew Del Matto : We hold to our annualized guidance of two or better on inventory turns, we don\u2019t think that will change, we just - this issue we talked about in the January call, we were really concerned about the port strike for anybody in the Bay area, we saw the Bay, you could see all the ships parked in the middle of the Bay there for quite a while and lot of our products was sitting out there. So we literally have to fly things in which actually is what - then they held the strike and then we got our inventory off the boats and the stuff we flight in, so we had a little more inventory than we probably would have liked. We\u2019re moving the inventories, we don't have it overall inventory problem if you will, or an obsolescence problem but it did cause us to go below the two threshold, I think here temporarily. The other thing I would point out on that is flying it in cost a lot more than shipping it in be it water, and then also touched us a bit on the product gross margin line. Jackson Ader : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Walter Prichard from Citi. Walter, please go ahead. Walter Prichard : Hi thanks. Drew, let me just quantify the - you mentioned the benefit to profitability this quarter from currency. I'm wondering if you can just quantify that either dollars or percentage on margin? Andrew Del Matto : Yes it was about $2.5 million. I think we said 1% of revenue roughly that is what it was. Walter Prichard : And then just maybe a follow-up for Ken on the enterprise side. I'm wondering, you're seeing really good success, you talked about 70% growth. Have you seen any sort of evolution in terms of what types of deals those are as you're having more success in enterprise where is the incremental success coming there? Ken Xie : We see deals both we placed in some of the current solution which they bought few years ago and also adding additional layer to protect internal server. So that, as mentioned now the network security space changing from the multifunction to the multilayer prevention right now. So we see especially a lot of large enterprise see the importance of deploy some network security inside the company to protect their server and their department. Walter Prichard : And, Ken, just if I can drill down on that a little bit more. Versus success you were having a year ago, is that more - do you attribute that more to better coverage on the sales side or do you think you refreshed some of your product. I'm wondering if you attribute it more to having a better aligned product with where the need is there? Ken Xie : I think both, we started building some vertical team like to mention in like finance service and healthcare. So we can see a lot of new winning in this area but also the product also we're keeping improving. So a lot of new product now covered by the MP6 which is much faster chip and to help and deploy in the high speed environment now. Walter Prichard : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Jonathan, please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Guys, can you hear me okay? Ken Xie : Yes good. Jonathan Ho : Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just wanted to get a little bit more color in terms of the strength that you saw in the EMEA region and maybe why we see sort of a resurgence there just to start off. Andrew Del Matto : Sure Jonathan. Quite frankly it is just excellent execution on our go-to-market model there. I think we made our early investments there probably earlier than we have made elsewhere. And the team there is just performing exceptionally well as you can see in the phase of top currency headwind to be frank and I think we attribute that to basically having the right leadership, having the right team and then building out the marketing side of the go-to-market model very well and so they have done very well in terms of building kind of an integrated end-to-end go-to-market model which we are replicating elsewhere. We would also like to point - I guess I would also point out that the people we\u2019ve seen come in and ramp there are ramping faster than we\u2019ve seen historically, I think in Fortinet and so over the last year that team has ramped faster than their predecessors would say and I think that attributes to the investments we\u2019ve made on the marketing side. And just getting it right bringing in professionals who\u2019ve been there, done that and doing it here with an excellent product set. That combined with what I would characterize as an excellent security opportunity combined with our best breed integrated platform is just resonating extremely well there. Jonathan Ho : Got it. And then I think one of the things that we were trying to understand a little bit better is how much of your growth, if you guys could maybe quantify this, is coming from larger deals that you are able to sell this multilayer approach into versus picking up new customers versus just having larger deals as you target the enterprise. I'm just trying to understand some of the dynamics around what's driving the growth, if you could maybe segment it among those buckets. Andrew Del Matto : I will do my best. I think you could tell from our verticals numbers that those haven\u2019t shifted much but I think the growth really is coming out of the Enterprise segment and I would characterize that more towards larger end of the enterprise. Right now we seem to do very well, where people take a very hard look at the products, they look at the strategy in terms of integrated best of breed and our focus that we can provide. Then they also test the products and as the NSS test which Ken referred to obviously play a role. They are very savvy, sophisticated differentiating buyers and we resonate extremely well at that level. So I think that's the key thing and the other thing I would say is we are getting the right marketing dollars in place. So customers know who we are before we get there, they have a sense for us and provide us a great opportunity along with bringing in professionals with relationship. That is new enterprise, the large, high enterprise sales force didn\u2019t really exist several years ago and so that is something that we\u2019ve done more recently and expanded into the verticals probably in the last six months or so. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re also seeing these people as we build the go to market engine, get the marketing right, the legend side of it right, we\u2019re seeing people, seeing sales people ramp faster than they historically ramped before. Michelle Spolver : And then I would add Jonathan, it\u2019s Michelle, Jonathan. The only thing I would add is that is I think you covered three points and specifically the multilayered security was one of that. That is still early on in the process. Ken mentioned, that we had deals in that but it is still early. So I would say that is more of a growth driver than with contributing to growth right now. Andrew Del Matto : And just also point out I think the enterprise is where the security sea level boardroom issue is most profound. So we are kind of hitting the mark there I think. Jonathan Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Melissa Gorham with Morgan Stanley. Melissa, your line is open. Melissa Gorham : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm calling in for Keith Weiss. Ken, just wanted to delve into the billing strength again. You mentioned earlier the strength related to a refresh cycle. I'm just wondering if you believe that there still is kind of a refresh cycle going on and, if so, what kind of phase of the cycle we're in currently and how much do think that impacted your results? Ken Xie : I think there is few in the probably in the mid of refresh cycle to upgrade from the old like a single function or intuition box but this is the multifunction box was a connection firewall UTM. So that's and to say today probably majority enterprise do not quite update to this new generation yet. So that is going and same time and also we see the new opportunity especially in the large enterprise for the multilayer protection and also the opportunity in the service provider in the carrier to offer the clean pipe to secure the mobile device. So we see like a multiple trend and multiple opportunity to grow in this area right now and like to mention security now becomes highest priority for the management, for the board and is the market, is the space, like in my 20 plus years this is probably the hardest time to do the network security right now. Melissa Gorham : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just wanted to follow up on Endpoint. You did mention that you'll be releasing a new version. You have had FortiClient for a while now, but are you seeing kind of a turn where you have your traditional customers that would buy network security increasingly also wanting to buy Endpoint, and then can you maybe talk about how big of a business that is for you today and maybe how fast it's growing? Ken Xie : We see a lot of interest and the customer really like the FortiClient with this added ATP capability. So we have over 2 million user and for FortiClient we offer free download and then they pay for the supporting fee, pay for the service. Now we have the FortiClient linking with the FortiGate, with FortiSandbox, with FortiMail with some other appliance which mostly in the network side in the central office. So that\u2019s where once you link all this end point with network device, with management all together, we are going to much better inadequate protection compared to some other end points related to isolated device themselves. So that's where we see a lot of customer who are interested in this approach and then give them better multiple layer of protection, especially a lot of our mobile device now they can protect together with the network side. Melissa Gorham : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Brent, your line is open. Brent Thill : In Q1 you announced some new bundled pricing solutions that tie a lot of different products together. I'm just curious if you started to see some success with those solutions and, if so, are you seeing longer durations added initially in some of these original contracts that you're signing? Andrew Del Matto : Great question, Brent. So we announced the increase in middle of January. It actually takes somewhere between 30 to 90 days to really work its way through the channel. So I don't just say best case here, you are getting it in quotes in probably early March possibly late February. But most of it isn\u2019t - I would say it's too early to call from that perspective. I don\u2019t think it provided much of the tailwind if you say from the billings perspective, I think that too early. What it does do interestingly enough is because the way we actually estimate the revenue piece, the product a little more gets differed now because you're actually attributing, you have a higher differed component or subscription component, routable component if you will. And so it actually takes down the near term revenue just the end quarter revenue a little bit because you\u2019re now marking - you kind of benchmark that deferred component to the new price which is a little bit higher. And so, I would say if anything, I mean on billings it was probably neutral, on revenue its probably a couple million of just kind of pushed to deferred if you will. I wouldn\u2019t call that hugely significant but just point out that it in terms of how it impacted us its probably slight near term mark on revenue, little up on deferred revenue and because the product revenue goes down a little bit it also impacts the products a bit. Brent Thill : Okay. So you think it\u2019s a catalyst more going forward in the next couple of quarters? Andrew Del Matto : Yes I think so, and I could say this, if you want a qualitative perception we've been talking to the field, its something that our channel really likes especially as you get into the mid and higher level deals it just gets increasingly important. They are like a higher price, they think there is a lot of value there. We do a really good job of enriching our product offerings over time as we add components to it, the functionality and keeping it up to date. And so, the channel likes it the higher price means more money for them. Brent Thill : Okay. And just clarification on the 8000 customers you added. Was that relative to what you saw in past quarters, can you just give us a sense of where that stood? Andrew Del Matto : Yes. I think that's consistent. Michelle Spolver : Yes. It's similar. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Matthew Niknam from Goldman Sachs. Matthew, please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just one on margins. Guidance implies second quarter margins are pretty flattish sequentially at about 9%, but you're sticking with the 14% guide for the year. Just if you can help us understand the trajectory in the back half of the year and what gives you confidence in such a steep implied ramp in 3Q and 4Q? Thanks. Andrew Del Matto : Sure Matthew. Again we've guided for Q2 and we've guided for the full year of 2014 and so obviously it implies a ramp. I'm going to have to let you how you want to do it from your model perspective but we\u2019re very comfortable with the 2014. Our comfort has to do with the fact one, that what we look at internally suggest we\u2019re very conscious about how and where we spend, we\u2019re very disciplined. Again I would point out that\u2019s its all on the sales and marketing line, a lot of it is very programmatic and headcount driven at this point and so we know the dials on how to engineer that result if we need to. And quite honestly we feel very good about our forecast and how we are going to proceed through the year. Our plans are very crisp and we\u2019re going to execute those and if we do that, which we believe we will then, we are very comfortable we can hit that target. Matthew Niknam : And just a follow-up. So that kind of implies the sales and marketing ramp we've been up about 50% year-on-year the last two quarters. I think that kind of implies we begin to flatten out that ramp in 3Q and 4Q? Andrew Del Matto : Well from a percentage perspective obviously get to 2014 and probably have improved but from a dollar perspective it\u2019s just, we know what the programs are, there are still some investment to make, we are kind of I would characterize it kind of mid-stream especially on the marketing side the verticals still have a little, you have to give them a little time to pay off. I think we are somewhere between four to six months into that program and I think it\u2019s reasonable to get people a year there to bear some fruit. And so I would call it kind of more mid-stream if you will. Matthew Niknam : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Imtiaz Koujalgi from Deutsche Bank. Imtiaz, please go ahead. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Hey, guys. Thanks for answering my question. I had a question on the billings. I think you answered this earlier, but just want to clarify. If you look at the duration of your contracts, did that go up substantially in this quarter versus the previous quarters? Ken Xie : This is similar. Andrew Del Matto : No I think it\u2019s very similar again Imtiaz we don\u2019t focus, we were agnostic as to the duration of the contract from a customer perspective, we let choose that and I think if anything I think if you look at the ratio long-term deferred to short-term deferred, overall deferred I think it might even compressed a little bit. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Got it. And then on the gross margins, if I look at the gross margins going back four or five quarters it's been going down every quarter. I think this quarter was kind of the lowest in the last few quarters. Just some more color on what's driving that. Andrew Del Matto : Well I think the margins overall have been consistent, we\u2019ve forecasted 71% and we hit that. The services margins I would highlight that those are very good and our focus has been on selling more subscriptions and virtual offerings and that looks to be doing very well and I think that is a great way to expand margins and so that strategy, that focus seems to be paying off. On the product side 58% I think that is not too dissimilar to what we have seen in the fairly recent past and there were couple of things that actually impacted that and I think I pointed these out, one would be the port of Oakland strike and so we had the fly in some inventory and it is short term issue and it caused more to flight and then ship it by board obviously and then the second piece of it was the increase in price of the bundles. And that is just an accounting thing where the overall billings probably get I think it is little too early to say there was a tailwind this quarter perhaps next quarter, the quarter after that but from an accounting perspective you\u2019re now attributing a little more to the subscription which causes little more of the billings to be deferred and so that drags down the revenue slightly. I think we have said a couple of million dollars and then a little bit extra cost from the port of Oakland strike and that hits the margin kind of all once in one quarter. Imtiaz Koujalgi : And then just one final one for me. I think you mentioned about the FX impact of $2.5 million benefit. Do you guys price in local currencies and that's why you got a benefit from the FX moves this quarter? Andrew Del Matto : No we price in USD, U.S. dollars and then we have costs in local currency and so that is primarily from Euros. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Okay. So the net impact was a benefit because you gain more on the cost side? Andrew Del Matto : Yes revenues and dollars are consistent and there is no change and then your cost are in Euros and there is obviously favorable benefit. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Okay, perfect, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from [Subul] [ph] from Juna Group. Please go ahead sir. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. I wanted to understand on the enterprise side if you could talk about the success how it's been split between campus branch opportunities versus data center as most of your success been on the data center side with your new wins. And also on the internal firewall opportunity, is that also for sort of east-west applications in the data center and what kind of competitive environment are you seeing from some of the virtual solutions out there? Ken Xie : This is Ken. I think it is a sweet different market, internal multilayer securities more apply for the enterprise campus there is really security department, different server within enterprise, some of servers in the data center but that is also little bit different than the data center security that\u2019s where like we are working with some like Cloud service providers and data center more using like Chase based 5000 or some 100 gig interface, so that\u2019s running security in the data center, sometime even deploy the product in virtual platform there. So out of five virtual platform including like VMware, Amazon, Microsoft and also it is all of the virtual platform there. So we do see that data center, virtual platform also ramp up quickly and then the branch office is the one especially in other retail space you can see they need have a box to cover all their branch need not only just security piece of that component but also even that communication, some of the Wi-Fi communication, even some of the voice communication. So that we also see ramp up very, very quickly because with this system-on-chips solution, we can offer the best TCO for the enterprise solution there. Unidentified Analyst : And is the data center firewall perimeter, is that the biggest piece of the enterprise business of these pieces you've described? Ken Xie : I see the data center still in early ramp up but is the enterprise, within enterprise campus that is the biggest piece and also that we also see ramp up very quickly, it is deploy there is a multilayered internal security because you can look on today\u2019s press release the news that is testing so we have the product, they just position us the best intrusion prevention system and the same box also test last year as the best firewall and also the best firewall platform. Because when you deploy it inside enterprise you need to have the box capable to handle all type application because we see this is new opportunity within enterprise and multiple layer campus security. Michelle Spolver : And then Subul the only thing I would add to it is Michelle and we talked about most of the deals that we highlighted as some of the key deals for the quarter were data center, enterprise data center deals or is the core next generation firewall or firewall. So I mean we don\u2019t - we haven\u2019t broken out where we are not reporting a metric in terms of breaking out the enterprise business by the type of deployment but I would say if you look at Fortinet today versus two or three years ago there would be a higher concentration for sure of the data center security versus for the branch type deployment. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Jeff Kvaal from Northland. Jeff, please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions, if possible. I think one is, could you help us understand a little bit better about the revenue impacts that you are seeing from the euro? I understand that you price in dollars, but to what extent is the fall in the euro forcing companies to cut back on their orders? What are you seeing in that realm? Andrew Del Matto : Okay. We are just seeing a hot security market, I don\u2019t think there is any other way to characterize that the market there because clearly there is a headwind there, we bill in dollars which you would think would typically be a challenge but I think security has just become paramount and so we are just really not seeing we can\u2019t say we\u2019re seeing much of an impact once in a while we will hear something, somebody might say that the price is challenging or something like that but we seem to be working through those and it\u2019s a lot less than you would expect. Ken Xie : It is Ken. I feel Fortinet growth is more limit by the sales capacity and also execution because we have a much better product, when in product testing or beta, we win most of that and thus you can see whether in the carrier in the Fortune 100 enterprise whenever there is a beta testing and we have highest winning rate compared to competitor, once we have full capacity in Europe, in America few quarters ago you can see the results kind of ramp up very quickly, the symptom for some of the vertical space in U.S. that is where you match in and we believe we can have some work as result come in. Andrew Del Matto : And then Jeff just to add on I think raises a good point, we view ourselves as a market disruptor in our price performance and if you look at the NSS lab test, we tend to be in the upper right quadrant because the correlating security effectiveness which we perform at the highest level it is price per bit protected and are gigabit protected and we do very well. And so I think in the phase - when you look at us versus competitors, we still come across as a very effective solution both from security, from a security performance enterprise perspective. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Which segways actually into the second part of the question and that is, Ken, when you say that this market is still hot, is the hottest that you've seen in 20 years, that's a very strong statement and very impressive. To what extent do you think some of the strength that we are seeing in the market is cyclical and then how long, in your experience, might the cycles last? Ken Xie : I think some of the changing make increase up the network speed whether in the enterprise or in the home user, in the cloud or the keeping involving there and I think the most law still applies, so every 18, 24 months that the speed double, the, [indiscernible] semiconductor also double there, that's probably we're keep going there.  On other side I see - because a lot of applications that we move to the mobile device and also attack the threat come from like - passes more like they could connect attack that\u2019s what the traditional firewall they can break the connection and the secured the company with the parameter firewall. Now pretty much all the time we move to this agent based attack which they don\u2019t need up connection, they can just get into your smartphone, get into the compromised laptop, PC even the USB drive. And once they bring something inside which can bypass the parameter firewall, then a big trouble internally because internal networks all connect by the switch were high speed switch, which we don\u2019t have the capability to go to the higher layer to review the content, the user application to secure and to server department. So that\u2019s where once similar mobile device bring into the enterprise - compromise mobile device bring into the enterprise and then there is a huge security usually there. So that\u2019s where we see - until we can address the mobile device security, which whether by multilayer protection, all have some endpoint solution to secure a mobile device and the same time secure a pipe, I mean the traffic, other mobile device, otherwise I see still security is still a big issue. Andrew Del Matto : Yes and Jeff, I know the question was to Ken but I can't resist adding on - I think what\u2019s different is that, I mean all the breaches, all the headline events, I think have been a game changer for everyone over the last year and probably looking forward. I mean a year ago we\u2019re talking about target, we get on to talking about some consumer breaches, maybe the Apple event and now we here we will forward to anthem and TV monitor for instance. And you\u2019ve got President Obama, talking about terrorism and I think its hard to ignore, without I want to seem over height but its hard to ignore, its hard for corporations to ignore that because it now goes to their brand that I think one of the game changers clearly as that they now know they\u2019re more cyber security is more about then protecting their own assets they have to be stewards of consumer or customer data. And that goes to their brand and then obviously the whole cyber terrorism thing. Whoever that might not impact everybody but its, it creates a lot of attention on the space and I think that attention transcends into the, to the board level and the sea level and people are concerned about it, want to understand it, want to understand what their risks are, and want multilayers of security to picks and I think that just creates a huge tailwind a fact the probably hasn\u2019t existed in the past at the enterprise corporate level let\u2019s say. I think that\u2019s been there in the consumer level, if you go back in history but I think its more unique or more profound today at the corporate level than ever. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Now drivers make a lot of sense. I guess we all know that trees don't grow to the sky and everything, so we have to watch out for what may happen two or three years down the road or what have you. That's all I have, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Michael, please go ahead. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. Two questions. First, on the enterprise deals if you can characterize, is it mostly displacements on incumbents, if so, who, or is it more enterprise's building out some additional capacity or projects and you get in there? And then I have a second question. Michelle Spolver : So I will say most of them are displacements, I mean there is some of them that enterprise, I think what it is and we talked about it our script is that enterprise, many enterprises are looking at rather than just replacing a firewall, one firewall for a new firewall and changing vendors, its looking at doing it differently whether its going from the single function firewall to a multi function security solution or building out the infrastructure, look at the security differently but its not straight Greenfield type opportunity it really as far as displacing incumbents. Andrew Del Matto : Yes. And I think, if you go back to keep for Michael I think we saw more above, I think I would characterize Q1 to be displacing incumbents, I would not, there certainly was some expansion for sure, I think we mentioned that, that\u2019s definitely there, that\u2019s definitely part of our final and part of strategy. I would call it more of a timing thing, I thing Q1 just totaled probably little more towards new customers. Michael Turits : Okay. And then Drew I know you'll be disappointed if I didn't ask you about cash back, but I think you said it be $25 million this year? Are we still on for that and is there anything else that we should be aware of when modeling cash flow this year that might be out of the ordinary? Andrew Del Matto : No, I would stick to what I said last, I mean I actually said 20 to 30 Michael, and you said 25, was 25 a good numbers and I think, I agreed with you, so I'll stick with that. And then as far as CapEx goes, we\u2019re sticking to the 40 to 45 range for the year. Michael Turits : Okay. And nothing else in cash flow from ops that I should be aware. Andrew Del Matto : No, nothing, nothing else, we\u2019re very focused on to be fair, I think if you look at our model, because I do think there is a bit of a disconnecting the accelerated level of growth, certainly as you, you go north of 30%, the P&L becomes bit disconnected from the sales activity which we reflected more in billings. And now even more so in deferred revenue and then cash flow and so we very focused on ensuring we do everything we can around free cash flow for instance and, that might be like working capital for instance and just being very focused that were not, we\u2019re not consuming more cash then we need to. Michael Turits : Okay, great. Thanks great quarter. Appreciate it. Andrew Del Matto : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. So our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen & Company. Greg, please go ahead. Gregg Moskowitz : Thank you very much. Nice job on the quarter. Just a couple of questions. Drew, you alluded to briefly earlier the vertical you felt market strategy and targeting obviously financial services healthcare, cloud, federal as well. Can you just walk through the investment that's required there and what your expectations are terms of incremental demand in 2015 and beyond? Andrew Del Matto : Sure, so qualitatively you can see the compression of our margins reflected and as reflected by the 14%, guidance and I think the performance in Q1 which is little better than we guided and then Q2. And so it is a significant investment in terms of headcount, we don\u2019t share the number of headcount but its certainly a significant focus. In terms of the payback if you will or the time to kind of closing deal, I think you to really get rolling there probably takes, close to a year. I would say this though, early returns are very good. We closed what we believe is one of our largest healthcare deals as we mentioned in the script ever, one of our largest healthcare deals ever, we closed several federal deals, which were sizable.  And I think we\u2019re looking very good in the financial services area, little early there but, from what we can see and we look at our milestones there, we feel like we\u2019re hitting all of those are, the other thing I would mention, we are very, we tend to look at the funnel quite a bit, I used that as a metric to kind of gauge the - be a good barometer of the forward business. And that looks great as well as the productivity whether you\u2019re looking at the funnel based productivity or looking at the actual, people seem to be ramping better than the historically have here and I attributed that to the marketing investments we\u2019re making, I think that\u2019s going very well and then also I think the way we onboard people particularly in the enterprise is very good. We have seasoned professionals with proven track records coming in, not only with their own book of business or relationships if you will, but they\u2019re very good in onboarding people and building teams and I think we are seeing the benefit of that, we certainly hope you could see that over the next year in those verticals specifically. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay. That's very helpful, Drew. Thanks for that. And then just secondly, are there any changes to where the non-FortiGate mix stand as a percentage of total revenue or billings today? Michelle Spolver : Not materially, no. Ken Xie : So some area like we mentioned, we announced like last week that the 40 client now with - capability we see a lot of interest in that area, so we don\u2019t have like 2 million user download the software, which it is not a big number compared to some other endpoint solution provider but also not small number which we also found out is a good user can actually benefit from connect endpoint with network together. So that is really the key we can integrate the endpoint with networking with amount of management together which have a much better protection for the overall inside enterprise. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Daniel Ives from FBR Capital markets. Daniel, please go ahead. Jim Moore : Thanks. This is actually Jim Moore in for Daniel. Just a question about the cash balance. It's growing obviously in profitabilities fairly steady, so I guess just wondering what kind of appetite you guys have for M&A and if there's anything interesting out there that would be worthwhile for you? Andrew Del Matto : Hi Jim the way I would like to answer the question is maybe just talking about our capital strategy and our capital strategy has been to invest for growth that\u2019s largely been in sales and marketing over the last year or so, year and half I guess. And from what we could see that is the best return that we can give, I think you could see the growth in the top line and I also just we have share holders and investors and I think it is also falling through to the share price. So either from a return on capital perspective, we think that is a great investment, in terms of inorganic we constantly look out there, what are the challenging things is that security gets a lot of attention and so you\u2019re looking at some very high multiples and we\u2019re very disciplined on price and strategy and we want to look to things that can enrich our offerings over time but be accretive certainly over the shorter or near term because those are the things that tend to make sense. So we continue to evaluate, I am sure we will do something at some point kind of hard to predict that timing but we are going to be very disciplined in how and where we look and we have to be very consistent with our strategy and enrich value for our customers over time. Jim Moore : Okay. That was it from us. Thanks good quarter. Andrew Del Matto : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Okay. And our next question is from Aaron Schwartz from Macquarie. Aaron please go ahead. Aaron Schwartz : Hi. Good afternoon. I just had a quick question here. Given that the billings out performance relative to the product revenue out performance, are you seeing a different sort of attach rate with maybe the US enterprise sales? I know you touched on the bundling a little earlier. That didn't have much of an impact on the quarter, but it does seem like the attach rate on subscription is changing a little bit. I was wondering if you could just walk through that? Thanks. Andrew Del Matto : Yes fair Aaron. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen I mean it is hard to predict. I say Q1 is often a little bit lower product revenue mix wise I think than Q4, so if you are looking at sequentially I think there is always a bit of a step down to simply because keep such powerful spend out quarter for purchases from a calendar perspective for enterprises and companies as a whole. And so I think you get a bit of that in Q1, look I think it\u2019s certainly part of our strategy to enrich the subscriptions and charge more and build out decline, I think it is a little early to claim too much of a victory there quite honestly but I think mathematically if you just look at the accelerated pace as a natural fact you are just going to as you model it, you are going to end up deferring a little more because the mix, the lot of the growth ends up just falling into deferred revenue if you will being attributed to FortiCare and FortiGuard subscription services. Aaron Schwartz : I guess just a follow-up there. Was there any sort of change in renewal or anything else that would drive the deferred up if the subscription attach would change all that much? Andrew Del Matto : Can you repeat that please? Aaron Schwartz : I was just saying, sorry for the background, if the subscription attach rate is just moving slowly higher and there is certainly benefit longer term, I mean was there anything either on the renewal rates, core maintenance, or anything else to change? Because it was quite pronounced in terms of the booking subside. I'm just wondering what drove that to that degree? Thanks. Andrew Del Matto : No, I think we talk about our customer retention rate which is just the overall number of customers renewing and that is north of 90%, so that is good, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything overall, I think we I honestly I just think we\u2019re executing very well. Aaron Schwartz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jayson Nolan from Robert Baird. Jayson, please go ahead. Jayson Nolan : Okay. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the headcount add at the end of Q4. It would have been surprising to see that group contribute some in Q1, but I'm curious if they did and what the expectation is on full productivity. Is that kind of a 6-month target or 12-month target? It sounds like people are ramping faster than you expected. Andrew Del Matto : Well Jayson I think the last comment is probably the way to look at I think people are ramping better than expected I attributed to - I think we\u2019re very good at who we hire where we found our right profile if you will of experienced sales leaders and I think they\u2019re bringing in their teams whether it\u2019s team from their historical relationships or just how they onboard people. I think we\u2019re also getting the marketing right in terms of how we generate leads for them and then also how we onboard them and how they deliver our message I think that\u2019s just getting a lot better. And people are - sales people are getting the productivity faster than they had historically. I think it\u2019s a combination of those things. Now talking about people who were hired, I don\u2019t really look at people who are hired in December and how they performed in March don't speak, I think that\u2019s just too early in fact you look more at their funnel and are they developing well enough such that they\u2019re doing their job so to speak. And all those things look fine and that's it. I just think people are executing very well overall due to good leadership, good products, good marketing and good onboarding. Jayson Nolan : Okay. That makes sense. Ken, a question on kind of timing of refresh. I think we are going to start to go from the network processor to the content processor. Does that happen in this year and is the timing -- would that matter to revenue or is the CP less of an event than the MP? Ken Xie : MP definitely kind of improving the network speed interface speed quickly, especially in the firewall encryption. CP is more improving on the intrusion, on some other - some other content scanning performance. So we\u2019ll have a product come up in second half of the year leverage new CP, will be the CP9, probably the product announced in the second half of the year then we\u2019ll give some details. Jayson Nolan : Okay. Appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from Rohit Chopra from Buckingham. Go ahead sir. Rohit Chopra : Thanks very much. Hey, Drew, can't tell that you are feeling good about the quarter. I wanted to go back to the port strike real quickly. Product gross margins you mentioned port strike, the transit issue, so given that it is short-term in nature does it make sense to look for modest incremental upside as we move through the next few quarters? So that's my first question on gross margin and then second question related to E-rate and the education opportunity. As you know, the government is giving schools a lot of money and I know you guys get a lot of revenue from the education segment. We noticed that in California alone or why don't I just give you a total for the United States - you guys look like you may have an incremental $10 million of opportunity named in a whole bunch of education deals for 2015. Can you just give us your thoughts on E-rate and the potential opportunity there? Ken Xie : We do see the email coming, this is Ken, let Drew answer maybe first question. Andrew Del Matto : May be you want to go first Ken. Ken Xie : Yes that\u2019s where - that\u2019s most supporting infrastructure, we do see the need of some combined infrastructure with the security together so that\u2019s where offer like secured Wi-Fi instead of just the Wi-Fi connection there. So that's opportunity we see, because right now we\u2019re using FortiGate as a Wi-Fi controller so that's definitely will help in the school handle not only the better infrastructure but also better security. Andrew Del Matto : Yes, and Rohit, hopefully I\u2019m being appropriately factual in terms of how I characterize a quarter. The guidance - we\u2019ve given the guidance and I don\u2019t obviously we wouldn\u2019t want to expand on that too much. What I would say is that\u2019s, what I expressed in the past is that, on the good side, I think the positive things are that we seem to be ramping very nicely, the marketing investments seem to be paying off, the people seem to be performing very well. I think our messaging resonates not only from the NSS labs tests that we referenced but just from a, the notion of best-of-breed integrated platform, I think also resonates very well at the enterprise level. I think on the cautious side, look we\u2019re getting into bigger numbers, the compares are getting bigger year-on-year, we do have a lot of new people, and new processes in place and, I think we're being very appropriate in how we guide. Rohit Chopra : I was just trying to get you to slip up and give us a higher number. Michelle Spolver : Yes, right. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Zeller from Needham & Company. Scott, please go ahead. Scott Zeller : Hi. Thanks. Could you just give sort of a summary of where you are at the vertical sales force build-out strategy? You've referenced a number of times and we are pleased with results, but there were questions earlier around margin ramp in the second half of the year and specifically around sales and marketing. So could you just talk about how far you are into that build out of those teams and how it will affect sales and marketing throughout the balance of the year? Andrew Del Matto : Scott, I think we were about, I would say midway in our overall sales and marketing investments, I would call, I would characterize it as mid way. Verticals is the major component of that, I think we're through quite a bit of that part of the strategy from a sales capacity perspective but now we're layering in marketing, we're layering in the marketing side of that and so that, that\u2019s a bit of a an investment. The other investments we're making again are just investments continuing to scale the enterprise sales force globally and particularly in emerging markets and then also little bit in Asia where we probably have and invested as much as we would have liked, and you can see the results in Asia aren't quite keeping pace with the EMEA or the America\u2019s and so that\u2019s where we see the opportunity. I know it\u2019s a little broader answer but when I think about the margin I just think its, I think its, you really want to take a step back and look at the whole frame if you will. I would say and just in particular with verticals again it takes a little while to have that investment payoff, you\u2019re talking about bigger customers, lighthouse customers and each of those verticals. We saw a nice uptick in healthcare on one of the largest healthcare deals we\u2019ve ever closed and then some very nice traction in the federal space, where we closed several deals. Scott Zeller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing our final question from John Lucia from JMP Securities. Please go ahead sir. John Lucia : Hey, guys. Thanks for my questions. I have two questions. Ken, you referenced the internal server security opportunity ramping pretty well. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense for what inning we are in that opportunity, how long you think it'll take to become meaningful in terms of revenue, and then also what the competitive environment looks like there? Ken Xie : This is Ken. I think that's a new area beyond the primary security for enterprise is that still, like I said still in early stage, but we do see the customer, large interest and also want to spend money to provide multilayer security because it also depend on platform to handle the speed of internal security because internal security tend to be like 100 even thousand times faster than the parameter, the board of security because internal is all connected by the high speed switch. So you need to have a high speed deployment and also have to be easily replacing some of the switch, has to be very quick and also lot of things now depend on the fixed policy but all depend on the some merchant lending, some behavior-based what's normal, what's abnormal traffic kind of pattern to really manage that. So as this is still early and but you can see from the large enterprise for all this - like they see the important of security servers, security datacenter, security department there. I don't see much \u2013 pretty much no research for some research firm to address this one yet and but I do believe this is relatively additional market and as a new opportunity, we position well, well because the platform we have with ASIC accelerate beyond the CPU, which can have huge advantage before internally in the high speed environment. That\u2019s probably more - happen in the large enterprise right now and I think eventually they may expand into some mid enterprise even some data center service provider but is in early stage right now. John Lucia : Okay. Thank you. And then, Drew, I had one quick question. Can you quantify the one-time items in gross margin, the Port of Oakland, the increase in the price of the bundles? Andrew Del Matto : I think I share the price of bundles, I would characterize roughly a couple of million dollars. As far as the Port of Oakland, yes somewhere maybe somewhere slightly north of 300 to 500 K, kind of in the 300 to 500 K range. John Lucia : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Some of that carries into inventory still the way you do the accounting in some of the cost of the freight actually rolls into the inventory balance and so you pay for it over time let's just say. John Lucia : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Okay. Thank you. I'd now like to turn the program over to Michelle Spolver for any concluding remarks. Michelle Spolver : All right, thank you everybody. Thanks especially we had a busy day. We are having a busy week. So thanks for all your time today. For those of you who have additional questions, we will continue to do our second call at 3.30 PM, so feel free to call back there. And everybody who's at RSA will be there this week. Our booth number is 4400. Come by, come look at the technology and hopefully we will see lot of people there. That's it. That concludes our call today. Thank you very much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude this conference. You may now all disconnect and have a great day.",

(Broker) Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Q2 2015 Earnings Financial Analyst Q&A. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode, but shortly, we will go to Q&A session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now, I'll turn it over to your host, Michelle Spolver. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, everyone. Thank you for calling in again. Ken Xie and Andrew Del Matto are accompanying me on this call and before we start, it's an all Q&A session. Before we start, I have to remind you that remember the disclaimer I provided during our 1 :30 call earlier applies to any forward-looking statements we make during the second call. So with that, John, you can go ahead and open up the call for questions. Operator : First is coming from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen. Gregg, your line is open. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much. Hi guys, how are you? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Great. How are you Gregg? Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, doing well. Thanks very much and I guess, just a couple of follow-ups. Drew, obviously, your growth in seven-figure deals was very good. Can you see if there were any kind of mega deals in the quarter, sort of in that kind of $5 million or above-type range? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Not a lot, I mean I can't think of any off top of my head, maybe one. Yeah, it's not skewed like that. It's \u2013 the customers tend to buy over time I think, and so more characterized instead of frontloading purchases. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, perfect. And was also just kind of wondering if you guys are looking to bring on a new CMO, and if so, if that was likely to be an internal or external hire, I guess any color there would be that will be helpful. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. We are actively recruiting, interviewing the CMO candidate. We also will keep investing in the marketing and we're hiring in all the level. Actually, you can see the investment we had in the last few quarter in the marketing is actually starting to pay off. So it's a lot of lead gen, lot of event going on right now. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, Ken. And if I could just ask one last one. This is the second consecutive quarter in which you didn't buy back any stock after having done so in the prior five periods and I'm just wondering if you could update us on your buyback philosophy. Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure Gregg. It's true. Look, we're very focused on our growth, I mean that's our strategy right now to invest in growth. As we said, we'd be opportunistic on buyback. Obviously, it's hard to define that, but if you look at history, I think our average price of the \u2013 look roughly 79 million shares we brought back under the current program was \u2013 I think the average price was like $20.50. But right now, I would say, again, we'll obviously remain opportunistic, hard to define what that is, but we're clearly more focused on growth and buyback. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling, you're now open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Wanted to drill into two areas, Drew. First, the inventory turnover the 2.2 times, now that some of the port items and other things that were drags or concerns on inventory are behind us, is there anything that should prevent that from maybe trickling higher? I know your stated guidance is better than 2 times, but what would be the puts and takes that would either help that number elevate in the back half of the year or keep it constrained. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure, look as you said, I'll stick to the two times or better. But I think on the puts and takes side, it's really about forecast and timing, and timing if deals were to come forward or slip, I think that's what really drives it one way or the other. But I mean I'm kind of \u2013 we're comfortable with where we are and that's certainly not to imply that anything pulled into the quarter or anything like that, I wouldn't want you to take that away from that. It's not the case at all. But I think I like \u2013 I mean 2.2 times feels like a very comfortable number for us, but again, I would guide to two or better just \u2013 you can't \u2013 it's just hard to be that precise on forecasting inventory needs. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Sterling, this is Ken. We may have a little bit different business model than some of our competitors, the most server has slowed down (05:03) the standard server PC, because we, customer build, I think the FortiGate is the biggest \u2013 the super majority of (05:14) we have. So FortiGate is the moderate even some other appliances (05:17) we have the customer build with our own ASIC, so we did on a chip level or the system level and through the software application level there. So that's where we \u2013 all inventory need to be \u2013 because the lead time is longer and because there's no like readymade system for us. So we have to build up from the chip to the system to customize so far the solution we have. So that we need to keep in some large inventory. And also the inventory costs were low is whether the interest whatever, so that's where we compare to. So we have some model compared to the opportunity loss, we've short of inventory also compared to some inventory costs, so we feel true enterprise is a healthy multiple there, so that's why we're keeping that as the model we have. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. And then the second topic is I think Mike Turits asked you about kind of directionally just cash flow growth and should it grow in line with net income, and I didn't quite catch your answer. And I guess I would be surprised if it grew in line with net income, because just looking at the billings guidance and the revenue guidance, just the contribution you should get to cash flow from deferred revenue, shouldn't that make it a much higher growth rate in cash flow than net income? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I think you're right. Yeah. That's a good answer. I was thinking of the growth in billings, and basically, modeling changes in working capital. I guess maybe I perhaps misinterpreted the question, but that's how I was thinking about it. The top-line growth being, I thought I heard him say top-line, maybe I'm mistaken, but that's how I heard it, and I met more on the billing side, so kind of following the billings forecast, it grows billings. I mean that's the point right now, where cash flow outpaces the P&L, and you see margin compression simply because you defer so much. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Exactly. Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I see your point. I think that's right on Sterling, yeah, that's right on, but my apologies if I didn't answer that correctly. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, hello again guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Drew, I just wanted to zero in on FortiGuard and FortiCare billings, you mentioned on the call you had a tougher comp there this quarter, but you still manage to accelerate. I guess just a dig into that a little bit more, was it a particularly good renewal quarter, did maybe weighted average contract duration come in higher than you expected? Any color on that strength there would be helpful. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: No, look, just as I always remind people an easy way to kind of see the duration is just look at the percent of long term deferred as a percent of overall deferred. It's been ranging I think roughly about the same 32%, 33%. It hasn't changed in a while. So it's pretty consistent duration. And in terms of renewals, no, it's not an abnormal quarter at all one way or the other. We don't allow people to pull in renewals, for instance. We wouldn't pay on it. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. So it sounds like just better attach rate and perhaps a little bit of that pricing impact maybe having an impact in (08:37). Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, a little bit of that, but I think just good execution all around, people definitely having a nice take on the bundles. It does \u2013 I think clearly enterprise customers are clearly buying the bundles and we're doing a lot of enterprise deals. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then not to revisit the Meru question again, but I guess just curious, is it fair to think about the majority of their support revenue being written down post close, and then, similarly, I guess as you integrate those sales teams for a much more of a combined effort, how do you think about any potential expense synergies? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, first of all, they've been through a quite a bit of disruption over the last year. I think they've had multiple restructurings and they were still losing money. Again, we're trying to pull it in to fit our model. We're being very selective strategically in terms of our strategy, which is to basically drive a secure WiFi offering, and then, basically, cross-sell our products FortiGate and FortiGuard and FortiCare products ultimately into their installed base. So yeah, we're rationalizing what's there. We've \u2013 not everybody came over. We're clearly making sure that we take a step back and ensure as just in good hygiene as we do, where every quarter we're looking at what makes sense for us and what doesn't make sense and we're really \u2013 as I've said, it's an integrated business. We're really stepping back and looking at the whole, what does it take to be successful in the future versus going out and trying to cherry pick of things here and there. That's the right way to do an integration, make sure you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak and make sure that you get the value out of the case you're looking for, which is an enriched integrated wireless solution. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also the supporting revenue is wire's small percentage. I think it's probably 10% to 20%, it's because they only have this like supporting for the deployment and whatever (10:40) they don't have any subscription like we have on the FortiGate. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, we're not accounting on a lot of that at all. I think look, they're going through the opening balance sheet stuff right now, the accountants and they just don't figure that out, but obviously, as you said gets haircut. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Just immaterial (10:54). Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And then lastly, if I could squeeze it in, I guess, Ken, you had mentioned sort of the new content processors sort of coming over the next six months to 12 months, how should we think about that conceptually in terms of rollout by appliance. Is this something that starts with the low end and works its way up to the high-end or does it start at the high end and work its way down? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think the network processor is more starting from the high-end and then the ASIC more starting from the low-end, but the content processor pretty much apply to all the \u2013 from high to the low to mid range, as more follow what's the next whatever the FortiGate pipeline was going to come out. So we just replaced the CP8 with CP9, that's improving like the performance like few hundred percent on the content, on the scan on SSL. That's probably the CP9 tend to be is a core processor next to the CPU as compared to the MPEs (11:57) more accelerated interface level. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: (11:59). Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: And the ASIC is more applied to the low end. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much guys. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey guys. I've got a couple of questions just now regarding things like duration or big deals. I think what we're trying to get to is whether or not \u2013 obviously, that's a huge quarter, is there anything that we should really think of as having been exceptional in this quarter? Or another way of thinking of it is there anything should we then think of given what you just did, should we think of normal seasonality going forward or is it not, it was somewhat exceptional? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: It's not huge deal. It's really, I think, the overall performance of enterprise sector there, so this is really like we did last quarter sort of like 70%, this quarter and 90%. I think the team is starting to get on board and they're more mature. At the same time, we're keeping investing in the marketing and some other what will helping. Also, I see the Internal Segmentation that's other \u2013 that also write-down (13:06) to become the sweet spot for the enterprise, because a lot of enterprise also see the need for the Internal Segmentation. So Internal Segmentation, that's probably the one \u2013 is the new, but as we don't have much data, I don't see any other data from analysts yet, but we feel the big enterprise really badly need this kind of solution to secure internally. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, Michael and there's just a good standard distribution across the deal size, so it's not \u2013 we answered the earlier question, there's not like a large deal or two driving the growth at all, that's not the case. I mean think of it, we added 9,000 customers, I think in the quarter. And it's very consistent, it's a very run rate \u2013 it seems to be very run rate oriented business. And we seem to pick up steam as the sales reps come up to productivity and they've just quite honestly continued to overperform. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So in theory, normal quarter-to-quarter seasonality should apply. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. But again, you just have \u2013 yeah. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Yeah. There is nothing \u2013 there was nothing \u2013 no one-offs or anything this quarter that would sort of change seasonality for next quarter. And then, the other thing I want to highlight is deals, while we didn't have any big mega deal or one-off deal, the deal then for the $1 million range, which we never actually given the percentage before, but we saw really good growth in the $1 million and above. So more $1 million plus deals than we've ever done with 133% year-over-year improvement, but again, there wasn't a big mega deal that drove that. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then what's the status of the ERP implementation I figure out how much of that is going to cost over what period of time and is that you're non-GAAPing that out of the expense point of view I believe, but where we're seeing that on the cash flow statement, is it CapEx or is it somewhere... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: It's in CapEx. Yeah, it's all. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: It's all on CapEx? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: There is some in OpEx too. Basically, the non-run rate portion is the pro forma piece of the non-GAAPing. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right, because if you're non-GAAPing that as the note says, some of that has to be \u2013 nothing capitalized in there. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. It's the non-recurring piece you're doing you basically have an investment and some consultants and that goes away when the project goes away. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. So can you just... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: The design work, yes. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: ...- when is the project over and how much is in CapEx, how much is in OpEx over what period? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We should be over roughly around this time next year and then I think \u2013 and we set $40 million to $45 million for the year in CapEx, how much for the ERP? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: $5 million. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, for the year, kind of $5 million or $6 million is then this year in the CapEx piece, yeah. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: $40 million to $45 million is your CapEx and $5 million to $6 million of it is the ERP? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, $5 million to $6 million of the $40 million to $45 million is ERP in FY 2015. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then how much is OpEx that's not being capitalized that's being non-GAAPed out? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, it's about $5 million. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Another $5 million. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: And-a-half, it's about 50%-50%, think about it that way. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, on APAC, so just if you review what I mean for us why the growth has been so much slower in APAC and what's your China exposure and is that any part of the issue? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: China is very small, probably less than couple percent is \u2013 so that's where \u2013 and also in the other part of APAC, we feel we need to hurry investing in growth quickly. So that's like us a little bit behind. That's where we need to keep investing in the growth in APAC. But China is a very small part of it. I don't think that there would be any material impact to us. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. That's it from me. Thanks. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you. So we'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter, your line is open. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. On the G&A expense, it looks like you had a pretty significant uptick there. I think we're non-GAAPing out the ERP, but was there anything driving that specifically that should be highlighted? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, probably. We had just a small spike in legal fees probably this quarter. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And are those, the things continue at that level? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Hard to predict, but I would just, I think it's probably fair to hold the percentage, G&A percentage where it is. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Can you tell us what matter that relates to? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Just multiple. We've been running through them, I wouldn't highlight anything particularly, Walter. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. And then... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We've been kind of running through, yeah. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just on the \u2013 you highlighted your average buyback pricing in low-$20s, you mentioned you're using your cash for growth. I guess the way I look at it, you're certainly able to fund your growth organically, you're profitable, you're not burning cash from operations. So as we think about using cash to fund growth, with such a substantial amount on the balance sheet, is that a cash used for acquisitions or it just doesn't seem necessary that you would actually hold the cash to fund growth given profitability levels? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, look, again, we're focused on growth, that's our strategy. We could use some of it, obviously, for M&A, if that makes sense, Walter, but again, we're fundamentally focused on our growth. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, just lastly, on sales and marketing spend, I think Sterling asked this on the call, on the first call. It feels like your spending actually decelerates a bit in the fourth quarter based on your guidance. We note that your sales and marketing spend a year ago really picked up in the fourth quarter and there's a bit of a \u2013 you're anniversarying that now at this point, should we, I guess can you just talk us through sort of how you think about sales and marketing through this year and is that part of what looks like a more level \u2013 OpEx level between Q3 and Q4? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, look, as we said, I mean I think the self adjusting side of expenses, obviously, are the COGS side and also commission self-adjust with the number a little bit. We continue to invest and we're sticking to get the 14%. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the Internal Segmentation Firewall. Ken, it's been a topic we've heard about from the industry for a while, it does seem like it's very nascent. It's typically described as software to monitor east-west traffic. I don't know that I've heard of an appliance, certainly not a custom ASIC based appliance given the throughput required. But maybe if you could detail that a little more versus the software-only approach? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. The software-only or some other, they called the sandbox or detection, that's in the TAP mode, it's not a inline device. So they can detect that's what so far internally they do deploy a lot of detection device, our detection software on the server, but as the firewall is the only device, inline can take action and do the prevention. So that's where a lot of like bridge or whatever the company, they do have the detection like a Sony, like all they do deploy some latest software to do the detection, but there's too many like (21:36) anything about it. The key is really have the inline device take the actions to prevent the attack and also deploy internally like security department, like whether the finance or engineer or sales whatever. So it's internal segment, even department, also protect the server that's relatively new, and it's the inline device. It's not just the detection tapping device, which don't need to be inline. So that's different than before. The inline devices have to match and keep up the internal network speed. You cannot slow down the internal traffic and also has to be reliable enough and that don't bring down the network. So that's different than the traditional detection and also different than the perimeter security, which is connected with Internet. The Internet traffic is much, much slower, like we say, it's a 10x to 100x slower than the internal network speed. So that's the challenge, need to be very fast, need to be inline and also need to be very low latency, while it's better for the server. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Is it logical that a company could have more Internal Segmentation appliances than a perimeter facing firewall? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Still the cost, I have to say, today, if you look at whether per 10-gig or per gig, the firewall cost is 50 times to 100 times higher than the switch. So it's really \u2013 some company, they may have more budget, they start and deploy more Internal Segmentation, but it's more dependent on the budget and also dependent on how they want to manage it together. I'd say, if they have more budget, they probably definitely will \u2013 some bigger enterprise, we're starting to see \u2013 starting like implement and also some time, made mandatory to the Internal Segmentation, but is \u2013 some other enterprise not there yet. It's a more budget sense, but this is new. It's really the (23:42) new, we don't see it before to deploy internally and we're high-speed inline device. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's interesting. And then a follow-up on a couple of sales exec hires. I think the gentleman from NetApp is going to be running the finance vertical. Would he have counterparts then in tech and healthcare also? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: He will more focus on enterprise and especially the media enterprise all this together and that's the area he knows the best. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And he was added if he wasn't replacing a previous salesperson. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes, you're right. Yeah, we need to keep adding sales capacity and same time keeping improved model and also keep improving the marketing and the (24:36) pipeline. And also, it's growing from like today $1 billion to like a multi-billion dollar. That we also need to keep improving a lot of \u2013 on the process, on the system, on the team level. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks a lot. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is open. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Hi everyone, it's Fatima on for Brent Thill. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a few on go-to-market. Just with respect to go-to-market and the America as the approach sales verticalization has been very successful and I'm curious kind of given the mandate to build sales capacity internationally, to what extent you're actually thinking about porting over the U.S. model internationally and if that would make sense and then I have a couple of follow-ups. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Probably what depend \u2013 in some country like some big country in Europe, we may starting to do some verticalization and divide by the vertical. It really depends on which model is more efficient. Some smaller country or region, they probably based on the regional as the model like we did early maybe better, but some larger, we may starting dividing the vertical. It's difficult to say which one we were... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: There's global coordination on the verticals though is the good way to think about it. They're regionally based teams, but they worked on stuffs like global accounts. I think as you get down the lift in terms of size, in any of those verticals, that's where you would have more of the regional orientation. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I agree, but like Joe said, we're starting to have some global accounts that will be more managed by like... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, the big names are global. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Fair enough. And I know there is also an emphasis around building out to the midmarket and channel focused investments, and you mentioned that you did make some additional hires in that space. I'm wondering what's kind of on their roadmap. Is it more marketing event, is it more pipeline building activities, additional discipline around building or improving forecasting in the midmarket? I just wanted to get a sense of how exactly you're building up the midmarket and your channel relationships with your recent investments? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's all of that you mentioned and also we are hiring at all level and including the CMO, actually we're recruiting them even right now is we feel that the marketing will be very important for the media enterprise, and we keep investing in this year, that's where we're way behind with some more competitor. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I would just add that it's probably a slightly different sales interaction and marketing interaction, even sales engineer interaction in the midmarket versus the top end where you're doing a lot of testing. I think reputation in the mid-market is going to matter more in the mid-market. And so, we want to make sure that we're developing. We're ceding that reputation and we're growing that and then making sure we're communicating with people in the right way in that market. It tends to be more like that some of the \u2013 I would say probably higher level of social marketing, if you will, then perhaps at the top end. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, (27:58) play more important role in that enterprise market there. At the same time, we also see, I think like I mentioned, a couple of weeks ago, we announced a couple of new products in the mid range. There is a few more to come out in the next few months. That's all help enhance the mid-market growth. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : And does that imply you're sun-setting kind of your historical mid range SKUs, I imagine you're referring to the 400D and 900D that you announced a few weeks ago, but just curious what happens to the existing line-up and if you're just going to sun-setting those, then rolling these into the lineup? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, these are probably the latest version that's where some of the middle ranges not quite using the latest MP6 yet, so we are going to use MP6 more in the middle range and come up with some new product there. So that's what accelerate the performance and also are helping position even stronger in the mid enterprise. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : And a last couple from me, if I may, just regarding the bundling. So you have talked a lot about that 10% price increase that was in effect as of January. I mean presumably, this was for the new customers that you're onboarding, but I'm wondering how the price increase process works for existing customers, if you're kind of transitioning them in the bundle direction where previously they were just buying a la carte services and if there's sort of a dollar net expansion happening at time of renewal with the existing customers? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. It's probably more kind of fixed some of the things we have before. If you look and in the \u2013 like UTM bundle, we offer full service, like from anti-malware and the intrusion, including app control and also anti-spam and the web filter, each is about 20%. And then also, we added like by file (29:54) supporting us 15%. So if you look on the previous UTM bundle, you have four services, each about 20% and then you add 15% on the supporting, that's we're only selling for like 45% that's way low. So we turn it to 55%. It's more fixed and in some sense we not quite bundle the right before, but like I said, is a \u2013 we're more focused on offer improving the services, so that's what ATP and also the new mobile security we feel eventually will help customer add additional value, so instead of try to changing some of the pricing in the past. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Let me boil that down. I think, look the \u2013 a small tailwind in Q2 for that action, I think if you're talking about going forward, I think your question was on the installed base, I think you're basically asking, what do they renew at? They do get the increase \u2013 your ability to get that though is somewhat challenge. A lot of people lock that piece of the budget in. So it really takes a while to cycle through that. You're doing it more on new customers than renew even though that's what the quote will say where that ends up maybe a slightly different place, so quite frankly. And so that's a little bit of why you kind of end up with a minimal impact near term. But it's good to think about longer term, and then, yeah, I think to the extent that if we have 235,000 customers, they don't all have bundles, that's something we clearly look at as a growth factor going forward in a way to ensure that we're \u2013 when we see a renewal or we see a customer, we open that door to sell them something else. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : And a very last one from me, if I could. Just wanted to clarify again that you are expecting to do another round of increases on prices in the back half of this year and I'm just curious as to how widespread this will be within the portfolio. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: No, we are not planning any price increases and none is planned. We feel the current price is reasonable. What we're going to offer is additional service, additional subscription service like a mobile security service. So customer, whatever they have the current bundle price, they still can buy it. We're not increasing and just additional new service that's also could be a different bundle. Whatever the bundle have today, we're keeping there and also the same price. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : That's it from me. Thank you very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Melissa Gorham from Morgan Stanley. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Hi guys. Just one quick one for you, for Drew. I'm just wondering to the extent that you're selling more virtualized appliances, is there any implication from a gross margin perspective that we should think about as you ship more virtualized form factors versus hardware? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, obviously, software has a higher margin. So you know it's not a material part of our business there, Melissa, that's the problem. And again, I \u2013 to remind everybody, we've kind of guided for the year, so the 14% is the right number, but theoretically, you're correct. The problem is just not a major part of the top-line, yes. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then I just wanted to quickly just drill down on the public sector given that we're getting into the September quarter. Today, you announced another certification with the public sector. I'm just kind of broadly wondering if you could give us an update on how your government business is performing and what the opportunity is there? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. I think the OPM breach highlights a bit of the opportunity. I think we hired a vertical team there, a smaller investment than in the healthcare and financial services, because we already had a government team or fed team, but we augmented that with the new leader back in \u2013 I think October-November of last year, and that team is doing better. We've given guidance for Q3, obviously, and obviously, September being the year-end, that's reflected in there, but we do feel like we're getting more looks anyway from the government. We asked this question as a team, obviously, it's an obvious question, and they felt that they were getting a better presence and better attention in the government than they had in the past, and clearly, OPM piece being a part of it and I think part of the comment they made was that there's a lot of the longer-term legacy providers installed there, and they seem to be at risk or more risk than they've been. And there was a high resistance to change in the past, but clearly, the breach and I think that is why the breach matters, I think it stimulates some rethinking of the architectures. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. That's it from me. Operator : Thank you. So we'll take our next question from Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Catharine, your line is open. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. Could you give us a service provider split out from the earlier call? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Catharine, do you want the vertical \u2013 the percentage of... Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Yes. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: It's 22% for Q2, I think 23% Q1. I think it's probably in the last few quarters around 22%, 23%. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. So in Q2, we've 22% of total billings. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. And then my question is you did a lot of discussion on the internal firewall and what I'm trying to understand in that aspect as you invest in your R&D, are you looking at identity and management as another product extension, complementary to where the internal firewalls are? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Some of that, but I feel the internal more try to stop the intrusion of malware as there's not quite access \u2013 access a lot of times still goes with the perimeter of firewall, but the internal is really where high-speed is how to prevent some of the malware, some of the \u2013 it's more likely some of data leakage prevention kind of things. It's not quite in the \u2013 the management then is very important, so we have good partner with some other vendor. They do a lot of data analysis as in a management, so that's where we're working more closely with them, but is not quite in the authentication or access control yet. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then you know earlier in the year and last year there was a big issue with the port contracts in the LA area. And at any point did you switch some of your shipment directly to Europe and not to the U.S.? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, that's probably \u2013 we like kind of have tried to pull in some inventory ahead of the time, that's causing the Q1 inventory a little bit higher. But over the year, the issue has come down now, as I think it's starting kind of very normal now. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Good (37:06) today guys. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, just a quick follow-up. When you look at the guidance for the September quarter, I think we're looking at some acceleration in terms of the revenue lines, just curious which of the revenue line should see the biggest acceleration in the subscription area or the product area? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, we don't guide that way, Sterling. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. So ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back to your host for any concluding remarks. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Look, thanks everybody for your attention and again your support. We really appreciate it and look forward to talking to all of you soon. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

Thanks Michelle, and I hope everyone can hear me okay. And thank you for joining the call today to discuss our third quarter 2015 results. I'm pleased to share that for the third consecutive quarter of this year, Fortinet accelerated billings growth to a record level, deliver 41% billings growth. So this is approximately four times the current growth rate of the network security market, and at the highest growth rate, we have ever achieved as a public Company. Our technology advantage is very strong and our growth strategy is working. Our Q3 business was driven by ongoing healthy security spending environment to defend against an increasing array of sophisticated security attacks, companies continue to invest in upgrading and expanding their network infrastructure and selecting Fortinet's high-performance best-in-class integrated platforms. During the quarter, we won deals with some of the world's largest enterprise, finance institutions and service providers. This type of customers require the best product and perform the most stringent testing for their complex security environment. Time and time again, Fortinet outperform competitors with a superior technology and unmatched level of performance, validation of this is in our managed and products' application and recommendations. We also continue to see strong enterprise demand, we deployed high-speed FortiGate appliance as an internal segmentation firewall to help protect the key network resources from attack that get past prime-tech defences or come from within. This more high performance that is required for the internal firewall deployment is something Fortinet offered better than anyone else. And the ability to deploy our solution in a transparent or switch mode to enhance, not disrupt, the existing network security architecture is enabling expansion opportunity for our installed base and is also opening door with competitive account. In the third quarter, sales of our FortiSandbox advanced server protection appliance increased to record level, more than tripling year over year. On the ATP front, beyond just our NSS recommend FortiSandbox appliance, Fortinet has a strong advantage in our ability to offer ATP frame work not integrate FortiSandbox with 40-gig next-generation firewall, Fortinet email security, FortiWeb Web application firewall, and Fortify and from security product with our world-class solutions team to detect, correlate, stop near the threat and the parameter internal Internet, and Web, and end point. Customer want less competitive and a true integration and competition between multiple protection systems. Just some of the many that we win during the quarter including a seven-figure deal with a large U.S. based service provider, a Fortune 100 U.S. technology service company, a well-known U.S. federal government entity and a large Asian Pacific city government. Fortinet has a comprehensive platform of products and services to protect the cloud to the client and the network point in between. So a strong partner ecosystem, which can be seen on Slide 3, we can tightly integrate and interoperate at our major relation, SDN, cloud, secured analytics and the new vendors. During Q3, we enhanced and expand our ecosystem to include deeper partnership with VMWare through the NSX with addition with the FortiGate VMX 2.0. This complements Fortinet's internal technician [ph] power strategy that enhances the security culture of micro-segmentation in the data center. We also broadened our partnership with Cisco to integrate the FortiGate next-generation firewall into Cisco ACS software-defined network architecture. And we entered into new technology into our ability partnership with Splunk and our recent network, as well as a technology integration and a sales partnership with Capgemini and NTT. All of these partnership broaden our market opportunity and make it easy for customer to secure the multivendor, multilayer networks. Fortinet has a clear technology advantage and a strong and innovative road map in place to help us continue to strengthen our market position. In addition to new product and software that will expand our advantage and opportunities, our soon to be released FortiASIC quantum processing line or widen Fortinet's performance path even further. Our eyes are set on the continued growth and innovation, and I feel confident about our road ahead. Now I will turn the call to Drew to further review our Q3 financial results and provide outlook for the remainder of the year. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. Fortinet executed well during the third quarter, and our investment strategy continues to pay-off. Our billings growth accelerated to 41%, making this the third consecutive quarter that we've delivered record growth as a public Company. Fortinet is one of very few companies with over $1 billion run rate that is achieving this level of impressive growth. It's noteworthy that we're also maintaining sensible profitability and significant free cash flow. During Q3, we continued to execute our strategy of acquiring first seats at enterprise tables and landed several marquee deals with some of the largest, most savvy enterprise customers in the world. All of these customers have vast infrastructures and provide abundant expansion opportunities for Fortinet in the future. Let me now share with you our financial results for the third quarter, which can be seen on Slide 4. As I just mentioned, Fortinet's billings increased 41% year-over-year to $300 million, exceeding our guided range of $285 million to $295 million. Total revenue of $260 million was up 35% year-over-year, and was at the high end of our guided range of $255 million to $260 million. And our deferred revenue balance increased to $707 million, up 41% year-over-year, in line with our billings growth. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margins were 14% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.14, both exceeding our guidance. As expected, we continued to invest in line with our strategy to drive growth as we successfully absorbed the costs associated with the Meru integration yet still delivered additional margin upside to shareholders. And finally, our cash generation was strong, as evidenced by the $52 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter. This continues to demonstrate Fortinet's ability to generate a significant amount of cash, while at the same time investing for future growth. Our quarterly performance continued to reflect a robust security market, as the number and sophistication of network security threats continues to grow. This is illustrated by the various high profile attacks which highlight increasing corporate responsibility and accountability to protect information. As a result, security remains a critical IT investment priority, and as Ken stated, companies are demanding a proven, best-in-class integrated security platforms like Fortinet's. In Q3 we added approximately 8000 new customers to our base of more than 250,000 customers. We continued to land deals with new Fortune 100 customers, which is key to our long-term growth strategy. These large enterprises represent significant opportunity for cross-sell and upsell, as they purchased more products and services over time, yielding substantial lifetime value. A few deals landed with new customers included several wins with new financial services customers, both in the U.S. and internationally. In particular, our largest win of the quarter was a multimillion dollar, multi-phase deal with a large U.S.-based financial firm. Fortinet was chosen for a branch-to-core deployment to replace the incumbent provider at the Company's data centers and each of its thousands of branch locations. This customer conducted in-depth testing and chose Fortinet due to our ability to provide a combination of better security, scalability, and networking features than competitors could deliver. Additionally, we also landed deals with two of the most recognizable technology brands in the world, both of which were competitive replacement deals. One of these deals was with a multibillion-dollar Fortune 25 company that chose Fortinet due to our ability to provide a comprehensive security solution, which included our FortiGate, FortiSandbox, FortiMail, and FortiAuthenticator products. The other deal was to provide a high-speed network firewall for an extremely well-known technology brand. Gaining first seats at both of these very large companies provides significant future expansion opportunity. These are just a few of the many deals that Fortinet landed during the quarter. We continue to win initial seats at some very large tables, and are also expanding nicely within existing accounts. This is due to the strength and performance of our integrated technology platform and stronger sales and marketing efforts. Fortinet has a broad solution portfolio that enables us to address all phases of the attack cycle. We prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate the most sophisticated threats. Our offering allows us to do this at the network perimeter, interior, end point and numerous points in between through a common operating system and the ability to communicate across the entire platform. This provides us lucrative expansion opportunities to cross-sell additional products over time, which is key to our lifetime value model and the long-term growth, and profitability goals. To this point, a few of the many expansion deals closed during Q3 included one of the largest and most recognizable investment banks in the world that we landed just last quarter after being selected over competitors for a multiphase enterprise-wide next generation firewall refresh project. During Q3, we expanded within this account to win another piece of business to deploy our FortiGate appliances as internal segmentation firewalls for added layers of threat protection for its mission-critical network. We also expanded in another North American bank that will now be replacing its legacy firewalls from a competitor with Fortinet's solutions, three of its large data centers. And we won some expansion deal with one of the world's largest international banks which purchased our FortiGate high-end data center appliances and employ products for end-to-end security, scalability, reliability, and high performance. On the service provider front, we expanded with several Tier 1 providers, including two of the largest and most recognizable names in the world. Both of these companies have been customers of Fortinet for more than eight years, and spent more than $100 million within that time. The first customer we won a multimillion dollar deal to protect network backbone for its numerous hosted data centers around the world. While competitors were considered, none could provide the performance, scalability, management or proven track record that Fortinet delivered. In the second deal, we won a multiyear expansion project with a telecommunications company that is migrating its firewall infrastructure from an acquired subsidiary and replacing competitive offerings with Fortinet's. As Ken mentioned, sales of our FortiSandbox ATP appliances more than tripled year-over-year. And the number of deals were cross-sell opportunities with existing FortiGate customers. Finally, I also want to highlight that we had numerous, large subscription and support renewable deals with existing Fortinet customers. Our renewal rates, which attract by appliances are customers remain in the mid-70% range, and exclude product refresh and upgrade purchases. As we said earlier, our customer retention rate is above 90%, which demonstrates overall customer satisfaction as well as the stickiness of our solutions. Our high renewal and retention rates also show that we are not only winning numerous customers from the company, but we are keeping them. During Q3, we were pleased with our large deal metrics as a number of deals over $1,000 grew 59% and deals over $1 million grew 55%. Our breakdown of billings across our top five verticals remained relatively consistent, with service provider at 22%, government at 12%, financial services at 11%, education at 10% and retail at 6%. Geographically, year-over-year billings growth was strong across all regions. Americas billings grew 36%, EMEA billings grew 50% and APAC grew 36%. We are pleased with our growth in the Americas, given some economic headwinds from Canada, which is experiencing a slowdown. During the quarter, the pace of wins with large strategic enterprise customers continued nicely and we closed deals with 11 of the U.S. Fortune 25 companies. We also experienced strong performance from U.S. service provider segment, where we closed a number of seven-figure expansion deals. In EMEA we delivered another exceptional quarter, and our impressive 50% growth was driven by strong performance across all regions. Earlier investments and upgrading sales and channel partners continue to bring attractive returns. We have an experienced high quality team in place in EMEA who is executing extremely well. And in APAC our growth doubled over Q2 and we saw very strong performance from Japan as well as Korea and India. We continue to believe APAC presents a large growth opportunity for us. We started to benefit from the investments we've made, and will continue to make in expanding and upgrading our sales force. Turning to billings by product segment on Slide 7, we continue to see diversity of product billings across all segments. Our high-end FortiGate products accounted for 38% of total product billings. Our midrange enterprise products accounted for 26%. And our entry level products accounted for 36%. As a reminder, our product billings mix varies quarter-to-quarter based on the model to product to make up all size deals. And one quarter does not make a trend. Total revenue was $260 million during the third quarter, up 35% year-over-year and at the high end of our guided range. Revenue performance was driven by the combination of 36% year-over-year product revenue growth and 33% year-over-year services revenue growth. This was our highest revenue growth rate achieved in the past three years. While we're not breaking out the small amount of revenues associated with Meru, it should be noted that Q3 included the contribution from the acquisition since the July 8 close date. On a geographic basis, you can see on Slides 8 and 9 that revenues continue to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. In the Americas, revenues grew 38% to $113 million. EMEA revenues grew 39% to $92 million. And APAC revenues grew 23% to $55 million. Moving to non-GAAP expenses and profitability. During the third quarter, consolidated total non-GAAP gross profit margins were 74%, which was above our guided range of 70% to 71%. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 63%, the highest in several quarters. Non-GAAP service gross margins were 83%, highlighting the recurring nature and margin expansion value of our FortiGuard and FortiCare subscription offerings. Non-GAAP gross margins were positively impacted by higher sales of software products, such as our VM line of virtualized security solutions. Non-GAAP gross margins also benefited from the impact of recent price increases to our FortiGuard security subscriptions, as well as inventory management efficiencies. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $156 million during the third quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $36 million, or 14% of total revenue, and above our guidance. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $24 million, or $0.14 per share based on 178 million diluted shares outstanding, and also ahead of our guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 35%. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP financials can be seen on Slides 14 and 15. As seen on Slide 11, we ended Q3 with a strong balance sheet, including $1.17 billion in cash and investments, up from $1.148 billion at the end of Q2. The increase was primarily driven by the $65 million in cash generated from operations, which was partially offset from the cash used for the acquisition of Meru. As previously mentioned, free cash flow was $52 million in the third quarter. Our continued strong cash flow reflects our ability to both reinvest in the Company to support growth while also generating cash that will benefit future growth. Annualized inventory turns for Q3 were 2.1, in line with our annualized goal of 2 or better. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $707 million, up $207 million, or 41% year over year, and $49 million sequentially. Now, let me finish with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements, including all of the guidance statements provided, are subject to Michelle's cautions at the start of this call. Fortinet's market opportunity and technology advantage is significant, and our investments are paying off. We are succeeding in laying the foundation for our future as we scale Fortinet to be a multibillion-dollar business. We've more than tripled our growth rate over the past two years, and have reported record billing growth for the past four quarters. And while we have almost doubled the size of our sales force with experienced quality salespeople, our investments in marketing are in earlier innings and we still have some work to do. With new marketing leadership and focus on improved systems and profits in coming quarters, our investments in sales and marketing should result in continued improvements in market awareness, lead generation, and sales enablement. Additionally, while the network security market remains healthy and Fortinet's competitive position is extremely strong, we are nonetheless facing continued uncertainty in Canada, as well as in Brazil and other emerging markets, which could impact our business. For these reasons, we are approaching Q4 with cautious optimism. During Q4, we expect billings to be in the range of $364 million to $369 million, up approximately 30% year over year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $293 million to $298 million, up 32% year over year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% to 72%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 16%, reflecting improved leverage while continuing to invest to drive growth. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.18 to $0.19, based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 179 million to 181 million fully diluted shares. For the full year 2015, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.215 billion to $1.220 billion, up 36% year over year at the midpoint, and above our guidance range provided in July. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.006 billion to $1.011 billion, up 31% year over year at the midpoint, and also up from our prior guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to remain in the range of 71% to 72%. And we are maintaining our non-GAAP operating margin guidance of approximately 14%. We've shown leverage in our operating model, and our growth strategy is working. We believe our investments will benefit us long-term from a customer lifetime value perspective. Our original 2015 guidance anticipated operating margin improvements throughout the year, and we've delivered and expect to continue to deliver on this. And finally, we\u2019re maintaining our prior non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, and expect it to be in the range of approximately $0.51 per share to $0.52 per share, based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 176 million to 178 million fully diluted shares. In closing, I'd like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that, Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator, you may start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I am showing numerous questions and first coming from Brent Thill from UBS. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Just as it relates to last quarter, you had a material upside above the high end of the guide, and this quarter you came in at the high end of the guide. Was there anything that changed that you saw in the quarter, whether it was geographically or competitively, that may have caused that difference relative to Q3 versus Q2? Michelle Spolver : Revenue. You're talking about revenue, Brent, right? Not billings? Brent Thill : That's right. Drew Del Matto : Yes. Fair enough, Brent. Yes, on the billing side I think we over performed a bit. So that's like fine. Look, I think just the revenue, it's a little harder to predict. Part of it was just simply as you raise prices you end up carving out more per billings dollar, quite frankly, because the price is higher and you reflect more of the overall deal value, say the invoice value, to deferred revenue than revenue. And I think that's a piece of it. But there was nothing else there that I can point to that really had any effect on the revenue side. But it came in at the high end of guidance, didn\u2019t quite pick up all the benefit you saw in the billing side. But I\u2019d attribute it to just small amounts of just different -- kind of the accounting difference, if you will. Brent Thill : Okay. And appreciate the billings comment. Just when you look at the backlog that you saw in this quarter, no real change in terms of the overall spending appetite or close rates that you've been seeing historically everything continued in Q3 at the rate that you've being seeing in the first half of the year? Drew Del Matto : Yes. I mean, look, just start with EMEA. I mean 50% growth is, I think, outstanding. We're very proud of that. I think the fact that we grew, I think, what 33% in APAC, which is almost double the rate of growth, and really just due to investments there really over the last six months. I think these are things we are proud of. When you kind -- when you come closer to home, clearly the security demand environment hasn't changed. I heard one of our competitors say that everything goes out to RFP anymore because it's a board-level conversation. That's absolutely the case. I think the -- clearly the deals are there, that's our opportunity. The only thing we point to in terms of where we saw kind of a bit of a soft spot was probably Canada. Clearly we would have liked to see them perform a little better. But I think that's just due to their economic situation up there. That was really the point. And then looking forward, we pointed that out. And I think we're also being somewhat cautious about just emerging markets in general, given the economic situation in any commodity based economy. Ken Xie : Canada and Brazil. Brazil also. Drew Del Matto : Yes. Brazil I think we pointed out in the script, yes, specifically. But I would say Latin America could be even a tougher place. We haven't seen that yet in Latin America. Latin America had a decent quarter, quite frankly. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. Gray, your line is open. Gray Powell : Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just some pricing. How has the UTM bundled price increases that you implemented at the start of the year impacted billings? And then has that worked its way through the entire customer base yet? Drew Del Matto : It helps a little bit on the billings. It helps -- what it does is it helps on the deferred revenue, which I was just explaining to Brent, Gray. So it rolls into revenue over time because you have a higher -- if you look at the overall deal value, so to speak, a higher percentages is now attributed to the undelivered element or the subscriptions and support which you deliver over 12 months or longer. I think you get a little bit of pricing uplift over time. Clearly that's a piece of the growth, I think. I don't have a specific number for you, but I would consider it a tailwind. I don't think it's a major tailwind. But I think it's a tailwind. I think it still takes time to work its way all the way through. We're doing a lot of larger deals with installed base customers. We saw quite a bit of that activity. It's hard to instill that price increase just upfront. That's something that rolls in over time. And so we hope to get that benefit over the longer term. Gray Powell : Okay. That's helpful. And then, on Meru, I know you don't want to quantify the revenues, but can you maybe help us think through the impact on operating margins in Q3? I'm just guessing that there was probably some deferred revenue write-down of the asset. But you probably still had something close to the full run rate of OpEx. So I'm just trying to get a sense as to what core quarter net margins would have looked like, any thoughts on timing of synergies? Drew Del Matto : Just starting with what we're trying to accomplish with Meru, I think it's just really important to set the context. When we see -- again, wireless was becoming part of enterprise networks. And so it's another way to access the network. And so we had a wireless product. Meru had high density wireless. We're bringing the two together, effectively, to give us a broader presence in a $5 million market, quite frankly. So that was the idea there. And where we saw most of the value is really in the R&D team. We brought over the sales team, but we did our best to wean efficiencies. And we restructured, quite frankly, quite a bit of the Meru team, because obviously if you do the math, I think somebody said the margins would be $10 million to $13 million, low teen-millions dilutive. And I think we've done a good job of basically incorporating them without taking that hit. So what we did was basically failed redundancies across the merged Company. And then also found ways to eliminate real estate where possible, where we have multiple and dual location, let\u2019s say. And then just even synergies on the contract side. And we'll continue to look to do that. I mean, that's one of the benefits here. But we did not buy it as a run rate business. Clearly, Meru is not -- first of all, they weren't really performing at their run rate. You saw declining revenues. And I would characterize the business as kind of continuing in that direction, quite frankly. We didn't -- it was not growth in what they had in the past, certainly. Ken Xie : This is Ken. Also the reason we buy Meru was really wanted to secure Wi-Fi, not just the Wi-Fi they did in the past. And also that's where we only vendor to offer security combined Wi-Fi together. So, that's where most of sales team, Meru team, really had to be retrained to see how to sell a secure Wi-Fi solution, which we started a few years ago. So that's the purpose really, not continue the traditional Wi-Fi, but really secure Wi-Fi solutions. So that's the long-term target we have. Drew Del Matto : Yes, and Gray, I would even say this. I mean, what we were really trying to do, when you think about the business we acquired, was penetrate the install base with FortiGate and FortiGuard. And we even had incentives. We even changed the incentives to target the sales force to go that. I think, look, clearly we'll acknowledge that they were probably clearing out their funnels to a certain extent. But we had additional incentives in place, really encouraging the teams to work together to get their installed base on Fortinet products. That's really what we're trying to do strategically, both near and long term. And then, as Ken said the overall injecting more security into their wireless end. Ken Xie : Yes. That is really like including the Meru sales force. We add a lot of sales force in Q3. And most of them need to be trained. They need to ramp up, especially in U.S. side. And that's where we are keeping like get them ramp up quickly, but at the same time, it's also somewhat a deal may take time to get better. Drew Del Matto : Yes. I think it is very different purpose in life than what they had prior to the acquisition. Gray Powell : Got it. That's great detail. Thank you very much. Michelle Spolver : Okay, John. We can take the next question. John? Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Saket Kalla from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Saket Kalla : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. So, first just for Drew, not to revisit one of the earlier questions, but could you just maybe talk us through how to think about product revenue this quarter? I know you have a larger carve-out from some of the pricing benefit benefiting deferred. But product sales might be a little bit lighter than what some expect it. So did Meru maybe decline more than we thought, were we frankly just maybe high on the product side? Or was there something else that you would call out on product revenue in the quarter? Drew Del Matto : No, I don't think there's anything to call out. I think it's relative to the upside. Again, we are at the high end of the guidance on revenue. You are really talking about the mix. I actually think it's a normal mix, if you go back and look historically. It's not out of line with the normal. I can't really speak to what you had in your models. I pointed to a little bit of an accounting change, certainly versus a year ago. And that does account for some of it. It dilutes the upfront revenue, quite frankly, as you increase the price of the bundle on a deal-by-deal basis. I don't have anything, there's really nothing else there. I don't see anything else there that would -- certainly nothing there to bother us. I think we've pointed out, if there were any soft spots in the business, it would be more the Canada and Brazil that we talked about, emerging markets so to speak, and probably more going forward than in retrospect. And other than that, I think the billings were pretty strong. Saket Kalla : Absolutely. Got it. And then just for a follow-up, maybe for Ken. From a product perspective, Ken, I guess with the new content processor coming out soon, can you just talk about how you plan on rolling it out, maybe over the next 12 to 24 months? Is this something that you built into the higher end appliances first, and then maybe go down the stack? Or maybe just talk to us about the cadence of that new ASIC release? Ken Xie : Okay. The ASIC kind of processor the one we build a successful chip, was started new to the product. Probably would take like a few years to totally go out for the product. This apply for all the mid and high-end, and some of the low-end because low-end we using the system chip, which also integrates some of the function from the kind of processor there. So that's where it's -- like we said in the past, probably every quarter there's a couple of new products using the new chip and because they have a huge performance improvement. Like some example, like in the [SSR] acceleration, so we've improved performance by 14 times. And like the intrusion engine, they more than doubled. Like the IP stack, and that performance more than tripled. I think it is a lot of improvement, in fact a lot of new function we have. So that will help us to gain a lot of new performance in the middle range and the high end, especially to process the content side. It will take some time. We don't see much material impact, but once the product come out you can see the differentiation will widen the gap, because not our competitor will be able to deliver this kind of performance, especially in the company processing angle there. Drew Del Matto : Yes. Just one last point on the revenue, not to revisit it. But I look at billings to be -- to really reflect the overall health of the business. We've talked in the past about trying to create recurring revenue streams. The bundles actually do that very well. You may have a little bit of upfront dilution because of the change. But over time, that's the gift that keeps on giving. So effectively I have the right to bill more over time. So really I would focus more on that, the fact that from the price increase perspective, that you're really generating a higher customer lifetime value, because that's the part that you renew over time versus the upfront, which only refreshes every so often. Ken Xie : The bundle also is, as you can see, the gross margin has been the highest in the last couple of years. It's at 74% now, keeping -- that's actually similar contribution. And at the same time you can see that deferred revenue growth was over $700 million, grow like 41%. And that's also higher than the revenue, higher than the product growth. That's some contribute from the bundle increase, because the bundle also -- not only just the hardware, but also that the increase volume in the service component there. That's also helping probably more the shift in something to the server side. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi, guys. The stock is partially reflecting here in after hours the guidance on operating margins to the fourth quarter. And the sense that I get in my discussions with investors is they're worried that as we get to next quarter and the guidance for next year, that we're going to have a repeat of what happened last year, or a repeat of what we're seeing tonight where the guidance for operating margins comes below where the Street is expecting. I think we all agree that you're getting the return on investment, given the growth, the acceleration. But can you at least give us a little bit more transparency in terms of helping us understand where the right level of investment should be so that at least we are setting the right expectations in terms of the investments as it moves forward? Will we get further operating margin expansion off of the December quarter, or do you need to continue to invest at a rate where margins stay flat? Drew Del Matto : Yes. So Sterling, we, as you said, the investments are paying off. I mean, 41% growth, I think we've had record quarters several quarters ago on the billing side, so clearly paying off. We continue to see demand. And I believe that most of our competitors are saying the same thing. It's a unique opportunity to go after the incumbent space, as well as just the overall growth in security market. So it's a unique opportunity that we see, and quite frankly we're going to continue to invest. We've said that and we stand by that. We see specific opportunities in APAC. We think just a little bit of investment there in the last six months or so has made a big difference and elsewhere around the world. I mean 50% growth off some pretty good run rate in EMEA right now, I think is emblematic of the opportunity out there. And so we're going for it at. And again, the CLV happens. I think we've had a -- we've mentioned quite a bit of follow-on deals. We did 11 deals with the -- I don't know if we mentioned this, but we closed 11 deals with the U.S. Fortune 25 this quarter, some of those were expansion deals. And then the last point I would make is we are doing, we believe, extremely well at the top end of the enterprise. And one of the areas we want to invest in is more kind of in the middle and smaller part, smaller size of the enterprise. And that takes a different market awareness program, if you will, or a volatile strategy and investments, some slightly different kind of lead-to-conversion cycle. And then the sales enablement side is different. And so how we -- we are still making adjustments and we're going to continue to invest because we see opportunity. And I would just cycle back. We see the value again for every $1 initially spent on our 2009 cohort they've spent $5 over time over the next five years. And we believe that applies, and certainly we feel like we're doing extremely well at the top end and we want to translate that across the broader enterprise market. Ken Xie : One there, also the marketing also, we have the new marketing leadership there. And that's where we're keeping our best, because what we've fallen behind compared to some of our competitors, really, the mid-enterprise, which need a marketing help a lot. So that's we were keeping building both the marketing and also the mid-enterprise. It takes some time and also we have to make some adjustment in Q3, both in the field and also in the management. So we do believe we have the best product once we get all the right process, all the right -- the team in place, you can see the growth can be accelerate. Drew Del Matto : And then Sterling, just to finish, and it sounds like you might have had a follow-up or you want to push a little bit. But, we have a lot of new people in place here. And we've had a lot of success. And we now have the opportunity to really go through a robust strategic and tactical planning exercise that would -- and it would be far more beneficial to go through that with the new team than to give guidance that we didn't necessarily feel comfortable with in 2016. And so we gave guidance for 2015. We look forward to giving guidance in January on 2016. But the right thing to do here is really go look at the market, look at our opportunities, and make sure that we have the people and investments in line to drive the highest possible growth rate that leads to the highest customer long-term value for our shareholders. Sterling Auty : So you're right, just a push in this direction, so, you've seen an acceleration in billings, which will have an uplift on revenue. So I guess in order for margins to be flat or down, you would have to accelerate the pace of investment, so maybe if I asked it this way. Do you feel in order to capture the opportunity that's in front of you that you are going to have to accelerate the pace of investment relative to what you did here in 2015? Drew Del Matto : Look, I would say the right thing -- we're not -- clearly we've guided on \u201915. I would leave it we're going to continue to invest. How much we're going to invest, we really need to go through our planning cycle with our new teams. And again, we'll give you an update in January. Ken Xie : And also, like we\u2019ve mentioned the growth. This is not only at a sales capacity, but also improving the process and efficiency, so that other part, we also doing. So that's, I think, sometimes the growth can be outpaced the investment sometime if you have the better process, you can also do it other way. Sterling Auty : Got you. Thank you. Operator : So our next question comes from Melissa Gorham from Morgan Stanley. Melissa Gorham : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Drew, on the pricing increase are you seeing any customer pushback from that pricing change, or is it that you have pricing power in this case? And then how should we expect the benefit of that ASP increase to kind of ramp through the model, I guess through 2016? Drew Del Matto : Well, are we seeing pushback? Quite honestly, very little, on a one-off deal I want to -- in full disclosure, every once a while you'll hear something. But it's not -- certainly it's very much the exception. Even in the case of some of the emerging markets where I think teams were probably raising concern about it, but it never really came through, to be frank. And I wouldn't characterize it as, any different, than we've been describing over the last three or six months, quite frankly. Every once in a while you hear about it, but nobody seems to really push back at the end of the day. Our price performance is an advantage, I think, at some levels. I mean, clearly we still have a price performance advantage, even after the price increase. And I think we're pretty good at selling that, and that's the key. Where its a little rougher is where you have agreements in place, existing agreements with customers who have current pricing. And obviously that's where you're going to get the pushback, perhaps on their renewal, or even on maybe a refresh deal. That's where it's a little tougher. But on the new business, you're really bringing them in at a higher rate, so to speak, at a higher annuity stream, as I was mentioning earlier. So that's probably how to think about it. As the longer term benefit, when you think about the -- if you're talking about the accounting piece, it kind of takes a year to lag that, right, because you are doing a different compare year on year. Melissa Gorham : Okay. That makes sense. And Ken, you talked about the internal firewall opportunity. I'm just curious, is that business meaningful for you today? And then how we should expect to see that sort of ramp? And is there a different competitive dynamic in that market that you're seeing? Ken Xie : Yes. It's for the large enterprise as the all like the idea and the study implement the internal segmentation firewall. We don't see any study yet because I think for the big enterprise, again, we are studying when there are a lot of large enterprise like close to 11 of the top 25 like Fortune 25 company there. It's most of them really you've seen some internal segmentation to protect inside their network using like what they call a transparent mode or the switch mode which can protect different department, different server there. It's a net add in this whole network secured space because it is still keeping the parameters security, but it's additional protection for them. How big, how quick the market grows, we may still need a few quarter to see, but it's -- I feel it's a new architecture needed to protect a lot of big enterprise. Operator : And Your next question is from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I think you mentioned that the APT product, if I'm not mistaken, has doubled. Drew Del Matto : Tripled. Shaul Eyal : Tripled, I'm sorry. Let me take it back. Tripled. Is it the market? Is it displacement? What's driving specifically the APT? Ken Xie : I think they see a lot of a new attack, and because you see a lot of news in -- about a security breach there. And ATP is a pretty hot topic these days. But what actually helps is really how we can make an ATP working together with firewall, with other email web system because today some other like APT vendor, they can only detect some of the attack. They cannot do anything about it to prevent it happen or block. So that's the key differentiation. And we see we're needed for the customer to not only detect but also take action, and send to automatic action to prevent all these attack. It's a -- and long-term wise I do believe ATP more like a 10 years, 15 years ago our intrusion system will be part of a gateway. And just like in early days there an intruding detection system, the IDP, and then ID action -- the IP intrusion prevention. And then the next day it will be integrated into the firewall, whether Canadian firewall called UTM. So that's I feel that the ATP still in the early stage, more in the detection and they still need to working with other gateway device to do the prevention. But eventually I hope ATP can do some prevention itself. Eventually also will integrate to the gateway. So that's what I see, still in the early stage. Michelle Spolver : Yes, and I think the only thing I would like to add is that in Ken's prepared remarks he talked about several deals, highlighted a few of several deals that we won on the ATP front. And all the ones he highlighted, and they are all significant organizations, government organizations or enterprises, those included more than the Sandbox. So yes, ATP is a hot market. Vendors are being evaluated. It's definitely gone and opened up to firewall vendors with ATP solutions, but really where Fortinet's advantage is in addition to having integration between the firewall and the ATP, is the ability really to do it, to detect these types of threats and to correlate activity and communicate back and forth at the mail server through our FortiMail product, the web application firewall through FortiWeb, clients through FortiClient, as well as FortiGate and FortiSandbox. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Thank you for that, Michelle. Drew, in some of the commodity driven economies, was there a major foreign exchange impact that could have also had a direct or indirect impact on the length of the sales cycle? You did mentioned Brazil, a little bit in Canada. Maybe in Asia a little bit? Drew Del Matto : Yes. It's certainly not in Asia. And we didn't really see it in Latin America either, quite honestly. In terms of pricing, look, we didn't really -- I can't correlate any of -- any pricing issues with any of the economies, quite honestly. I think I heard noise, but I didn't see anything come in. It was more like, be prepared if I need to drop a little bit on price, that I may need your support. But I never really see it -- I never saw anything hit my screen, so to speak, that would've indicated that that happened. And there is no indication that we have when we go back and look at the numbers that would show that. If anything, the gross margins look good. So you have to kind of believe that the pricing held. What we really saw on those economies, you just started to get the sense that it's going to get a little more challenging in some of those emerging markets. And then in Canada I think it's already challenging. I think we saw that and clearly saw that in Q3. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to actually follow-up on the last one. So with the upside in the gross margin this quarter, do you think you could use it possibly more aggressively to drive higher billings growth? Drew Del Matto : Could we use price -- you're basically asking me if we use price to drive higher billings growth. Look, I don't think we need to. We feel we're still very compelling on the price-performance front. If we're going to -- if people are going to go based on price performance, we're probably going to get the deal. So I don't see any reason to go do that. If I were seeing deals that we were turning down based on that then that may be a consideration. I think it's more about the selling cycle itself that really hits the impact of the deals. I haven't seen lose on price, to be frank. So I wouldn't want to do that. If anything, I think we're personally headed, I would like to see us headed in the other direction sometimes, so. Andrew Nowinski : And then regarding some of the investments you've made in sales and marketing, can you just give us any sort of color on what percentage of your sales reps are currently at full productivity and where you are with that investment? Drew Del Matto : Yes. The tenured reps are really doing well versus productivity. I would say kind at or above, I think in general, a nice, probably a pretty solid distribution on the tenured. The newer ones coming in, where we've been focusing has been on the lower end of the enterprise. If you look at the mid-level and the lower level, if you look at where we've build capacity, it's been more on the high end of the business. And as I said, we closed -- I mentioned two deals with -- on the call, and I think I just mentioned that we've closed 11 deals with U.S. Fortune 25 customers. So we seem to be knocking off the big names and the big brands extremely well. We\u2019ve seen that coming, so we started investing more middle and lower. And clearly, we have new marketing leadership. And what we believe -- where we believe the focus needs to be now is really on getting the newer people up to productivity actually quicker than they had been in the past. And it's more of an opportunity. Let's say it's an opportunity, not an issue. And I'm just going to kind of turn this into kind of where we're investing, because that's one of the areas we're investing and we called out on the call on the script, for instance, market awareness, the lead generation cycle, lead to closure, and then sales enablement. It's just a different motion and from the top to the bottom of the market, top to middle to bottom. Andrew Nowinski : Got it. Thanks. Drew Del Matto : You're welcome. Michelle Spolver : John, we can take the next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Please go ahead, Michael. Michael Turits : Drew, thanks for letting us know that the Meru revenues did go down. That's helpful. Last time that they reported it was about $17 million in Q1. But unless they went down to $9 million or less, you'd have to calculate that your organic revenue actually decelerated from the 30% growth rate to less than 30% in 3Q. So, what should I conclude that your organic revenue growth actually did decelerate from 30%, or that the Meru revenues really came down, like to less than $9 million? And if so, how can that be? How could they possibly come down that much? Drew Del Matto : I'm not sure I'm following your math. It certainly wasn't $17 million. Ken Xie : Mike probably $10 million really, the reason on Meru was really it has offered a secure Wi-Fi solution. We\u2019d do that, it's a huge market opportunity in Wi-Fi space. So that's -- so we had to retrain a lot of sales, pretty much of sales there in Meru to how to do the secure Wi-Fi solutions, or that's the purpose we're doing. Also, you see the early question we have the most service piece right now. So that's where you see the deferred revenue growth is higher than some other part. So I'm not sure the revenue or the billing -- maybe billing is a better way to measure it. Drew Del Matto : Yes. But anyway, Michael, it wasn't a significant piece of our business, quite frankly. We got them at least a week plus into the quarter and there was a ton of sales enablement going on there, sales training and even looking, trying to refocus them to sell more FortiGate and FortiGuards. So, I don't think reading too much into that would really be the right way to think about it. Michael Turits : Right, so I'm trying to give it the (multiple speakers) Drew Del Matto : That's not where we're going at. Michael Turits : Yes, I know. And understand the reason for it. I'm just trying to get the best possible read in terms of the numbers which have been so strong. So assuming am I fair in concluding that really you're just talking about a couple million that it was contributing? Because otherwise it really seems like the numbers were not all that great? Drew Del Matto : I really can't give a number. So we haven't done it. We said we were -- we didn't give a number to start with, we didn't give a number now, and we're not -- we're looking at as -- we have a secure wireless business. That's really the way we're doing it. We run it inside-out. I think trying to get targeted, I'm just concerned about getting targeted on a number like that, it sounds like we're running it like Meru ran it, which like you said, we took a lot of cost out of there so it's a much -- it's not at all the business that they were running as a separate company. Michelle Spolver : The other thing I'd add too, though Michael, is that when we give our guidance for Q3 we said we didn't break it up. We made a very clear point that we weren't breaking it up. We said it wasn't going to be what -- it was less than what the Street was sort of forecasting. We worked it into, and we consider that. We considered that the contribution into our guidance and we overachieved our guidance. And the far overachievement -- and the overachievement on billings did not [multiple speakers] Ken Xie : We also promised we\u2019ll maintain the operating margin, 14% for the year, even with the acquisition. So that's also lot of reporting there, try to make sure we keep the cost down. Drew Del Matto : We were focused on integrating as quickly as possible. And Michael, I don't know if this helps, but one way to think about it is that their gross margins, I believe, were in the low 60%, kind of 61% range. Clearly we were well above that. And if there were any positive skew on the revenue side, you would certainly pick it up in the gross margin. Michael Turits : So I think of that as the way of going forward? In other words, if it's really just an insignificant amount of millions of dollars this quarter, is that going to change anytime in the future? Is that the way I should think of for a couple of\u2026 Drew Del Matto : Well, look, I mean we're going to -- it's going to be -- we're not keeping the brand. It's a Fortinet product, its Fortinet wireless product and pretty soon it will be a Fortinet and increased security Fortinet wireless product. That's the way we're going to run it. The Meru piece of it really goes away over time as what we bought. Operator : So our next question is from Erik Suppiger from JMP. Erik, your line is open. Erik Suppiger : Yes. Thanks. Can you give us a little sense for how we should think of the Americas revenues geographically? What kind of exposure can we think of in the U.S. versus outside of the U.S.? Michelle Spolver : In Q4? Erik Suppiger : Just in general, or at least in Q3. And the reason I'm bringing it up is you had noted emerging markets in Canada as being a headwind. I'd like to get a sense for what kind of exposure you have to those headwinds. Michelle Spolver : I think what you're talking -- it does help to actually if you're talking about Q3 or Q4. I think what he's asking from a revenue perspective what -- one, we don't break it out, but what contribution comes from outside. In the markets we identified, and in Q3 a headwind came from Canada. In Q4, when we\u2019re talking in terms of uncertainty, it still remains to be Canada, and Canada's in a recession, its public. And Brazil is just uncertain in terms of what happens in their economy. I would say we don't break out revenue for billings for a country. But together Latin America and Canada is a material portion of America's revenue. Drew Del Matto : Yes. If the question was more just around the economic advisement in the U.S., we think it remains solid, certainly from security perspective. Erik Suppiger : Is the majority of revenue in the Americas coming from the U.S.? Drew Del Matto : Certainly the majority is, Yes. Erik Suppiger : Okay. Then you had a -- I know you guys have shifts quarter-to-quarter in terms of the product breakout, but there was a meaningful decline in the high-end product versus -- the volumes of high-end products versus the prior quarter. And you're talking about doing more segmentation firewalls. So can you give us a little sense for what it was that was causing the decline in the high-end products? Drew Del Matto : Well, I think it's just more skew towards the lower end. There was at least one deal -- we talked about a FortiBranch -- there was one deal in particular, and it's a large enough deal that it probably contributed to the skew on that side, where they bought the branch first. And so the branches are a lower-end product. Look, I mean\u2026 Michelle Spolver : And they brought it in conjunction -- it's a branch to core. They bought high-end products, they bought midrange products, and they bought a lot of low-range products. Drew Del Matto : Just keep in mind, what's really a large opportunity over time. We just got the initial taste in it in Q3. I think the product mix piece, if you look at the trend over time I think the high-end is in the relative range -- relevant range that it's been in over the last couple of years. I think last quarter was particularly good from the high end. And then this quarter was probably -- was certainly down from that but within range on the longer term trend. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Jonathan, please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Guys, just switching gears a little bit to some of the partnerships that you referenced in the early part of the conference call. I just wanted to understand a little bit better about your opportunity set with both VMware and Cisco. And maybe how you think about that sort of driving growth in 2016, what the revenue recognition model looks like for more virtual appliances, and just that general sort of partnership contribution over time? Ken Xie : They are definitely the partner which already have quite some installation in whether data center in the network side. So that's where the partnership really help us not only get into some new deal but also enhance some of the solution we have with them. I guess also said as would empower ahead of our competitor because like I said, it's a secure to need to be part of infrastructure. So this partnership actually help us like make our solution fit better in the total solution there. It's difficult to quantify any of this partnership may bring it, but definitely from the position side is a well positioned, much better than like a couple quarters ago. Also the Sprung is other company we partner well, so we have a joint event a few weeks ago, and it's a long customer like the partnership a lot. Drew Del Matto : I guess one of these things that we\u2019re on questions that you have to answer for customers on the large deals, will you be -- how will you play in a more virtualized infrastructure, if that occurs. I don't think people or customers really aren't -- we haven't seen much activity buying against that necessarily yet. And then, Jonathan, you asked about the revenue recognition piece of it, and it depends. There's a variety of ways to go there. I mean they could literally buy, still buy a FortiGate and stick that closer to the data center. Again, we have a performance of management, it's a chip that\u2019s just one architecture another architecture is to buy a virtual license, basically buy the software, a virtual firewall, which we sell. And then another way to get there is actually do it from a service provider. So go to AWS or buy a license and do it on AWS. Quite honestly, it's probably going to be -- if it's an appliance, it's kind of our traditional model right now where some of it is upfront, some of it is deferred and recognized over time. If it's a software license, that actually pretty much goes upfront, but they're probably buying subscription with that too. So that part gets over time. And then if it's a service, there's really no upfront. That's just happening -- that's a pay-as-you-go model where they pay on a utility base, how much do I use, and you basically bill them monthly or whatever the utility basis is for that deal. So it could be anything. If I had -- I don't have anything major to highlight there in the near term that would impact I think the recognition of the site, certainly in the near term. And it's something probably more important to watch on the longer term. Jonathan Ho : And then just as a follow-up, you guys talked about the 11 out of the top 25 on sort of Fortune 25 companies that you were able to sell to. Are you starting to see a tipping point in the market where folks are now really recognizing the Fortinet brand, and what does this do to sort of accelerate momentum in the enterprise space? Drew Del Matto : Jonathan, you broke up a bit there at the beginning of the call. Can you repeat the question please? Jonathan Ho : The question is that now that you've gotten sort of traction with the top 11 or you talk about 11 out of the top 25 customers signing onboard in terms of the Fortune 25. How does that sort of translate in terms of getting more brand recognition, more traction? Does this start to accelerate your growth now that you've signed more marquee customers in this enterprise range? Drew Del Matto : Well, I think one, they have big wallets. So that's the first thing to state. Obviously those are going to be where the biggest wallets are. So rich opportunities, both near and long term is the way we think about that. Then just not only for expansion with more FortiGates or more FortiGuard, or what's currently on our price book, but just as we add additional products, that's another way to upsell them, so to speak, over time and further monetize them. So that's the first dimension of that. Then I think the second piece is those companies tend very much reflect very tech savvy customers, cutting-edge. What they are buying and architecting is probably what gets reflected in the broader enterprise over time. And so then we capture the thought leadership, so to speak, is the idea. And then hopefully that translates more into the middle market and across the enterprise over time. That's how we think about it. So, step one was to get the big names. And we feel like we're doing a good job of doing that, as evidenced by some of the numbers we said. I think we also threw out some large deal statistics, which were 59% growth in deals over $100,000, 55% in deals over $1 million. We've said this many times, that's one of the things we look at to see, are we really getting traction with our investments in the enterprise specifically, because SMBs aren't buying the $1 million deals. Jonathan Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Zeller from Needham. Scott your line is open. Scott Zeller : Hi. Good afternoon. I may have missed it earlier, but I'm used to hearing about the U.S. enterprise growth last couple of quarters. Could you update us on that, please? Drew Del Matto : Sure. As I said very robust market in the U.S. enterprise, our deals greater than $100,000 were 59%. Our deals ever $1 million were 55%. I think I also mentioned that we had deals in 11 of the U.S. Fortune 500. And so that went very well. Year to date, our growth in the U.S. enterprise alone is north of 60% -- I think it's 61%. So those are the numbers we have. Scott Zeller : Well, I think we got a number last quarter of 90% year-on-year growth. So can you give us the quarterly number? Drew Del Matto : Yes. It was I think, yes, 27%. Scott Zeller : So it was up 27% year-on-year? Michelle Spolver : Yes. Drew Del Matto : Yes, 27%. Michelle Spolver : You have to look at it, though. I mean, I think that for us, we're looking at continued growth. We're really looking at the type of deals that we are winning, the logos that we're winning. So I think every quarter's a little bit different in terms of growth as we get bigger. So the numbers will get smaller in terms of growth. But what's really important to us is making sure we're getting the right deals that will fuel our growth for the future. And we talk about, again, securing deals in 11 of the top 25. The deals we won this quarter we're really proud of. We've talked about who they are, one of the largest investment banks in the world, two of the largest technology brands in the world. So those are not the type of deals that we were getting before we made the investment in the U.S. enterprise, So we're pleased with that. Drew Del Matto : Yes, when you look at just the growth and the enterprise traction, I think -- that's why I pointed out the deals, the number of large deals. Again, that's what we very much look to, to look at the traction. And again, our tenured reps seem to be very -- doing very well. So we feel pretty good about that that business. Scott Zeller : I guess I'm just confused because in the June quarter it was up 90% year-on-year and in the March quarter it was up 70% year-on-year. And you're saying now it's up only 27% year-on-year? I mean, I think that needs a clear explanation. Michelle Spolver : Then we just explained? Scott Zeller : It doesn't make sense. Michelle Spolver : I don't know that we can explain any more than we just explained. I mean, I think that obviously the growth is lower from a year-on-year perspective. I'd have to go back and look at and see what it was in Q3 and how difficult the comp was. But it's going to change quarter-to-quarter. And I think for us what's really important is getting the right companies and we've really been focusing a lot on the high end. Drew mentioned, I think, before in terms of, and Ken, doing a little bit -- needing to do a little bit more where investments will be going as well on the mid-market, which are clearly enterprise. Drew Del Matto : Yes, Scott. I mean, we're doing well at the top end. That's the way to think about it. We pointed out the investments where we think we need to make them, which were more in the middle and the low end. We've onboarded people, and we talk about it's just a different -- we think it's just a very different selling motion. What we look at the beginning, like I said was the large deals. That's why I started off like that. That's good, clearly very good. The names we're taking down are very good as well. Where we feel we have an opportunity to make adjustments, really, is in that middle and lower end space where we have, one, new marketing leadership. And then also I think we're very much looking at the way we go to market in the mid and the smaller enterprise. And Scott, this isn't new. We've been talking about that, that we've been doing well at the high end and where we're going to invest is more in the middle and below. And that's where we are. And that's, I think, pretty much how we did it. I mean, there's always, as you get into larger deals, just always timing, if you wanted to go there of when a deal happens or not. But again, we had 41% growth and we're happy with the growth. The investments are paying off. And I think that's the explanation that we have. Ken Xie : Also, some of the big enterprise deal can be chunky. And for us sometime winning some new customer initially, maybe a small could be more important because they have a long-term value there. So that's where like you see some quarter there are maybe a few bigger deal, they may help the growth. But sometime -- but we also want to measured how many new customers we also signed on. So that's why we're happy with the result in last quarter. Scott Zeller : I don't know. I mean, can you help explain -- one would think that there's a correlation between the high-end SKUs and U.S. data center or U.S. enterprise sales. So why -- we saw a change in the mix for high-end SKUs and we saw a sharp downturn in U.S. enterprise. Are those not connected or correlated? Ken Xie : Some customer can be by, so like some big enterprise customer, they can buy like tens of hundred high-end box in one deal. That's why I mentioned some deals can be chunky. That may shift a certain percentage associating a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. So we're not worried about some of that. It's only like -- we're more looking at long-term value, and that is some new deal and I mean, new customer. Some is more important and because like once we land it, we see the long-term value. And like Drew said, the initial $1 purchase, a few years they can expand more than $5. So that's more important for us. Drew Del Matto : Scott, you have to understand there are lot of these customers are -- we talk about an initial seat at very large tables. And sometimes the deals actually are relatively small in the enterprise. And I think that was a bit of what we saw this quarter. It's -- look, that's why I think the year-to-date number is important, the fact that we had pretty good larger deal transactions. We feel like we continue to take down the names and we'll land and expand in those. And then I think we're fully -- I think where we really look to expand going forward is kind of more in the mid and the smaller end of the enterprise. Ken Xie : Yes. Scott maybe the other way to measure, you look at the number of deal over like whether $1 million or $0.5 million $0.25 million. So that growth rate has not slowed down, and that has maintained almost the same compared to the last few quarter. But it's some of enterprise, like I said, the big enterprise, they can have some bigger deal which is chunky, may affect quarter up and down little bit and the last word and also some developed by the many like do some big enterprise, they may like do some branch office deployment, which may also change in the percentage of our high-end to low-end product. and that's what happened in the last -- could be happening in the last few quarters. Drew Del Matto : Yes. And also I think internationally. I know you're asking about the U.S., but the 50% growth in EMEA is a very enterprise-centric statistic. So, it's not like everything is going to be great, extremely great every quarter. And I think the EMEA 50% growth was something to point to, to look at continued fraction of the product. And then I think we certainly acknowledge the opportunity to penetrate further in the enterprise in the middle and lower end of the U.S. enterprise. Ken Xie : Yes the other point, really, we are much more diversified compared to some other company to focus in certain sector, so both on the geographic, you can see the international and like a both in the APAC and also American here, we were quite well diversified. The same thing in different sectors, whether the carrier, the enterprise, the SMBs, so we are much more diversified that's where making -- so we have a healthy building growth even some enterprise mix change in some of the deal may be like a shifting from quarter to quarter. But we're not that impact compared with some other companies. Scott Zeller : Thanks for the color. Michelle Spolver : Okay, John. Actually before -- actually, if I can interrupt I know we have a few people in the queue here. We need to start a 3 :30 call and we need to get off this call to start the next one. So I think let's just have the next question be the last question. And then I apologize there's three of you in the queue. If you are planning on calling back at 3 :30, I will make sure you get the first -- the priority in the queue. So with that, I think let's take the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Walter Prichard from Citi. Jim Fish : Hey, guys. This is actually Jim on for Walter. I'll make this one quick and then I'll join the other call. I guess my question is around how much of that deferred revenue written down was short-term versus long-term for Meru? Just trying to gauge the short-term billing. Drew Del Matto : Do you mind repeating the question? I'm getting advice, but I'm not sure I'm answering the same question. Jim Fish : Just around how much -- Drew Del Matto : How much are you asking, what was the split, kind of the percentage split, long -- short and long term on Meru? Jim Fish : On the\u2026. Drew Del Matto : On the write-down or the deferred revenue? Jim Fish : Yes, on that $10 million deferred. Drew Del Matto : You know what, I'm going to double-check the number and I'll get back to you. They're telling me 50%, but I want to double-check the number. Jim Fish : Okay. I'll talk to you guys in a bit. Drew Del Matto : We'll get back to you, I'll tell you what we'll get back to you in five minutes. Jim Fish : Okay, great. Thanks. Drew Del Matto : I just want to make sure I have the right -- answering the right question. A - Michelle Spolver : I think with that, we're going to -- we'll end this call. And I apologize again that we had to sort of start over. We went long here. For those of you calling back in at 3 :30, we will talk to, I guess, in about 12 minutes. So enjoy the short break. And thanks again for your patience through this process. Operator : Okay, ladies and gentlemen. This conference has concluded. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

With that, let me now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Okay. Thanks, Michelle and thanks for everyone on the call today to discuss our fourth-quarter and FY '15 result. I'm pleased to share that we have a solid fourth quarter, driven by 35% year-over-year growth in billings. We continue to gain market share, growing more than 3 times of the network secured market one billion dollar scale. We're succeeding in landing important new customers, expanding within our leasing base of more than 250,000 customers and innovating and delivering the best products in the industry. The internal segmentation trend that we first identified in 2014 is playing our nicely around the world. Fortinet's strong advantage on both performance and feature is driving the growth in our business. This is evidenced by the strong sales of high-end FortiGate system during the first quarter which accounted for 42% of our total FortiGate billings. We continue to see healthy enterprise demand globally for high-end Fortigate appliances deployed as internal segmentation firewall to help protect the key network resource from attacks that get past premature defense or originally from within. The very high performance that is required for the internal firewall deployment is something Fortinet offers better than anyone else. And the ability to deploy our solutions in a transparent or switch mode to enhance, not disrupt existing network architecture has enabled an expansion opportunity within our installation base and has also opened doors for new customers. Since Fortinet's start, our exceptional technology has been a differentiator that has helped fuel our success. No other vendor can deliver the broad, integrated security functionality and exceptional performance we have achieved with our FortiASIC, hold as many product certifications or offer such a comprehensive portfolio of security products. As seen on slide 3, Fortinet's platform delivers intelligent security inside a network at an age and end point to enable similar security across our entire tech service from client to the core network to the cloud. Most other vendors only have pieces of the platform which leave open holes and makes security too complex to manage. Expanding beyond our core FortiGate deployment and selling our complementary products is one of our largest growth opportunities to address the more than $20 billion total addressable market. We're winning with a platform approach and during the fourth quarter closed several large deals around the world that included a mix of four or more Fortinet products including FortiGate, FortiSandbox, FortiMail, FortiWeb, FortiClient, FortiAP and others. This platform approach is so helping us address advanced threats better than any other vendor. As a result, we saw another quarter of very strong growth in sales of our FortiSandbox client and cloud service. Beyond just the ATP solution, Fortinet has a significant advantage in our ability to offer a comprehensive ATP framework that integrates FortiSandbox with our FortiGate next generation of firewall; FortiMail, email security; FortiWeb, application firewall; and FortiClient, end point product with our world-class research team to detect, correlate and stop zerodase threat and parameter e-mail, Web and end point. This provide customers with reduced complexity and a true integration between multiple protection systems. On the ATP front, we're not just expanding within existing accounts, we're also landing new deals lead by FortiSandbox and other advanced technology products. In Q4, some of this included a [indiscernible] end point APT competitive win with a large regional community health organization in the U.S. who chose FortiSandbox and FortiClient solutions. We also landed a deal with a service firm in Europe and an employment service company in the U.S. that chose FortiSandbox with FortiMail product for advanced protection of the network and e-mail traffic. Though it is still early in the adoption cycle, we also continue to see the traction of our product in the virtue and COG-based environment. As seen on slide 4, Fortinet has technology and product partnership with all major cloud platform providers. During the fourth quarter, a few of the cloud deal including two U.S. enterprise software companies select the Fortinet virtual firewall to run on the new cloud platform. And that deal with European government agency to secure their copy righted space infrastructure. Looking ahead, I am especially excited about a new product. We begin a new product cycle with the release of our FortiASIC process line that will further differentiate us from competitors and meet customers increasing requirements. In CP9, computationally intensive intrusion prevention, asset inspection and virtual private networking are uploaded to the ASIC to speed up processing and help eliminate network performance bottleneck. With CP9, Fortinet will once again raise the bar to deliver the industry's finest security performance. Over the next few years, we're refreshing our entire line of mid-range, enterprise and acaricross [ph] Fortigate system to continuously extend our product and technology lead. Also early today, we announced our 40 OS 5.4 operation system which bring many exciting new features to our FortiGate appliance. Advanced management computation, improved analytics and our swift one-click action in 40 OS 5.4 make it easier to implement an operationalize the internal segmentation firewall, advanced to add protection and secure excess control. 40 OS 5.4 also brings advanced security for protecting mobile device and applications. With a broad integrated feature, highest performance and a strong position in the carrier network, Fortinet has a strong competitive advantage here in our ability to provide content application and user security in the mobile environment. A few weeks ago, we held our annual global partner conference and I'm pleased to share that enthusiasm for Fortinet is highest ever as we shared with partners Fortinet's product plan and sales strategy. We're now a $1 billion-plus company selling to and supporting the largest corporation and government entity in the world. To better align with our scope and scale, we have unified our sales force under one global structure led by Patrice Perche, Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Support. Patrice has been with Fortinet for almost 12 years and has done a truly exceptional job of leading and growing our business in EMEA and APAC where we're the number one network security company in many countries. He brings his best practice in sales and operation to our entire global sales force going forward. Fortinet has a clear technology advantage and a strong innovative road map in place to help us continue to grow our market position and address a huge market opportunity. From the start, our vision was to deliver broad, truly integrated high-performance security across the IT infrastructure. We're seeing it play out in the market now and we're well positioned to continue to succeed. I will now turn the call to Drew to review our financial results for Q4 and FY '15, as well as outlook for the first quarter of 2016. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. Fortinet ended our 2015 fiscal year strong with billings, revenue and EPS meeting or exceeding our guidance. We're particularly pleased with our billings growth of 35% which is above our guided range. As Ken mentioned, we continue to grow roughly 3 times faster than the network security market and Fortinet is one of very few companies with over a $1 billion run rate that is achieving this level of impressive growth. It's noteworthy that we're also maintaining profitability, adding new customers and generating significant free cash flow. During Q4, we continued to execute on our strategy of acquiring first seats at tables and landing several marquis deals at some of the largest, most well-known enterprises in the world. These customers, as well as those we've added in recent quarters have vast infrastructures and provide abundant expansion opportunities for Fortinet in the future. We continue to see our land and expand opportunity play out during the quarter, highlighted by several large expansion deals from enterprise customers acquired as recently as two quarters ago. I've spoken about the lifetime value of our customers and shared that a new customer that spent $1 with us in the first year ultimately spent over $5 with us over a five-year period based on our 2009 cohort through 2014 I'm happy to report CLV has risen to more than 6.5 for the same cohort for 2015. We have far more enterprise customers today than we had in 2009, providing a fertile opportunity to grow our CLV with expansion deals. Not only does this expansion give us confidence in future growth for years to come. It will also be a driver of leverage in our operating model over time, as it costs less to expand within a customer than it does to land one. We're very pleased with this achievement. Now let me share our financial results for the fourth quarter which can be seen on slide 5. As I just mentioned, Fortinet's billings increased 35% year over year to $381 million, exceeding our guided range of $364 million to $369 million. Total revenue of $297 million was up 32% year over year and above the midpoint of our guided range of $293 million to $298 million. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $791 million, up 42% year over year, exceeding our billings growth of 35% and illustrating our ability to sell more subscriptions and services. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margin was 16% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.18, consistent with our guidance. In accordance with our communicated plan, we continued to invest in line with our strategy to drive growth. Higher gross margin of 74% was driven by higher-value subscription bundles which drove growth in this valuable, margin-rich recurring revenue stream. Finally, our cash generation is substantial and growing as evidenced by the $60 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter, up 101% from last year. This continues to demonstrate Fortinet's ability to generate a significant amount of cash while investing for future growth. Our fourth-quarter guidance included the contribution from our Meru Networks acquisition. Sales from the former Meru contributed $16.5 million in billings and $16 million in revenue during Q4. Our new secure enterprise Wi-Fi product line which incorporates our best of breed security with Wi-Fi technology we acquired from Meru, is slated to be announced in the first half of this year. With the integration nearly completed, including a fully combined sales team, integrated price book and sales funnel, along with systems and operational processes, we will not break out Meru sales going beyond Q4 2015. Our quarterly performance continued to reflect a healthy security market as the number and sophistication of network security threats continued to grow. This is illustrated by various high-profile attacks that have occurred recently, some of which made headlines and many that did not. The cost of cybercrime is estimated to be up to $1 trillion or approximately 1% of global GDP. Cyber security related job postings have recently grown 3 times faster than overall IT job postings which is a positive future indicator for growth and change. Cybercrimes will continue to increase in sophistication and cost. We expect this trend to bring a greater focus on corporate responsibility and increasing accountability to protect information. As a result, security remains a critical IT investment priority. As Ken stated, companies are demanding a proven best in class integrated cyber security platform like Fortinet's rather than disparate point solutions that are costly and less secure. In Q4, we added approximately 9,000 new customers to our base of more than 250,000 customers. A few deals landed with new customers included a first seat at the table of a Fortune top 5 company that is one of the largest brands in the world. This was an expansive firewall refresh project and the customer wanted a more feature-rich, integrated security solution that would allow them to consolidate multiple disparate point products onto a single platform. They chose Fortinet over the incumbent competitor for the strength and breadth of our integrated cyber security platform and ability to scale to support future growth. We also landed a deal with a major household global consumer brand clothing company that chose Fortinet for a large branch to core deployment based on our unique ability to provide an integrated security and wireless access platform that included our FortiGate, FortiSwitch and FortiAP products. We continue to acquire first seats at very large tables and are also winning substantial expansion deals due to the strength and performance of our integrated cyber security platform. In Q4, we expanded in numerous large enterprise accounts. Some of these were landed as recently as just two quarters ago, demonstrating that our investment strategy is paying off. A few of the many expansion deals closed during Q4 included a data center firewall deal with one of the largest banks in the world. We landed a first seat at this table in Q2 for a large internal segmentation firewall deal. In Q4, we landed another important seat via a new deal and strengthened our strategic position in this account. We also expanded within one of the most recognized European auto makers in the world that upgraded and expanded its Fortinet deployment with the purchase of numerous additional next-generation firewalls and services. Our service provider business around the world was also very strong during the quarter. This was in large part driven by technology upgrades for cloud-based security offerings and new MSFP offerings. Fortinet is the partner of choice for nearly every major service provider in the world. This is due to the fact that we provide the highest levels of performance, security and advanced networking as well as superior deployment flexibility. This combination allows them to offer an array of services including fully hosted managed security, private hosted cloud or customer premise based services. Some large wins during this quarter included seven-figure expansion deals with several U.S. and international service providers that upgraded and expanding their large Fortinet deployments to deliver new cloud-based managed security services to support growing subscriber bases. As Ken mentioned, we continued to see a high level of interest in our internal network segmentation firewalls which are highly differentiated from competitors in terms of security, performance and ease of deployment. Sales of our FortiSandbox ATP appliances also continued to grow in all three geographies, with total billings more than quadrupling year over year. The integration of FortiSandbox with our firewalls, e-mail appliances and web security appliances delivered an advanced threat prevention framework that no other security vendor could offer. We also continued to see nice growth in sales of our secure Wi-Fi appliances as well as our FortiClient end point software products. Finally, I'd like to highlight that we had numerous large subscription and support renewal deals with existing Fortinet customers. Our renewal rates which are tracked by appliances, not customers, remain in the mid-70% range and exclude product refresh and upgrade purchases. Our customer retention rate continues to be above 90% which demonstrates overall customer satisfaction as well as the stickiness of our solutions. Our high renewal and retention rates also show that we're not only winning numerous customers from incumbents, but we're keeping them. During Q4, the number of large deals grew in all categories. Deals over $100,000 grew 50%, deals over $250,000 grew 41% and deals over $1 million also grew in both number and size of deals. Our breakdown of billings across our top five verticals was service provider at 26%, government at 13%, financial services at 10%, education at 7% and retail at 7%. Now let me turn to the geographic breakdown of billings for Q4 which had strong year-on-year, year-over-year growth across all regions. Americas billings grew 33%, EMEA billings grew 40% and APAC billings grew 30%. The Americas had another solid quarter, especially given the continued economic headwind from Canada. Also recent investments in sales and marketing are still ramping. We're still focusing on market awareness, lead generation and sales enablement in the Americas, led by our CMO who started in September 2015. Fortinet is truly a global portfolio business, diverse in both geographic and market scope. We've grown well across all regions and segments, including the service provider, SMP, SMB and enterprise markets. Seeing an opportunity in the U.S. enterprise market where we were underpenetrated, we began investing and targeting this market about two years ago. In that time, this business grew 77%. We've also landed some of the largest and most important logos in the world. We focused on and talked about our U.S. enterprise business as the higher-end segment of the enterprise versus the less discussed but much broader mid-market enterprise. We've succeeded in acquiring many large enterprises, but there have been some challenges including long sales cycles which we again faced in the fourth quarter. As a result, our high-end U.S. enterprise team grew billings 15% year over year as we continued to be affected by the size and timing of specific deals with customers in the top end of the enterprise market. We believe growing in the broader mid-market enterprise would help provide more consistent enterprise growth in addition to expanding our market opportunity. Turning to international performance, EMEA delivered another exceptional quarter, growing an impressive 40% year over year. We delivered strong results across all sub regions, especially the UK and Middle East. Return on investments and upgrading our sales force and reseller channel continued to yield growth and expansion. In APAC, we grew 30% year over year and saw strong performance in Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia. We're also seeing returns in APAC in our sales and marketing investments. Before moving on to the breakdown of our products, I want to elaborate on the positive changes we're making to enhance our sales structure. We're excited about the evolution of our global sales model under Patrice Perche's leadership, as Ken noted earlier. Our teams are already up and running. Our newly globally structured sales force enables us to better source, win and support multi-national enterprises more effectively. As our sales force integrates to attack the large multi-nationals, the former U.S. enterprise team has been redistributed to focus on either large global strategic accounts or regional territories. The U.S. enterprise metric we have been providing was based on sales team alignment. That specific team no longer exists with our global strategic account and regional models. As such, the U.S. enterprise metric will no longer be applicable. We will utilize data on product billings mix, large deals and key wins as metrics to gauge the success of our global enterprise investment strategy. Our geographical and top side vertical reporting is also useful in understanding our various market trends. Now turning to billings by product segment on slide 6, we continued to see diversity of product billings across all segments. Our high-end FortiGate products accounted for 42% of total product billings, up both sequentially and year over year. This indicates strong sales to service providers and large enterprises. Our mid-range enterprise products accounted for 26% of the total mix and our entry level products accounted for 32%. Total revenue was $297 million during the fourth quarter, up 32% year over year and at the high end of our guided range. Revenue performance was driven by the combination of 31% year-over-year product revenue growth and 34% year-over-year services revenue growth. On a geographic basis, you can see on slides 7 and 8 that revenue continued to be diversified globally which remains a key strength of our business. In the Americas, revenues grew 33% to $122 million. EMEA revenues grew 35% to $115 million and APAC revenues grew 26% to $59 million. Moving to non-GAAP expenses and profitability, during the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP gross profit margin was 74%, above our guided range of 70% to 72%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 63% Non-GAAP service gross margin was 84%, highlighting the margin expansion opportunity of our FortiGuard and FortiCare subscription offerings which are also recurring revenue streams. Non-GAAP gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as our VM line of virtualized security solutions and the impact of recent price increases to our FortiGuard security subscription bundles. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $171 million during the fourth quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $48 million or 16% of total revenue. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $32 million or $0.18 per share based on 177 million diluted shares outstanding. The non-GAAP tax rate for 2015 was 34%. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP financials can be seen on slides 12 through 15. As seen on slide 8, we ended Q4 with a strong balance sheet including $1.164 billion in cash and investments. Our $60 million of free cash flow was primarily offset by $60 million of share repurchases. As previously mentioned, free cash flow increased in the fourth quarter by 101% year over year. This includes a $9 million benefit received in a favorable litigation settlement in December. Our continued strong cash flow reflects our ability to invest in the company to support growth while also generating substantial free cash flow. Annualized inventory turns for Q4 were 2.3, in line with our annualized goal of 2 or better. Our deferred revenue balance increased $791 million, up $233 million or 42% year over year and $84 million sequentially. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.76 million common shares for approximately $60 million at an average price of $34.12. As of the end of December, we've repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares for a total of approximately $137.5 million at an average price of $24.84 under the $200 million stock repurchase program that began in December of 2013. This plan expired on December 31, 2015. However, earlier today we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new $200 million share repurchase plan that will extend through December 31, 2017. Before discussing forward guidance, let me wrap up by quickly running through some summary level financial results for the full year 2015 as shown on slide 10. Billings for 2015 were $1.232 billion, up 37% year over year and more than triple the growth rate of the network security market. Revenue for 2015 was $1.009 million, up 31% year over year. Deferred revenue grew $232 million, up 42% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 73% and contributed to non-GAAP operating income of $133 million or 13.2% of revenue. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.51 for the year based on 176 million shares. And free cash flow increased 49% year over year to $245 million or 24% of revenue, up from 21% in 2014. Now, let me finish with our guidance for both the first quarter and full year 2016. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements including all of the guidance statements provided are subject to Michelle's cautions at the start of this call. Fortinet's market opportunity and technology advantage is significant and our investments have helped lay the foundation for our future growth and increasing profitability as we continue to scale Fortinet to be a multi-billion-dollar business. We've more than doubled our annual growth rate over the past two years and continued to take market share and grow more than 3 times the industry growth rate. Market signals and discussions with customers point to a continued healthy security market, but continued uncertainty in the global economy could potentially impact our business. Additionally, our recent sales organization changes that we believe will greatly benefit us in the long term may cause minor disruption in the short term. For these reasons, we're approaching Q1 and 2016 with cautious optimism. During Q1, we expect billings to be in the range of $315 million to $322 million, up approximately 25% year over year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $270 million to $275 million, up 28% year over year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 72% to 73%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 8% to 9%, reflecting typical seasonality in our Q1 operating expenses which include higher benefit and payroll costs. And, finally we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.08 to $0.09 based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 179 million to 181 million fully diluted shares. For the full year 2016, while it is still early in the year, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.505 billion to 1.52 billion, up 23% year over year at the midpoint. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion, up 24% year over year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 73%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 15%. Our investments in the business have laid the groundwork for future growth and profitability. We believe, going forward, we can show consistent operating margin expansion of approximately 1% per year towards our target model of 20% or better exiting 2020. We expect to do this mainly through increased sales productivity and return on marketing investments as well as through the benefits of expanding with our current and future base of customers. We believe we could achieve this level of margin expansion while still investing for share gains and future growth. Finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.67 to $0.69 per share based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 183 million to 185 million fully diluted shares. In closing, I'd like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that, Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Let's go ahead and hit it right on the metric, the 15% growth in the high-end of the U.S. enterprise, you still showed, you know, I think 29% organic growth in billings and obviously better reported billings. So I guess the question is, that high-end enterprise, does that include or exclude service provider which is then probably a stronger point for you and even though that metric is going away, do you still think there is opportunity for improvement in the growth in that segment? Ken Xie : Sure, sterling, it does not include any carrier business in at a time enterprise number, so that's point one. We do see opportunity there, you know, we believe, you know, we have been really working at the top end of the business as we talked about. We believe, you know, with the marketing investments we're making on market awareness, lead generation and enablement and as well as just increased productivity of the sales investments in the Americas will pay off over time. There is really a broad market we don't believe we've tapped, so to speak or penetrated and that is the broader mid-market and that is the idea as we go to a more regional alignment, if you will. Sterling Auty : And then in terms - one follow-up question would be, you guys have been the strongest vendor in the mid-market in terms of your origin and then you came up into the service provider. You talked last quarter about I guess solidifying your position with increased investments for 2016 in the core where you have been strongest. Any highlight of what the investment philosophy for 2016 to do that would be? Michelle Spolver : Sterling, it is Michelle. I will correct that because I think the perception of Fortinet through the years, when we talked about enterprise, is that we're strong in the mid-market. And that wasn't necessarily true. We're strong in enterprises internationally which there is a lot of mid-market enterprises internationally in the U.S. ours was in the carrier and the SMB space. When we addressed enterprise a lot of that was at the top end. We have been able to grow and do more of that in the last two years. We were doing some business in mid-market but that wasn't our strongest area. It is something that was a misperception put out by Fortinet but it wasn't actually true. The opportunity, we see an opportunity across the enterprise. Drew Del Matto : I mean, Sterling, look, I believe what we have been saying is that when we made the investment, when we hired sales people and probably didn't make as much marketing investments as we made recently the sales people, the migrate toward the top end. That is where the big deals are, right? As they do that, that worked really well. We took down some very impressive logos and expanded those. I think we shared a lot of those stats. I think that part is very impressive. The other part we're sort of coming down from the carrier space if you will to that end of the market. We were coming up from the SMB space. I think that a more market driven motion. That is the adjustment we're trying to make going forward. Ken Xie : We were very successfully internationally both on the enterprise SMB that is where bring some of the practice international make it a more global structure will also help in growing enterprise. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : I am pleased to see margins will be up and really like that you're now talking about a steady ramp of margins. After last quarters are [indiscernible], can you be specific as possible where you get the switch over getting leverage this year and how that is going to be sustainable? Ken Xie : We have the technology like I mentioned, to enable us to have like a better rich feature and at the same time like a performance compared to competitor. So that give us keep expanding and keeping improving the margin there. And also there is a new opportunity like I said is the internal segmentation firewall that is expanding beyond the traditional firewall. That is mostly in the high-end high speed environment. That is also helping the margins. Drew Del Matto : You know, first of all, you're probably - I do think you're seeing a shift of higher margin shifts and even software in there and those generate higher margins. It is cheaper to land and expand. And if you look at the people that we've had - sorry, I had that backwards. Cheaper to expand and land definitely or more efficiency to expand the land. The other piece of it is that we made a lot of headcount especially in the U.S. and we think we could see productivity gains there with marketing and also some returns on those investments as well. Those investments, you know, really have been made. You know, we will continue to make some investments but you know we will be able to moderate those based on the opportunities we see and the level of growth we see. You know, all of that - you know what we've seen also, one of the reasons we focus on the customer lifetime value statistic, it proves out the model, the more of these accounts you acquire, the revenue rich and higher end opportunities, you do have an opportunity to expand, we're very focused on the margin within those accounts and managing that so that we do provide that return and show that in the P&L. You know, just a couple of other points I'd make, we merged with - or we acquired Meru, really in, you know, second week of July I think roughly. And during that time we were, you know, we managed through about $13 million of dilution and we just carried that over. We made some adjustments and we feel pretty confident when we want to make adjustments we can make those adjustments and that gives us a bit of a tail wind in thought here so to speak. And we will scale the other areas G&A and legal. There is room to scale those. And, you know, you make it a point out of those longer term. But we do see leverage in the model. It is primarily on the sales and marketing line. Get a little bit hopefully a point from the gross margin longer term as you shift into higher margin recurring revenue stream. Michael Turits : I got a follow-up, I was going to ask a standard question a lot of us have been asking. Do you see a change in the qualitative spending margin to something diversified or urgent away from that security spend? Drew Del Matto : I think some of the legal enterprise take a little bit longer trying to make a decision. And but overall security is still very important for the business there, for on line there. So we don't see much slowdown overall but some bigger decision may be more careful to make some decision. Ken Xie : You know, I think, Michael, maybe one way to think about it is there has been a lot of change in organizations. We wanted to point out the growth in cyber security related job postings related to IT job postings as a whole. The number is three or even north of that. So I think that brings change in organizations. If you look at the last couple of years, perhaps there was buying a lot of firewalls and people catching up, so to speak. As you look forward it becomes more strategic. You bring these new people in and you think they think more strategically. And the key here is the cyber security platform. The ability to integrate APT framework through the network, into the end point, I think is critical. And to do that organically so that it really all works together seamlessly is what we uniquely provide. We do view that as tremendous opportunity. As Ken said, we have been talking about internal segmentation firewall, we do that with the highest level form man's, best ease of deployment and feel like we really are superior versus the competition. Those are the types of strategic opportunities customers are looking for and I think we shared some of those examples. Ken Xie : And also some of the point solution we see year goes to the high-end of customer also have this advantage of some of the integrated solution like whether the platform because enterprise consider what is the cost to manage total security infrastructure, so that's more advantage for the integrated solution or solution compared to a point solution. Traditionally only the very high-end customer can afford for some point solution, manage each of the point solution [indiscernible] goes away. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Melissa Gorham of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Tom Mao [ph] calling in for Melissa. In terms of ASP increases how do you think that has impacted this quarter's results and how exactly do you expect that to flow through 2016? Drew Del Matto : Sure, Tom. You know, it has an impact. I think what you do is you see a higher mix of services. It is interesting on the revenue line I think the mix of, I think it is 51% services to 49 product is not out of line kind of with history. When you look at the billings, I think it is more weighted to the services side, as well. And even some software. You know, one other thing I would point out, we have been seeing higher sales of software which is a good thing, higher margin. And some of that actually ends up on the services line as well because it is a rateable accounting or rateable accounting recognition. To answer your question, definitely more of a shift in the bundles, one of the things we're also doing, you know, we've announced an enterprise bundle which is an even higher price point than the UTM bundle, you know, where we did the price increase a year ago. And that includes advanced protection and end point security as well. And, you know, that's really just coming up to speed now. And so we're purposely pointing that way because, again and that is a higher margin. Unidentified Analyst : Just to quickly follow up on that. You talked a lot about how you're seeing high demand for the internal firewalls, is that a meaningful business today? And does the capability offered in the new operating system, you know, expect to meaningfully accelerate that? Ken Xie : This is Ken. I think it is very meaning for a lot of enterprise, because like I say nowadays the traditional only protect the parameter, with all the mobility, agent based, using the compromise the mobile device. So that's where we see the market. We started to see two years ago the internal firewall. Traditionally internal is all were open, switch ticketing together. So we see it is a huge market. We don't have the data from the leading research firm, yet, but my estimate for the enterprise that is probably the same market or even bigger long term as the traditional parameter of firewall. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal : Two quick questions on my end. Drew, on saving marketing, as you think of further think of sales force globally, will it be more U.S. focused or more European focused? You guys have done a phenomenal job in Europe and solid results in the U.S. How does it figure out between the breakout between the EMEA and U.S. or Americas. Drew Del Matto : Secondly, the way we're thinking about it, is that we will continue to invest. And, you know, we're doing extremely well internationally and, again, that motivates us from the changes we're making in the leadership. Because that team is experienced. They have depth in our products. They have depth in our markets. They have really been successful in all of the SNB, not just the top end. We hope to mimic that or carry that over into the U.S. We've made a lot of sales and marketing investments in the U.S. We continue to make some. But personally we're really more focused on productivity at this point in the U.S. In realizing the investments we made there, maturing those. And also, making sure the organization, giving the organizational changes take hold, that is how we think about the U.S. Broader international EMEA remains a great market for us. APJ we see some opportunities. The only cautionary factor I would throw out there right now is obviously there is some turmoil in world markets, you know, just the global economy and what's going on there. So we do have an ounce of caution in terms of that and I think we will be smart where we're investing in the face of that until we figure out what that means. Shaul Eyal : In hindsight - what is the time frame it takes, sales guy or lady coming on board for Fortinet to become fully productive? Is it a quarter? Two quarters? Maybe even three quarters? Drew Del Matto : Well, you know, I would say on average it is probably closer to - you know, it's slightly longer than six months, let's say. It is the bottom end of the market, more channel driven end. The sales cycle can be 90 days so it is really just kind of getting up to speed on the products and ramping up. It is never as easy as 90 day, right? You have to give people a month to kind of, you know, find their way around, so to speak. And then at the high-end if they're more focused on calling a large financial institution, that is an investment that can take a year or even two years. On balance, somewhere slightly more than six months is how we model it. I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gray Powell : Maybe a question on margins, we often get a lot of questions on the operating profile and investments you're making. If I look at free cash flow as a percentage of revenue it improved to 24% in 2015, that is up from 20% the last couple of years. As you make your way back to the longer goal of 20% operating margins, how much of that should flow through to free cash flow and can we see free cash flow margins getting back to 20% or maybe 30% range? Drew Del Matto : I don't have a lot of guidance other than near-term, you know, CapEx guidance to give you on free cash flow. You know, I do - there is no plan to do anything with the free cash flow kind of out of our normal trend, though. It would just be more of the CapEx, I think, basically CapEx and, yes, real estate. I think near term we're finishing an ERP project this year and that will go away somewhere in the middle of the year. Gray Powell : And maybe one follow-up, I think you mentioned the impact of Meru in the second half of the year. You said that was like 13 million of operating dilution? I just want to make sure I had the number correct. Drew Del Matto : Yes, I think when we merged - the way it was modeled would suggest, you know, had we done nothing or what they were losing, the extrapolation was $13 million of dilution pretty much we did it through restructuring and best practices. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalla of Barclays. Your line is now open. Saket Kalla : So, first, for Ken or Drew, a lot to talk about the platform approach outside of FortiGate or outside of FortiGate. Can you remind us how the mix of billings has maybe evolved around FortiGate or non-FortiGate over the last couple of years. Michelle Spolver : I mean, you're asking Ken and drew and Michelle is answering. But I don't have the numbers right in front of me. It is definitely growing. We called out some, you know, all of the products are growing. Some are growing more than others and called out a few that we've seen some good growth on. Some of those would be FortiMail, FortiSandbox, for sure. FortiDOS. And FortiAP. It is still now a non-material portion of our revenue but it's growing as our overall revenue is getting bigger as well. The other thing I think, too, is that - some of the subscriptions - subscription revenue that's coming in, in terms of billings, most of that applies to FortiGate. Some can apply to some of the other ones. Some don't have the FortiCard bundles attached to it. Drew Del Matto : Yes, there is so much about the platform even if you're FortiGate. There was an earlier question about the importance of internal segmentation firewalls and I think it was a more tactical question to be frank. But from a strategic perspective, you're landing a feet by having that security. Even if you're selling the first FortiGate, at the end of the day you're really selling that platform because the opportunity for them to expand, you know, to APT, to the end point, to wireless, you know, that is the vision that we're selling. You know, again, we're certainly working on the marketing to make sure that message is out there. It does certainly work in the top end of the business - top end of the enterprise, that is where we have been very successful. You know, that story resonates at that level. Our goal is to ensure that resonates across all the business. Saket Kalla : And just for my follow-up. Can you just recap the changes in the sales structure? I know we've got new leadership and, Drew, you said U.S. enterprises are getting split into multi-national and regional. But are there any other changes being made structurally and do you feel like you accounted from any other dis rip shun of the change in the guidance appropriately? Ken Xie : This is Ken. No, we have one lead e global leader, for the sales and supporting compared in the past two parallel structure there. That is what help to improving the productivity and also to manage a lot of the bigger global account better. And also we defined the sum of the dot-com to be more efficient and also more local, locally handle some of the smaller compared to many layer in the past, mostly in the U.S. basically. So that's also we feel will be improving the productivity and that's the practice we use in the international in the past, but U.S. is a huge market, right? And then in the past we probably have quite some different layer. Now we try to make sure it is more addressed locally vision and at the same time global account will be addressed globally. That is under one leadership we have two different structure in the past. Drew Del Matto : Just to add on to that, first of all, we absolutely have accounted for that in guidance. As we have the global economic condition, I think those are two obvious things that we need to account for and we believe we did. You know, the only other thing I would say adding on to Ken's comments, change is always a challenge. Any time you change leaders and organizations it is a challenge and it absolutely comes with the risk of disruption. I would say this, we've hired some very experienced professionals and the people we're bringing over, leadership change, Patrice and Holly, our CMO are working together very well. I think it all stems from the top. What I've seen to date in terms of strategy, execution, you know, the progress and their plan to make it, makes a lot of sense and they seem to be doing extremely well. And so, again, I think we have to have some level of caution to see how that takes hold. But I would say, you know, feels like we have the right people in place doing the right things getting to the right end. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of UBS Brent Thill : Drew, just a follow-on the sales changes. I just want to be clear that that sales force reorg, the shape that you're talking about, putting the sales force in, that is now complete in January. That's behind you. You don't anticipate changes throughout Q1. Drew Del Matto : It's pretty much behind, Brent. To be fair there is always - I think at the - the middle and top end of the sales organization that is always fair. There is always some adjustment it is more at the rep level or, you know, feet on the street level. Most of those are behind us at this point. I'm assuming your question was as of January 1. And there's been a lot that has happened. Mostly aligned up to that point and then there was a little bit I think left to go in the earlier part of January. But we're pretty much I think locked and loaded at this point. Brent Thill : Okay. And when you talk about the mid-market initiatives and the things that you'd like to have there, if you had a couple things that you could wave your magic wand and appear in that mid-market initiative, what are the things that you think are important milestones that you would like to pass there, you know, whether, you know, it's you name the metric. I'm just curious what you think you need there to get it where you would like to see it. Drew Del Matto : Sure. You know, first of all, I think the first thing you want to see is an uptick in awareness. And that is measurable. We have actively been measuring that. We have been very focused on awareness initiatives, if you will. Ooh I don't want to get too specific to give too much away to competitors, but we have been very focused there. The second piece is funneled. Lot of this is lead gen. It helped build the funnel. That would be the second thing. And then ultimately what you're looking at here is productivity. We've made some investments in sales and marketing and, you know, specifically in the U.S. and, you know, I'm really focused on productivity at this point. So that's what I'm looking for. And the sooner I see that uptick, the better. I feel pretty good as it is, don't get me wrong but that is the indicator you look for. Ken Xie : Also relatively new in the U.S. how to make them quickly and at the same time working mostly with part of the company structure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Fish : It is actually Jim on for Walter. Drew, first can you discuss the transformation of the deals for the channel this past year versus when you started at the company including sort of where the mix is at between channel versus at this point? Drew Del Matto : Well, everything goes through a channel. I think perhaps the way to answer the question is where are we doing more direct touch? And everything is in direct. Almost everything, probably a few things but business is primarily indirect, two tier distribution through distributor and value added reseller or similar type of partner. And so the where we're touching more directly is at the high-end of the business. A lot of as we talk about when the sales people came in, they focused more on the top end. Obviously, because that is where the opportunity-rich customers are. And so that where is they are and they are direct calling with sales engineers and, you know, in some cases large - fairly large teams to, you know, win in some of these larger accounts. Jim Fish : And then my follow-up would be on the capital return why not go beyond the 200 million you announced given the cash you had especially domestically? Drew Del Matto : Yes, we feel very comfortable with the 200 million. When we look at capital strategy we're very focused on first growth and that could be - we've clearly been investing organically in growth. And, you know, we're going to continues to do that but also inorganically those opportunities may or may not arise. We have nothing to mention on the horizon. Nothing specific to mention there but we're keeping our options open on that front as we continue to look for opportunities. And then we have been doing some buy back and you can look at the level we have been doing those. The $200 million gives us a nice window to do some of that. You know, were we GO to get aggressive we can do back for more, 200 million is what we did in the past. That number feels about right for now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Zeller of Needham. Your line is now open. Scott Zeller : I wanted to ask about the recent headlines we've seen regarding Verizon and others selling data center assets. Can you tell us how that would impact your business and how material it might be selling into those data center assets? Just some color, please. Drew Del Matto : We have a very strong position with a carrier on service provider and also you see the strong growth in last quarter also like I mentioned before how to secure mobile securities also key driver for behind because I feel best way to secure mobile go through service provider is traditional end point load lot of software in the device itself. For some carrier they may change the strategy like for the data center, but I don't feel they slow down the investment on the security mobile device and the other part of it and we still see as a strong growth opportunity in the care service provider space and data center I feel some application go to maybe specific company whether certain eCommerce or certain company they have a certain application maybe centralizing player but it is on the mobile security that's where we have the strong demand and keeping on the strong investment and that is also keeping driving the business there. Scott Zeller : And then the performance in Asia is quite good. Any color specifically around China that you would like to share? Drew Del Matto : We don't have a big business in China. We shared that in the business. We do some business there, but I would not at all call that a meaningful part of our business. You know, the issue with China is probably more the global economic conditions. You know, we thought - what we said a quarter ago was probably more emerging market commodity driven economies. But now they're just - we're a little more concerned just given that China, the situation may - we don't know obviously - but looks like it could be more serious than people thought three months ago and, you know, they have some big trading partners in Europe and across Asia. So that gives us a little - that's really where we would have more concern about China so to speak, outside of China, with the wake of what their economy could bring. Ken Xie : Also, we have the technology product to have much better price performance function compared to others because the technology the problem solution. So the lower the total management cost. I think that's where in some downturn we have seen in 2008, 2009, that was a good opportunity to keeping gaining market share. So that's where we see this more as opportunity going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Erik Suppiger : My first question is, some of your peers talked about the move to public cloud services like Office 365 as negatively impacting demand and the SMB in particular. Are you guys seeing SMBs move to the cloud in accelerated pace? If so, how is that impacting your low end business. In general it would be nice to hear how cloud is impacting your large business and mid-market as well? Drew Del Matto : We have not seen the slowdown or changing of the SMB and also the CP device. But we also see strong growth in the virtualized cloud environment. We have the technology we can put a whole system into a single chip as you will see. That is actually driving a lot of strong growth in the branch office SMB, device. But on the other side, like we major cloud provider see some nice grow in there. And, like I said, we have end point, network side, application and to the cloud. That is where the five piece land up quite well together. So that is what we see all the five pieces kind of sell together, grow together, is advantage we have. Erik Suppiger : I just had one follow judgment I just kind of wanted to touch on the global macro conditions. I think everyone is a little bit concerned over what's going on globally. You guys are reporting some pretty good strength in your international businesses. Can you talk about how you're viewing or how you're seeing economic conditions play out? Are you seeing any cracks at all? Can you walk us through the trouble areas, like South America, Russia and Canada, what you saw there? Drew Del Matto : Yes, we didn't see a lot of issues, quite frankly we felt we had good quarters there. I would say our concerns are more forward focused we talked about with potentially China's you know any country or region that would have big exposure to trading with China. We didn't see it. I think part of it is the fact that, you know, we do have great products. I think our go to market motion internationally has been spot-on especially in EMEA. And, you know, I do attribute you know our success there very much to our team there and, you know, we feel - we feel like we could continue to do well there. Quite frankly, obviously the global economic condition is something we all want to watch and so we hopefully have, you know, taken appropriate caution there. Ken Xie : Yes, also, like I said in my script, is that a lot of emerging market like I mentioned, APAC, we're already number one in the network security and keeping growth faster than our competitor because very strong product technology and strong with the right strategy. We're keeping growth faster than all other competitors. So that is where we bring some of the practice, the experience come from, from oversea to U.S. now and we also for improving our execution going forward to grow faster. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : One question for Ken, in segmentation firewall which major competitors do you expect to see head to head and how quickly will pick up in 2016? Ken Xie : Internal segmentation firewall mostly deployed as like the called switch mode, transparent mode, in an environment and will 10x to 100x faster than the traditional firewall. But most of the switching networking company don't have these security capability on the networking device switch and no router in there and traditional like security company which is software based is also have performance need and also how to deploy in the switch mode. So that\u2019s where we don't see much competitor here and we see is an opportunity and we have huge advantage. So that's where we see is a - we have the best technology and timing to keeping investment grow in this space. Unidentified Analyst : And follow up quickly the opportunity realized in 2016, whether it will be meaningful or would it be meaningful in the second half? How should we think about that? Ken Xie : I think we identify this market two years ago and we keeping educated market in improving the product and both with ASIC and also the OS we announced today. Still a bit difficult to ask me how quickly the market growing, but from what I talked with the customer, long term they see especially in enterprise probably bigger than the traditional firewall market because nowadays they feel traditional way to deploy a few firewall is no longer secure enough so they need to move internally secure segment department different server but how quickly they adopt and how quickly they can maybe deploy where the company, deploy the switch, still difficult to say, but I think is that so far adopt pretty quick when the customer see the benefit they really like the approach given the actual protection. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back to Michelle Spolver for closing remarks. Michelle Spolver : I just want to say thanks to everybody. We\u2019re trying to keep our call shorter and so we did. This time we will have a second call at 3.30, so if you digest the information we gave you today, feel free to call back in at 3.30, happy to answer the remaining questions. That's it. Thank you very much. Drew Del Matto : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

A replay of this call will also be available on our website. With that, let me now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Michelle, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today to discuss our first quarter 2016 results. I'm very pleased to share that we have a strong start to the year. Our 30% year-over-year growth in billings in the first quarter highlight our ability to consistently outgrow and take share in the network security market. Fortinet's base of customers is now over 270,000, approximately 9,000 of which were landed during the first quarter. And IDC research show that more Fortinet network security appliances are deployed worldwide than any others. Our strategy of acquiring important new customers is working and our expansion opportunity is significant. There are several industry trends that are and will be important drivers of our business. Cyber threats are continuing at an alarming rate and our network's perimeter is growing due to the growing adoption of the mobility cloud application and the Internet of Things. This is keeping security at the top of IT spending priorities, resulting in customers taking a fresh look at a legacy infrastructure and driving meaningful shift in the market. First, enterprises are favoring a consolidated security platform that integrates multiple technology, products and service for improved security and a reduced complexity. This very notion is Fortinet's mission since we founded the company 16 years ago. Second, enterprises are increasingly circumventing their network and deploying internal firewall to protect key resources, such as customer or patient records, finance data, or research and development information, and third, they are evaluating how to secure application and the data in the cloud. All of these shifts benefit Fortinet. We are one of the only vendors with the breadth of the solution to address this need and we do it with the best technology and constantly innovation. The internal segmentation firewall trend we identified nearly two years ago is gaining traction and helping us land new customers and cross-sell to existing customers. We continue to see healthy enterprise demand globally for high end and mid range FortiGate appliance deployed as internal segmentation firewall. We worked many of these type of deals during the quarter, including a seven-figure expansion deal with a large public health organization and a large prolonged (5:02) deal with a global evaluation (5:04) company. In both cases, our high-end FortiGate product outperformed competition on both security features and performance. Fortinet's ability to offer firewall performance and switching speed, which is the key criteria for internal segmentation, is an advantage competitors cannot match. On the consolidation front, yesterday, Fortinet announced our Security Fabric, which weave together our highly advanced security for the endpoint access layer, network, application, data center and the cloud. This can be seen on slide three. Through this integrated Security Fabric, we protect the expanding attack surface with a single unified operation system that can be managed through a single pane of glass. This reduced operational complexity and TCO, but also improved security by enabling direct communication between solutions for a unified and rapid response to threats. Our Fabric has several key attributes, including scalability to protect entire attack surface from IoT to the cloud and wire speed. Awareness to behave as a single policy and a logging entity enabling end-to-end network segmentation for visibility, inspection and control of network traffic. Security through global and local threat intelligence should act across products to reduce time to protect and an open framework to integrate with an ecosystem of third-party solutions, enabling customers to maximize their existing infrastructure and security investments. At Fortinet, we take innovation very seriously. This is proven by third-party test of our product and by our intellectual property portfolio of more than 300 issued and 250 pending patents. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in technologies which help power and enhance our Security Fabric, and enhance our customers to implement internal segmentation, cloud and other innovative security strategies capable of deliver seamless, comprehensive threat protection across the expanding attack surface. Yesterday, we announced the FortiGate 6000 and 2000 product family, which are the first to integrate our ninth generation FortiASIC content processor, CP9, and significantly reached (7:58) next-generation firewall, IPS SSL VPN performance. I'm especially excited about FortiGate's 6000E family, the newest and most powerful addition to our product line, and geared to meet highest performance requirement of large enterprise and service providers. (8:18) 6000 series encompasses FortiASIC CP9 processor, as well as significant advance in hardware design system performance, and the ability to deliver more than double the next-generation firewall performance of our existing high-end system. The first model being announced in 6000 series is the FortiGate 6040E, which is capable of delivering 320-gig of firewall and 80-gig of the next-generation firewall support. Over the next few years, we will be refreshing our entire line of (8:57) enterprise and carrier-class FortiGate system with the CP9 processor, and continuously extending our performance and technology lead. Fortinet has a strong technology advantage and a visionary roadmap in place to help us continue to grow our market position and address a huge opportunity. Our mission has always been to deliver the most innovative and integrate highest performance security solution across the whole IT infrastructure. We are seeing this play out in the market now, and we are well-positioned to continue to grow and take market share from competitors. I will now turn the call to Drew, to review our financial results of Q1 2016. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. Fortinet started 2016 on a strong note, with the first quarter exceeding our guidance across all key metrics : billings, revenue, operating margin and EPS. We're especially pleased with our sales execution and the return on our marketing investments, which helped drive our billings growth 30%. This represents 3x the growth of the security market. This also illustrates a smooth recent realignment and very nice execution by our sales force, especially given the economic headwinds in Latin America. We enter 2016 with an excellent start with our new go-to-market structure. We're generating significant growth while increasing profitability, and are demonstrating scale leverage in our model. Fortinet also continues to generate substantial free cash flow, while still investing for growth. Let me now share our financial results for the first quarter, which can be seen on slide four. As I mentioned, Fortinet's billings increased 30% year-over-year to $330 million, exceeding our guided range of $315 million to $322 million. Total revenue of $285 million was up 34% year-over-year and above our guided range of $270 million to $275 million. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $837 million, up 39% year-over-year, exceeding our billings growth. This illustrates our ability to sell our margin-rich recurring subscriptions and services. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, above our guided range of 8% to 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.12, also above our guidance. We continue to invest in line with our strategy to drive growth, but show gradual operating leverage as we grow in scale. Our gross margin was strong at 74%, which was also above our guided range of 72% to 73%. This was driven by sales of higher value subscription bundles. And finally, our cash generation continues to grow, as evidenced by the $71 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter. Fortinet continues to outgrow the network security market by a wide margin and take share. This is a trend we expect to continue, as enterprises increasingly shift to integrated security platforms and value premium technology. We continue to both land new customers and also win substantial expansion deals with existing ones, due to the strength and performance of our broad and integrated Security Fabric. We have many more enterprise customers today than we had in the past, illustrating our investment strategy is paying off. We see ample opportunity to expand our presence within our installed base and drive a continuously higher customer lifetime value. Our acquisition of new customers and ability to expand sales within our growing installed base provides broad opportunities for future growth and leverage in our model for years to come. As Ken mentioned, complexity and extension of networks from IoT to cloud has caused the attack surface to increase dramatically, and security is now borderless. Enterprises want strategic security partners who can provide a broad and integrated platform of solutions, versus numerous vendors and disparate products that solve only a small part of the problem. This integration, or Security Fabric, improves security, reduces deployment and management complexity, and saves on operational costs. Our Security Fabric uniquely positions Fortinet. This weaves together our products, services and partnerships to provide seamless protection at all points in the network, from endpoint to data center to cloud. Our fabric delivers integrated scalability, awareness, security, and openness, both from the cloud and for the cloud. This is a strategic consideration for our customers, as they move from the limited capabilities of point products or incumbents lacking the necessary innovation or integration capabilities. We expect this consolidation trend and framework to be a meaningful business driver and expansion opportunity for us going forward given the key disruptive vectors of more cloud, mobility and proliferation of inherently insecure IoT devices. We are already seeing the beginnings of this materialize today. Billings of non-FortiGate products outpaced overall billings growth during the quarter, with the highest growth coming from our FortiSandbox ATP appliances and virtual software offerings, which grew over 270% year-over-year. The majority of our FortiSandbox deals also include our FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiWeb and FortiClient products to serve as a framework for protecting advanced threats at multiple areas of the network. Some of the multi-product deals won during the quarter included a deal with a large international telecommunications company that selected our FortiSandbox and FortiMail appliances to extend their FortiGate deployment. Together, these products provide an ATP framework for protecting against advanced threats at the perimeter, core and mail server. We also won a multi-product deal with a large and very well-recognized global automotive corporation that is a long time Fortinet customer. We expanded in this account, winning a deal to secure a large division with a combination of numerous FortiGate, FortiWiFi, FortiAP and other Fortinet products. These wins exemplify the value of our Security Fabric to customers and to Fortinet's growth opportunity. And though still in early stages, cloud adoption also represents a significant expansion opportunity. As you could see on slide five, Fortinet delivers security for the cloud and from the cloud. We support all major cloud deployment scenarios, whether public, private or hybrid, giving customers the ability to choose and migrate when and where they want. The move to the cloud continues to be a long-term driver for our business. Customers recognized Fortinet's distinct advantage in providing a unified security posture through a common operating system across IoT to cloud. The vast majority of cloud deployments are a hybrid of physical and virtual, partly due to the need for high performance. In cloud scenarios, high security performance for north-south traffic is extremely important. IoT devices are typically headless or lacking any security intelligence. The ability to secure applications in the cloud and IoT devices at the access layer and within the network is an emerging necessity. Fortinet plays uniquely well here, given our strong performance advantage and integrating network and secure access technology that competitors just can't offer. As a result, our cloud and virtual business again grew significantly, and though off a small base, this represented one of the fastest growing areas of our business. Some first quarter cloud wins included landing a first seat at the table of a global software vendor for a hybrid cloud to data center deployment in a Microsoft Azure environment. And we also expanded with an existing Fortinet customer for a hybrid cloud deployment in an AWS environment. For both deals, we sold a combination of our virtual security products and high-end data center appliances. Critical to both were our unified Security Fabric and operating systems across the hybrid environment of cloud and premise-based deployments, coupled with a single pane of glass management and unmatched performance for the data center. And lastly, we expanded with an existing telecommunications customer that selected Fortinet for its cloud migration project. This included upgrading competitive firewalls and adding virtual firewalls for an AWS environment. We expect continued expansion opportunities with this customer as we help them implement their hybrid cloud strategy. Our service provider business was also very strong during the quarter. Fortinet counts nearly every major service provider in the world as a customer. This was due to our ability to deliver the very highest levels of performance, security, advanced networking and deployment flexibility. This combination allows telcos to offer an array of managed services, including fully hosted security, private hosted cloud or customer premise-based security services. One of the service provider deals won during the quarter was one with a very large North American carrier for a major network firewall upgrade for its MSSP offering. We also won a deal with a U.S. service provider that purchased our FortiSandbox appliances to deliver a managed ATP service. Finally, I'd like to highlight that we had numerous large subscription and support renewal deals with existing Fortinet customers. Our renewal rates, which are tracked by appliances, not customers, remain in the mid-70% range and exclude product refresh and upgrade purchases. Our customer retention rate continues to be above 90%, which demonstrates overall customer satisfaction as well as the stickiness of our solutions. Our high renewal and retention rates also show that we are not only winning numerous customers from incumbents, but we're keeping them. Our base of large deals is growing and is larger today than ever before. During Q1, the number of large deals grew in all categories. Deals over $100,000 grew 43%; deals over $250,000 grew 28%; and deals over $500,000 grew 43%. Our breakdown of billings across our top five verticals was service provider at 22%, government at 14%, financial services at 10%, education at 6% and retail at 7%. Now, let me turn to the geographic breakdown of billings for Q1. Americas billings grew 29%, EMEA billings grew 30% and APAC billings grew 32%. In the Americas, the U.S. performed well and Canada rebounded and saw strength for the first time in several quarters. Excluding Latin America, North America grew in the mid-30% range year-over-year. As we cautioned in our guidance commentary in January, we saw weakness in Latin America, primarily resulting from economic headwinds as well as political headwinds in Brazil. EMEA delivered another exceptional quarter, growing an impressive 30% year-over-year. We continued to see early investments in growth pay-off, especially in northern Europe and emerging markets like Africa and the Middle East. In APAC, we grew an impressive 32% year-over-year and performed well across the region. Japan, which represents the largest portion of our APAC business, performed especially well. We are seeing returns on our sales and marketing investments in all regions. We're pleased with our new global sales structure and the team's execution during the first quarter of realignment. This enabled us to better source, win and support multi-national enterprises. Our marketing investment strategy is progressing nicely. With an expanded and seasoned team, we have improved public awareness activities and significantly increased the amount of end user events, demand generation campaigns and lead qualification resources. We remain committed to this strategy. Now, turning to billings by product segment on slide six, we continued to see diversity of product billings across all segments and strength among our high-end FortiGate products, which accounted for 37% of total product billings. This indicates strong sales to large enterprises and service providers. Our mid-range enterprise products accounted for 28% of the total mix and our entry-level products accounted for 35%. Total revenue was $285 million during the first quarter, up 34% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guided range. Revenue performance was driven by the combination of 28% year-over-year product revenue growth and 39% year-over-year services revenue growth. Our richer subscription bundles and corresponding price increases is helping drive services revenue growth. On a geographic basis, you could see on slides seven and eight, the revenues continue to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. In the Americas, revenues grew 31% to $120 million, EMEA revenues grew 39% to $105 million, and APAC revenues grew 29% to $59 million. Moving to non-GAAP expenses and profitability, during the first quarter, our non-GAAP gross profit margin was 74%, above our guided range of 72% to 73%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 61%, up 340 basis points over the first quarter of last year. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 84%, an increase of 150 basis points over last year and highlighting the margin expansion opportunity of our FortiGuard and FortiCare subscription offering, which also provide valuable recurring revenue streams. Non-GAAP gross margin was again positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as our VM line, our virtualized security solutions, and the impact of recent price increases on our FortiGuard security subscription bundles I just mentioned. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $180 million during the first quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $30 million, or 11% of total revenue. This was above our guided range of 8% to 9% and primarily driven by the revenue and gross margin overperformance. As a result, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was also above our guidance at $20 million, or $0.12 per share, based on 174 million diluted shares outstanding. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 2016 remained 34%. As seen on slide 10, we ended Q1 with a strong balance sheet, including $1.194 billion in cash and investments. Our $71 million of free cash flow included $19 million in real estate purchases to support growth and $11 million in other capital expenditures, including our ERP project. Our free cash flow is strong and increasing, even as we invest in the company to support growth, while delivering returns to shareholders. Annualized inventory turns for Q1 were 2.1, in line with our annualized goal of two or better. Deferred revenue increased to $837 million, up $237 million, or 39%, year-over-year and $46 million sequentially. Finally, during the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of stock for approximately $50 million at an average price of $24.97. As of the end of March, we've repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for a total of approximately $188 million at an average price of $24.87 since the inception of the buyback programs. $150 million remains under the new $200 million share repurchase program announced in January of 2016. Now, let me finish with our guidance for the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements including all of the guidance statements provided are subject to Michelle's cautions at the start of this call. Fortinet's market opportunity and competitive advantage is significant. Our investments have helped lay the foundation for our future growth, increasing profitability and free cash flow, as we continue to scale Fortinet to be a multi-billion dollar business. We are well-positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds, such as security product consolidation, network segmentation and cloud with our end-to-end Security Fabric. Additionally, we are embarking on the beginning of the new FortiGate product refresh cycle with our FortiASIC CP9 which further strengthens our performance lead and competitive advantage. On the execution front, our recent sales realignment and investments are bearing fruit, and our salespeople are motivated. However, some of the changes made in January are still early given sales cycles often extend beyond six months, and we think it'll take a bit more time for the benefits to fully materialize. Additionally, we're still facing challenges in certain regions such as Latin America. It's prudent for us to factor all of this into our forward outlook. During Q2, we expect billings to be in the range of $365 million to $370 million, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $301 million to $306 million, up 27% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 73%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 12%. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.14 based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 176 million to 178 million fully diluted shares. Turning to guidance for the full year 2016, we're increasing billings, revenue and EPS expectations. This accounts for our first quarter overperformance and continuing confidence in our market opportunity while considering the cautionary factors I just mentioned. Billings are now expected to be in the range of $1.520 billion to $1.530 billion, up 24% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase from the $1.505 billion to $1.520 billion we previously estimated. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.262 billion to $1.272 billion, up 26% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase from our prior guidance of $1.250 billion to $1.260 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 73%. And we're maintaining our non-GAAP operating margin guidance of approximately 15%. We remain committed to our strategy of investing for growth, as well as showing margin expansion. We believe our investments will benefit us long-term from a growth and customer life-time value perspective, enabling us to drive scale leverage over time. Finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.69 per share to $0.71 per share based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 180 million fully diluted shares to 182 million fully diluted shares. This is up from our previous guidance of $0.67 per share to $0.69 per share. In closing, I'd like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that, Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator, you may start the Q&A. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of (30:20). Unknown Speaker : A question, and congrats, on the solid results. Maybe just a little more, Ken and Drew, on where you're seeing the traction under the new sales structure, particularly as it pertains to gaining new customers in the mid-range enterprise. And then, Drew, I think in the past, you've talked about looking internally at productivity metrics and sales and marketing. If you could just give us an update there, that would be great. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. This is Ken. I think the global sales infrastructure, like Drew mentioned, starting to benefit a lot for us to manage some bigger account, global account and that's making the customer more comfortable to deploy globally, and also, the partner also can support end customer. Actually also, we started to have the global marketing program, which synchronized all the regions together and helping generate a lead and also helping the training and also position in the marketplace. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And Gabriella (31:24), I mean at the end of the day, we grew 30%, 3x the market. The only place we really saw a drag, so to speak, I would say was Latin America. That was just a tough quarter down there. I mean clearly, economic issues across the region, and then, in Brazil, in particular, not only the economic issues, but political issues and even the Zika virus is probably causing some concern down there. So I mean that was the toughest region for us. We actually felt like transition was smooth given some of the remapping that occurs in a transition and the fact that sales cycles often take anywhere from six months to nine months. So I think taking that all into consideration, we were pretty happy with what we saw. Unknown Speaker : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up if I could. On the last call, when we talked about the full year guidance, I think there was the two risks that you mentioned, the macro and the sales reorganization. Maybe just relative to three months ago, how do you feel about both those two factors and as it pertains to the second half, what are the things that we should be thinking about that could drive upside or downside relative to normal seasonal trends? Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Fair question. In January, we talked about Latin America and that absolutely came to \u2013 we saw that as an issue. It clearly was a headwind in Q1. And we're calling that out going forward. I just spent some time on that, called that out in the script. So that's certainly there. Beyond that, I think what also was happening in January was the stock market. We were \u2013 I think there were some concerns, just not only us, but others, that that might cause a drag just on the economy as a whole, but it seems like that recovery \u2013 that's recovered. So I think that's good. And then, beyond that, I still see some concerns about the Chinese economy. Didn't seem to be much of an issue this quarter, but going forward, if that were to decline or get worse, that could potentially be a headwind for us. We don't have a lot of business in China. It's probably less than 2% of our business, but we'd be more concerned about trading partners, if that created just a broader headwind outside of the country of China itself. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. This is Ken. I think for the world, the market condition in the network security, we see still we're healthy and still keeping growing nicely, especially in the \u2013 we call the internal segmentation. So we see pretty strong demand in there, and also, the new \u2013 we call the Security Fabric, which making the internal security, access, endpoint, cloud, all working together, and that also have a huge demand in the customers partners side. So the market is still healthy, continue to drive the demand, the growth there. And on internal execution side, we go through a few months of change in restructuring. It's all improving, and we feel, probably, second half of this year, we can see even better improving in the result. Unknown Speaker : That's very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Gorham from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Ken, I just wanted to follow up with you on the internal firewall opportunity. So you mentioned a good amount of demand. I'm just wondering if that business is meaningful today, in terms of the financials, and how we should expect that to kind of ramp throughout 2016 and beyond. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, this is a market we identified about two years ago. And we're starting to see it's starting to ramp up pretty quickly, and it's starting to get (35:22) meaningful. We're starting to see like one or (35:24) two research report, they say it will be like a few billion dollars in the next three years to five years, contribute maybe like between 6% to 8% additional growth of the network security market, because the traditional firewall, which only deploy and where companies have Internet connections no longer, in fact, enough, and the mobility, the cloud and the BYOD, starting making up (35:51) that border protection no longer effective. So that's where inside enterprise is starting to deploy a lot of internal segmentation, and also the IoT, probably the only effective way to secure is really through the segmentation there. There are some new reporting to (36:08) come up, but we do believe this will be eventually what drive quite some growth and net adds on the current network security infrastructure. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And just to follow on to that, Melissa, it's Drew. When Ken mentions IoT, it's important to know that most of the devices out there are headless or lacking security, and so, they're going to be \u2013 a lot of those are going to be accessed through network through a wireless layer. And there's really just access controls there. And so, once they're in, the segmentation becomes a very important architecture strategy for companies as those begin to proliferate. So that's just part of the vision going forward, and we're seeing some interest there. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Melissa, it's Michelle. The last thing I wanted to add \u2013 I think the question was, how big of a part of the business internal segmentation firewall is for us? I think the challenge is, is that the products. There essentially are FortiGate high-end products. So it's hard to sort of separate, when you look at a deal and you look at data, if it's being deployed in the core or if it's being deployed as an internal segmentation firewall. We do know, qualitatively, that it is helping drive the business. We can see that in the type of big deals that we win, but we don't have an actual metric to be able to give you on that. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just one last on the sales reorg, so can I just clarify that the changes in terms of the sales organization is fully complete, and now it's just about executing? And then, have you started to see an improvement in growth in your U.S. enterprise business? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, the realignment really has taken place. In terms of the enterprise business, I mean the number we used to give out in the past, quite frankly, was the team that no longer exists. What I would share \u2013 I think I shared in the script that the North America growth was in the mid-30% range. And so, it feels like the realignment went smoothly. We did well, if you look at the large deals or if you look at the product mix, the high end did really well. And those are factors to kind of to show really who's buying the product. So it tends to be larger customers buying the product with the large boxes and again, the large deals tend to be an indicator of that. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: It's probably a few quarter continuous improvement. And also, including those repositioned (38:41) restructured sales force and also keeping invest and also as a marketing team, working closely with the sales team. And so, we do commit to keeping invest in the marketing and sales, especially in the U.S. side and driving the growth, but that's also we want to smooth out the change, make sure it's a \u2013 while we're improving, the same time, maintain the healthy growth. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your question, please. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Drew, not to dwell on the sales force reorg, but can you just remind us what percent of the overall sales and marketing team has been realigned, or it sounds like it's done. But can \u2013 what did you change? Can you just walk through that, mechanics of what those changes were? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. We went to a more regional approach, is what I would say. We basically \u2013 I think the top two things are, one, go to a regional approach and then, peel off the top level for a strategic account team. And so, the regional approach would be, I think you'd have people in the west, the central and the east, for instance, and so that they're closer to the company \u2013 customers, versus flying around the country. One of the things we saw, we give the examples of the financial services team was highly focused in Manhattan, yet there are banks elsewhere and we weren't really covering those, because the teams in the local area would effectively stop (40:30) calling the financial services \u2013 the banks in their region, because they were expecting the financial services people to do it. And we weren't really just getting the scale we needed to touch those customers. So those are really the big changes. And so, when you think about that, there's some remapping and it's not 100%, but there's definitely some remapping of accounts. And that, although it went smoothly, again, just keep in mind that it takes \u2013 probably takes six months to nine months for a sales cycle. So we're still hopeful that that will ramp a bit more. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the whole wireless play and when you talk about the shift to IoT, can you talk a little bit how \u2013 what you're seeing from customers, and how that's starting to impact some of the deals that you see right now? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: This is Ken. I think the IoT, the wireless is really part of the infrastructure. So that's where we talk about, we need to provide the total solution and also consolidate and also integrate together like a fabric. So that's where, I think, we talk about \u2013 we had only vendor contracts from endpoint to the access, wireless, to the IoT, and then, the network side, the data center and the cloud. But all this has to be working together and also managed together, so that's the provision \u2013 the direction we keeping driving right now. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping we could just jump back on the internal segmentation firewall opportunity. How big are those deals, generally speaking, relative to traditional perimeter firewall deals? And then, how long is a typical sales process on internal segmentation? Thanks. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think, like Michelle said, it sometimes, because of the channel, little bit difficult to see how to identify as an internal or as a perimeter security, but for quite a few case, we see a similar size. And because after the \u2013 I think most companies already have the border security, the traditional firewall deployment there. But what they miss is really how to secure internally, so that's where we see \u2013 but internal, you need to deploy like where the switch deployed, and also match the speed of switch, which tend to be 10 times to 100 times faster than the traditional firewall throughput there. So that's where we see, probably, I'd say for the deal size will be similar, if not larger \u2013 something even larger than the traditional perimeter security, in an enterprise environment. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Sorry. Yeah, Gray, it's Michelle. It depends on sort of the size of the customers' network and how much segmentation they want and how many firewalls they want, and then, also the other thing is that they aren't always \u2013 these type of deals aren't always a straight internal segmentation firewall deal. We've talked in the past couple of quarters about landing first feet that were straight internal segmentation firewalls. But it's also an expansion opportunity for us with our existing base. And many times, it includes products for other types of deployments. But I mean they are... Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: ...I mean it could fall in the 100,000 on that, but it's probably not going to be in the million (44:01). Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: And Gray, you also asked about sales cycle. I mean I don't think these are particularly short sales cycles unless it's a follow-on deal. If you follow Michelle's logic, I think, they're just buying more the same than it's a shorter sales cycle. If it's a large new architecture deployment, it's going to take a little longer. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. The two products we just announced, 6000, 2000 probably more towards supporting enterprise, the carrier for the internal high-speed deployment environment. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then, just one follow-up, is there a way to gauge like where the market is in terms of its development or maybe the percentage of customers that have even deployed some form of internal segmentation? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: It's really early. I mean I think we're seeing it materialize. We talked about it a year-and-a-half or so ago and we're seeing it materialize now, but it's still early in terms of the opportunity (45:03). Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think it tends to be, from what I've seen more and where you would suspect, the verticals you would suspect it, probably first in financial services, definitely seeing some interest in healthcare as well and then even some of the telcos. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks for the color. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Your question, please. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe to start off, we've started to see some of the new CP9 appliances come out. Can you just talk about, historically, what's been the price difference between some of the new appliances with the new ASIC and the previous product families has been and whether you've seen any different dynamic with the new appliances from like a subscription attach perspective? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. This is Ken. I think we tend to \u2013 when we upgrade the system, the new generation tend to be on how our price is about the same as the old generation, but do improve in performance and the function there, that's where leverage (46:17) the new ASIC and other. That's where you can see the new 6000 and the 2000 we call the E. So that's probably the fifth or sixth generation in the system level. We stay with the same number (46:30) after FortiGate, then, it tended to be priced about the same, similar. But the new system do give us additional computing power, additional security function capability, especially like we announced the \u2013 we call the enterprise bundle security compared with the traditional UTM bundle security which added two additional new subscription service. It's the ATP subscription service, and also the mobile cloud security subscription service, so that's in the enterprise bundle that will be \u2013 each additional service, individually, will be 20%, but bundled together, probably like a 25% or 30% above the traditional UTM bundle. So that will be, long-term, driving the additional subscription service and also the additional value out of the hardware deployment. So that's where we see that the new CP9 will help in improving that performance a lot like we see the intrusion prevention side, they probably like a 3x of whether the CP or the previous processor there. At the same time, we're improving like the (47:43) performance like 14 times, 15 times faster than whether (47:49) the CP or the content processor. And the same thing for other security \u2013 additional security function put in the content processor. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And then, for my follow-up, I just wanted to hit on seasonality of billings a little bit. Obviously, very nice year-over-year billings growth of 30% and ahead of expectations. But Drew, I remember last quarter you mentioned something about maybe a little bit more seasonality from Meru. It seems like LatAm was maybe a little soft this quarter. You also had the realignment. So can you just talk about maybe what that seasonality in billings would have looked like, adjusting for Meru or adjusting for maybe some of those other items. Would have been \u2013 it sort of more in line with what we've seen kind of Q4 versus Q1? Or was there something different in the seasonality this quarter in billings? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Was there something \u2013 let me just stare at seasonality for a minute. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. So I guess specifically, billings down roughly, let's call it, $50 million or $51 million over Q4, maybe historically that's more closer to $25 million, $30 million. So I wasn't sure if that was Meru just being a lot weaker which I think you mentioned last quarter or maybe there were other items to note. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: It looks like we're down \u2013 so I'm just staring at 13% quarter-on-quarter down seasonality. We were down what 10% last year, 11% the year before. So it doesn't feel too out of range at low-teens. I think flat in America probably is the primary culprit, quite frankly. That would probably account for the difference for... Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And also.. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: ...the billings perspective that would pretty much mathematically do it. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. For the Meru, we \u2013 fully integrated team is we just went out for like a Wi-Fi security together and using FortiGate as the way to manage that. So I don't think Meru contribute much at all. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer & Company. Your question, please. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on strong quarter and improved outlook. Two questions on my end. Drew, how would you characterize linearity trends between the months of the quarter, 1Q 2016 versus 1Q 2015? Our checks indicate it to a more back to normal linearity trend versus a perceived, I think, panic buying mode we have seen a year ago. Just wanted to get your perspective on that point. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Fair question. By the way, I don't know that, again, the panic buying is probably not our terminology. And I'm not sure those two things go together. But just full disclosure, I mean Q1 2015 had much better linearity than Q1 2016. We got off probably to a better start. I think \u2013 think of it like this. First of all, you have Latin America headwind that we talked about. And then, you also have \u2013 I think the stock market might have given people a little bit of pause in January. There was a little bit of caution out there, and then, obviously, we had our sales realignment. And so, things picked up very nicely as we proceeded towards the end of the quarter. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And where do you guys stand on the Chief Marketing Officer search process given the departure a few weeks \u2013 a few months back. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: So we're searching for a global marketing head. We continue to do that. From a strategic standpoint, our strategy remains to invest in marketing. We have our plans that we're executing against. We've tripled the marketing spend over the last several years. We continue to invest there. And we think those are paying off, primarily in the area of market awareness, clearly, building a lead generation team and a process there, and then, focusing a lot on training, especially with the new sales realignment. Those two things go hand-in-hand and they seem to be going very well. So we're very committed to the marketing. We're very committed to our partners and that seems to be going very well. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Congrats. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Breza from Wunderlich Securities. Your question, please. Rob Breza - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats as well. Ken, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the new product cycle, as you think about maybe the value that's provided to the customer in terms of performance and price performance? And then maybe, Drew, just comment on how you see the product cycle benefiting the financial statements. Thanks. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Once we have a new FortiASICs or some other new technology, it's going to take some time to gradually build into the system and also have the FortiOS, the software gradually to leverage that additional computing power or the function there. So that's where we \u2013 like, we're constantly keeping improving. So if you look at \u2013 we have probably 20, 30 different models of a FortiGate. So you know that every quarter there's one, two new upgrade refresh come out. So that's where we don't see much like a big change, like from quarter-to-quarter, but we'll continue to refresh. Like, take the last two years, we refresh a lot of the high and the mid-range that we call the NP6, network processor sixth generation. So that's pretty much done. Then, we started in this cycle the content processor. We also have our other chip, we call the System-on-Chip which is more targeted low end product there. So that's where the three FortiASIC chip will help in keeping driving, refreshing the system like gradually, quarter-over-quarter. So every new things come out, we try to leverage the latest one, but we also try to, like, upgrade one generation. You only think about like a three-year timeframe to keep and upgrade. That's more like a 20 to 30 different FortiGate system. It would take some time. And also, we're starting to leverage the FortiASIC expanding into some other products, non-FortiGate like the web security, the Sandbox, in the email, some other. You see also the growth of the non-FortiGate product, we call that application security side, starting accelerating \u2013 starting to grow faster than the overall company growth, which like the super majority do come from FortiGate. So the other products are also starting to see a lot of growth whether to up-sell, cross-sell and also leverage the technology we've developed on the FortiGate side starting expanding into some other applications. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And Rob, I think Ken addressed the timing. What I would say is \u2013 what it really gives us is a tailwind of market awareness. And so, it gives us something to discuss with our customers and prospective customers where we're reinforcing the message about the Security Fabric and showing how this tethers into it to drive higher performance and innovation. And so, that's the message we're trying to drive. That's what we're doing with this. And again, there's obviously a higher performing product there, but it plays right into the strategy and the vision that we're communicating to our customers and it gives us a great opportunity to talk to them, whether it's trying to do a new installation, up-sell, cross-sell or just grab a new customer. Rob Breza - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Great. Nice quarter. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your question please. Unknown Speaker : Hey, this is (56:07) for Sterling Auty. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a small question, if we see last year, the sequential change in the operating margin was somewhere around 280 bps. But as I said for this fiscal, the sequential change from March to June quarter we see only an expansion of 140 bps. Could you please provide some color on that and how do you plan on reaching your 15% operating margin for the full fiscal year? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, so let me take the last part first, if that's okay, how do we get to 15% for the year? So obviously, you've seen some margin expansion on the service \u2013 clearly, the services line where we're executing a strategy of selling retro subscription offerings on the FortiGuard side and that translates \u2013 that manifests itself into the higher priced points we discussed a year ago. You see those basically flowing into the P&L as they amortize from deferred revenue and that drives just a more \u2013 a higher gross margin which is effectively floated down to the operating margin, that along with the higher than expected revenue. So those are obviously good things. We've guided on those. So I can't really touch any more on it. But we're very focused on managing costs and living within that envelope, 15%. We feel like we're off to a great start and we're working well together internally to execute against that target. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. Regarding the expansion of 280 bps for \u2013 if you see the expansion of 280 bps in 1Q to 2Q in 2015, was this 1Q to 2Q in 2016? It's only half of it, it's 140 bps. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, look, I think if you're \u2013 are you trying to get us to guide on the detail \u2013 I'm not sure... Unknown Speaker : Yeah, just to provide the color. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, look, I mean gross margin is product mix dependent as well. So we clearly feel like we're doing well with the recurring revenue. The price increases are clearly taking hold, but there's obviously some uncertainty and caution just around product mix which can influence the gross margin overall. So as we continue to see that uplift occur, that's something we can obviously look at going forward where we take that \u2013 where we guide on the gross margin, but I think it's a bit early yet. Unknown Speaker : And on the operating margin side? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: And so, we guided 15% for the year and we're sticking to it. We're committed to doing that. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Zeller from Needham & Company. Your question, please. Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. I knew there was a comment earlier from Ken around Meru, but we just like to get some more color. I know it's fully integrated now, but maybe the momentum of the business, if you could. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, Meru is fully integrated, Scott. And what one of the things that's occurring right now is that, it's literally in the price book, and before, we had the sales force integrated, but the price book was separate until January. So it doesn't really \u2013 you don't get kind of the factors, both teams, the incumbent Fortinet team and the legacy Meru team, selling both products. But now we're kind of that. And so, clearly, you have the opportunity to sell either one and the lines become a little blurry on it. The idea all along was, again, this Security Fabric strategy where you're going from IoT into the \u2013 end-to-end from IoT into the data center. Access is really the only security right now in the Wi-Fi layer and what we can do by selling our controllers is have an integrated platform to sell all of that. And that's kind of the strategy. It's a little broader than your question, but that's effectively the strategy. So across the board, the wireless team did fine. And we look forward to that actually doing, I think, increasingly better, as we integrate the code on the products and we're able to sell the controllers across the product line. Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And a follow-up, I saw the news that Verizon has either sold or is considering selling its data center assets, and given the historical relationship with Verizon and others, can you tell us what it means for demand for your high-end products, or low-end products, actually, when data center assets are sold off? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. We talked to our team. They don't see any impact with that spin-off. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: You have to remember, Scott, the majority of our service provider business is MSSP business. And so that doesn't necessarily get tied into a data center sell-off, right. Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC: Well, just for clarification, when a service provider uses your products for internal network use, your point is that that is not disrupted by data center sales? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: That would be disrupted by data center sales, but there's a minority of our business is just having them use it internally. And Verizon is a public MSSP customer. I can't comment whether or not they are a data center \u2013 whether they use this from a data center perspective, but as Drew said, our team feels good about minimal or no impact really based on that division. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: So we're telling there's no disruption. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your question, please. Jeremy Benatar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey guys. It's Jeremy Benatar in for Michael. I just had a question on competition in the carrier segment. So CheckPoint and Palo Alto both released high-throughput appliances recently and they're investing in the market. Just wondering if you've noticed increased competition from them or anyone else in the quarter? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: We have not seen any changing in the competitors' side yet. And also with the new 6000 and 2000, we feel we are even increasing the lead, the gap compared to competitors. Like we said in the earnings clearly, we have pretty much all the major carriers globally as the Fortinet customer and we're keeping expanding with them, especially on provide additional service to their managed security service up in this year (1:02:56). So we see it's a still huge growth opportunity, and at the same time, we have the best position. So far I'm not seeing competitor, whether from some software security company or some other network company, have the product come close to what we have. So the CP9 will help in especially driving the quarter whether the next-gen firewall or some other performance a lot at the same time, the new 6000 system also improving the performance a lot as built in (1:03:25) faster than the previous solution which we feel we're keeping leading in that space. Jeremy Benatar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. One on the long-term deferred. If I look at the growth in long-term deferred this quarter, it was far higher than your total deferred. So if I look at the mix, the mix of long-term deferred is actually much higher than what it typically is. Is there any color on that? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, we \u2013 Taz, we looked at the \u2013 I think it's a point higher, right? Yeah, it's 1% higher and it's been trending that way, and part of it is just really due to the \u2013 you're taking it off \u2013 it comes off at the old price and goes in at the new price, so there's a bit of an uplift there. Along with the fact, the way the accounting works, again, when you value the invoice for revenue recognition, you're going to weight more towards the higher price, so you end up deferring a little bit more too. And if it's a long term deal, you're deferring not only the higher price, but some multiple of that, because you carve out the number of years attached to the deal. But when we looked at tenure of the deals, we didn't see any change this quarter. So we don't believe it's that; it's not like we're hitting the billings numbers by extending deal terms. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So just to be clear, this is a function of the price increase you had last year, the increase in the long-term deferred mix? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I think that's right, yeah. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Then one follow-up. You talk about the strong growth in your cloud and virtual products. Can you tell us what the impact of that is on your revenues and gross margin? Is there an ASP impact between a physical appliance sale and a virtual appliance sale, and maybe a gross margin impact? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: It's still relatively small. I don't think we really separate that out right now. It comes from a very small base, but growing very fast. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But the ASPs, I'm assuming, would be lower for virtual appliance, and higher gross margins? Is that true directionally? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, that's true. If you're doing a product by product, so I mean a customer would need to buy more virtual licenses, several virtual licenses versus one appliance. But yeah, if you're looking at individual license, the price point, the ASP is lower and the margin's higher. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please? Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right, thanks. Just want to go back to your annual guidance. You raised the revenue outlook and your billings outlook, but you maintained your gross and operating margin targets for the year, despite the solid upside above your guidance in Q1. So I'm wondering what changed, and why we won't see that upside flowing through on the operating margin for the remainder of the year? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Andrew, fair enough. I would say nothing has really changed. I think we're being \u2013 we're really looking \u2013 as we just talked about on the gross margin side, we're looking for a more trend, a longer trend of a performance there. And then I think that's obviously something we'd consider. We've committed to the 15%. We stay committed to that. We're certainly trying to manage within that envelope. We've done well there. We hope we'll continue to do well there, but for right now, we're going to stick to 15%. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Understood. I guess, did you change any sort of spending in the back half of the year, or accelerating spending plans that may have been on the border that you weren't committed to at the time of last quarter's guidance? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, Andrew, I mean we \u2013 always spending plans are \u2013 we really kind of manage within the envelope, quite frankly. And so, we're continuing to invest some things, probably \u2013 we probably didn't end up, quite frankly, spending as much as we thought in Q1. And so, some of it turns out to a timing difference, where it just may show up later, where you may still spend something, for instance, on marketing, maybe you were going to start a program in Q1, you're not starting until Q2. And so, it's just too early to call it, I think, just three months into the year. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And the last question for me. I don't know if you gave a breakout this quarter for Meru revenue, but \u2013 or whether you're going to provide that or not going forward, but can you just tell us, was your organic growth rate excluding Meru higher or lower than the 25% you had in Q4? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, it would have been higher, yeah. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I mean the one thing is, we didn't break out Meru for \u2013 we didn't break it out for Q4, did we, Meru? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think we did. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: We did? Okay, all right. It's hard to answer the question, because you can't \u2013 we're not breaking it out for Q1. But the question is, what was our organic growth rate, was it higher or lower than Q4, right? Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I was wondering whether it trended up or down versus where it was at in Q4. You did $16 million in revenue in Meru in Q4. So just wondering what the growth rate would have looked like this quarter. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: What I could share is, again, what I would say is, just the business is blank so much it's not \u2013 (1:08:51) it's kind of hard to predict. Our wireless business is less than 7% of our total billings, if you will. The Meru piece of that might have been slightly more than half of that, something like that, when you look at the Meru products, again, I would \u2013 it's hard to consider that organic growth now, with the teams fully integrated and selling into our installed base and vice versa, it's just \u2013 I'm not sure that really applies in this case. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland from Baird. Your question, please. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Nice quarter, guys. I wanted to ask on some of the specific segments here. By my math, the high end was down a little over 20% quarter-on-quarter, and then service provider too was down over 20% quarter-on-quarter. Are those two things related? Is the high end down because SP was weak, and did the SP9 release contribute to delays there? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: The CP9? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: CP9. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: No, we just... Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. So no \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Let me just answer the first part and let them expand. So CP9, we don't even have products out yet. We just announced it, and the products will be delivered in Q2. So that was not a factor. We wouldn't categorize our service provider business as being weak during the quarter. Some quarters are stronger than others, it was exceptionally strong in Q4, and we called that out. But if you look at it, it was 22% of our \u2013 of the vertical mix, which is roughly in line of where it's been in many past quarters. It's kind of fluctuated between 22% and 26%, really, for the last two years. So it's a little bit less than it was in Q4, but we've seen this trend several times over the past two years. We wouldn't categorize it as weak. But yes, I mean, less service provider sales would also translate into less high-end products. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I guess I was just wondering if they had some advance release of CP9 product for PSD that caused... Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: No. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: (1:10:58) Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then my final question, I wanted to ask again on internal segmentation. Sometimes you hear companies in the channel, partners, talk about software-only solutions for network segmentation, SDN-based solutions from a VMware or Cisco. What does your customer base say when they consider a hardware solution versus software solution to segment up the network? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think that's where some data center security, they may use in some software to segment in some OS level and some other area. But if you look at enterprise infrastructure, that's where I'd say probably 97% of firewall deployed to secure the enterprise, which they only deploy on the Internet connection, the border side. But more inside separate departments and separate, like the important data server, so that have not been done before, and we're starting to see the trend to really deploy internally, and where you need a switch deploy. Also some data centers also have a similar approach. So the software model applied within the server level, OS level ,compared to (1:12:17) on the infrastructure. And also, you can see even the biggest cloud provider, they also, like (1:12:24) Amazon or whatever, they also say the hybrid model is the trend in the long-term. You still need to have the physical deploy in the enterprise in a user side, compared to some into the cloud side. So I see, for us, we have a both approach. We do have the cloud software version, which we see a nice growth. We mentioned in the script there and that's come from a small base, but growing pretty fast. But also the internal segmentation, which you see in the high end and also middle range products, because the middle range product we have, half of it is have the 10-gig interface, which internal segmentation mostly had to be able to deliver in the 10-gig performance. So that's where the middle and the high end were starting to fit into where the segmentation deployment will be. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen & Company. Your question, please. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. So your services revenue in the quarter was very strong for Q1, up 5% sequentially, whereas typically, you see flattish performance. And you've alluded to a few things, including more success with higher value subscription bundles and pricing changes as well. Is there anything in particular, Drew, that you would call out here as a primary driver of that strength this quarter and also, why do you think subscriptions are perhaps resonating more now, or more today, than they did previously? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. Maybe start with the last. I think start with the good news. Obviously, subscriptions are very sticky. So they do provide that recurring revenue stream. We've been focusing on it, Gregg. If you listen to the call for the last, I mean year and a half, we've certainly been calling that out as one of our objectives, a great way to stay attached to the customer. And then obviously the predictable recurring margin expanding revenue stream that comes from it is a very nice thing from an economic perspective. And so we're seeing that happening. I think we're getting very good at selling it as well as we focus on training. And so, we're optimistic that that continues. And then, just in terms of the line itself, yeah, it's really that. You're starting to see it amortize and then layers of it amortize and just kind of that compounding effect starting to come through. There's also a little bit of software in there. I talked in the past about how some software virtual licenses effectively get deferred, if they're more of the ratable nature let's say for some reason and so that shows up on the services line as well. And I think that's really the explanation there. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for that, Drew. And then just, sorry, to beat a dead horse on service provider. But one of your competitors recently issued a negative preannouncement. And in part attributed the weakness is slower carrier spend. Are you seeing any recent changes with respect to behavior from service provider? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: For our service providers, a very small part go with their internal security, but most come from the \u2013 call it managed service, the service provider offer to their customer, most enterprise customer. So that part we see as very healthy. And internally, I think it's probably \u2013 from our side, we don't see much change. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. I mean I think security still \u2013 the competitor you're talking about obviously, I mean I think it's more their networking business that they might see an impact. Security still remains a strategic investment priority for customers, so that would cover sort of the internal component. And then, as Ken said, the MSSP business which is the majority of our business with service providers is a revenue generating business for them. So very \u2013 it doesn't always usually gets tied back to OpEx expense cuts. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Your question please. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Oh, hi. Thank you for taking my question. I want to switch it over to the endpoint. You noted \u2013 during the quarter, you announced a technology partnership with Carbon Black. Can you give us any insight into this partnership? Does that impact any of the FortiClient products you have now? And then, the follow-on question is, are there other endpoint partnerships you're looking at? Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: We view to manage the security you need to be addressed the whole infrastructure, including the endpoint, so that's where the Security Fabric message. So that's the partnership you talk about is part of the whole Fabric solution, our Security Fabric solution there. But like some endpoints, especially, the new IoTs and mobile device also need to be addressed both at endpoint and also infrastructure. So they need to be working together. So that's where we're starting to see some healthy partnerships develop right now. But at the same time, you've seen the Security Fabric to really link everybody together and manage benefit together so that's the direction we're heading right now. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. And then looking at other endpoint partners like (1:17:42), et cetera, or you're sticking with Carbon Black to begin with? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: That's just starting but we do see more partnerships will be formed going forward using the Security Fabric. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: That's right. One of the key attributes of Security Fabric is openness, the ability to integrate with some of the point solutions out there at any point in the network. The value, again is the fact that we can integrate that from IoT into the data center with a common operating system. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: So openness is key. Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your question please. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Just one more follow-up on the service provider side. You called out MSS, Michelle. I'm wondering just any quantification of how large MSS is as a percentage of our service provider? And generally, do you see that business growing ahead of your overall service provider or your overall revenue? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I can't give you exactly what it was in Q1. I think in the past it's trended about 65%-ish versus 30 \u2013 65% to 70% of the service provider business is used for MSSP deployments. Again, it changes a little bit quarter to quarter. And I think it's growing \u2013 what was the second question? Is that growing faster... Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just if it's growing faster \u2013 yeah, in line faster, how it's trending versus your overall? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: I think more in line with sort of overall. I mean, the service provider business has been really steady for us through sort of the accelerated growth phase and that's really driven by the MSSP component. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just to clarify on the sales side is do you have all the sales leadership in place at this point, or are you still out recruiting? I know you're recruiting a CMO, but on the sales side, are those, call it the major regional positions, the folks below that, are they filled at this point? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Generally filled. We're still growing. I mean, keep in mind we're growing \u2013 we're still scaling the business, Walter. So we'll continue to invest. There's a couple of open positions. There're definitely some open positions to fill, but at the level you're talking about, so you may see that. But we're going to probably \u2013 you're going to continuously recruit as you grow and scale the business. And we're trying to be very focused on getting experienced sales people who are motivated and gets to the space (1:20:05). So you're very selective on who you hire \u2013 on who we hire. We want them to have a good technology background and also get the security space and understand the good book of business and be able to work with our team. But I would call it kind of both on your question. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Also on the marketing side, we have a very strong team in a position. And a few VPs, really the best in the industry whether they come from the communications side, the lead gen side, the products side and also helping driving the demand. I think the team is there. We're keeping invest more in there. But at the same time, we also keep investing and recruiting and grow in there, both internal and externally. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Walter. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto from Gabelli & Company. Your question, please. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Drew and Ken, thank you for taking my question and good afternoon. So Fortinet introduced price increases last year. Would you be able to share more insight into the penetration of the price increase among your customer base? Furthermore, how much more opportunity out there for introducing your price increase? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, it's doing well. Clearly, you could see from the growth in deferred revenue, the growth in services revenue, our focus all along, Hendi, has been build that big, that recurring predictable, margin enhancing revenue stream and it's clearly working. We started the price increases last January, but it takes \u2013 I think we told people probably it'll take 60 days to 90 days to hit the channel. And then you have to go through sell cycle which is anywhere from, I don't know, call it 45 days to somewhere beyond six months to maybe even nine months. And so clearly, what you've seen so far is taking in kind of that first year plus some of that, maybe a few renewals, but I think it's a little early yet on the renewals side and then clearly its wide open as we continue to grow and penetrate. And I think we're hopeful that the Security Fabric vision that we're articulating will help also provide an uplift for that and that's what we're training people and that's what we're marketing. And we think that fits very nicely together, the message that a common operating system, with that attached are (1:22:29) subscriptions from IoT into the data center is just a great vision and is going to resonate at the customer level. That being said, we're not \u2013 we're trying to find other opportunities. We've talked about the enterprise bundle last quarter, very early. That's just really hitting the price book. We just did that a few months ago. So, just like last year, it takes a while to wean its way into the quotes and the channel and all of that. But we continuously question ourselves on products and look at ways to enrich the offering so that we can drive that. We think that's taken, we think the economics are still there where customers are willing to pay up for more security. They're looking for consolidation. That's clearly a trend and we're looking to provide that for them and hopefully charge more for it. Okay? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And let me add some clarity there. So the price we increased is that we call it a UTM bundle, which offer four services \u2013 four subscription services, if you buy individually (1:23:32) of our price. So when we bundle together of a full service, called a UTM Bundle, we increase that price by 10% one year ago. And then early this year, we started an offer we called the new subscription service which is ATP and also the mobile cloud security service. That's starting \u2013 putting that we call the Enterprise Bundle. So the Enterprise Bundle, price-wise, is about 25% above the UTM Bundle, which bundles six services together. So that's the one we started promoting there, because customers see the additional need for the ATP and also for the mobile cloud security. So that's where we're starting to see \u2013 we're starting to ramp up this year. So that's where the pricing bundle strategy we have. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And then one more question for Ken. Ken, who do you see as your major competitors when you compete for internal segmentation firewall deals? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: You know, the internal segmentation firewall need to deploy in a very high speed environment and the internal spend tend to be 10 times to 100 times faster than the border security. That's where most of our competitors don't have that technology to address the high speed environment. And at the same time, the deployment is also different. It has to be more automatic provision instead of depending too much on fixed policy. So that also have quite a different need. So far we don't see any other competitor come close to even address this market. We see this is a huge opportunity and we're keeping investing in this area. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company: Thank you, and congrats on strong results. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your question, please. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks, and congrats on a good quarter. Most of my questions have been asked, but can you comment a little bit about the geographic mix in the Americas? Given the weakness you're seeing in Central and South America, can you give us a sense for what portion of businesses within Americas is coming from that region? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. Erik, I hate to point you to this, but I know, I believe we break it out \u2013 I believe geographic mix, at least on revenue is broken out and certainly in the K if not the Q. Yeah. So let's see. It's a significant part of our business. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I can probably \u2013 let me at least go point \u2013 we don't have the number right in front of us. So let me actually \u2013 I can email that to you, Erik. And if it's not the exact number, at least give you something to look back on within our last Q. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I would just say it was clearly a headwind and we, even in the phase of the political and economic environment there, we thought it was a bit soft. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Then secondly, can you give us a sense, for a long time the non-FortiGate products have been under 10% of revenue. Given the Fabric strategy and some of the diversification, are you seeing some opportunity to take the contribution from non-FortiGate products up from about to above 10%? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We'd love to do that. That clearly is the idea of the Security Fabric to hopefully provide a tailwind to that. That's part of the vision, to sell against that vision. We did see a nice uptick in deals this quarter where we're selling more of the product line across the board. We hope that continues. We think training's a part of that; just training our teams on how to do that and getting them away from being more focused on firewall for instance. But selling the Security Fabric vision, we think helps do that. That's clearly the idea. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rohit Chopra from Buckingham Research. Your question, please. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Drew, a question on free cash flow and then a follow-up. So free cash flow guide last quarter was $55 million... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: For the year. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I think you talked about here (1:27:50) \u2013 for the year, right, ERP and real estate. I think you did $30 million this quarter, right, in CapEx. So I just want to get a sense of the trajectory for the rest of the year, so that's the first question, if you don't mind, trying to get a sense of where we're headed? Are we still at $55 million or going down or is it higher? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Just to answer the question, it's $55 million. We're sticking to $55 million. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: There you go. Very good (1:28:11). All right. And then, the other question and maybe this is for Ken and yourself. But, what are \u2013 look, EMEA grew very fast this quarter. So I just want to get a sense of what your EMEA clients are saying about the data protection legislation? And what you're doing to maybe capitalize it on \u2013 capitalize more on that potential opportunity over there? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Clearly, it's something that we address in our training and messaging with our people. I think it's a little early \u2013 it's not coming up as a huge issue yet. I mean, with you bringing it up, honestly, quite honestly, it's the first time anybody's brought it up to us. We could certainly follow up and provide more color on that. But it's certainly something we're aware of. We try to weave in as appropriate. But I think it would be better if perhaps we did a bit of a follow up. Great question, though. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks Drew. Yeah. I appreciate it. Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome, Rohit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow-up on Taz's question regarding the long-term deferred. Did you have any exceptionally large deals in the quarter, any eight-figure deals, for example? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Eight-figure deals? I don't believe so. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No. Not in this quarter. No. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: No. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And second question, just I was hoping to understand your vision for the Security Fabric better. I've always thought that the FortiOS does a good job of integrating all of your products. And was wondering is the really incremental factor here the inclusion of APIs that allows integration with third parties? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: The FortiOS mode (1:30:00) works for the FortiGate. That's where is the center, the network, including the internal segmentation solution there. But when you cross to the like end point, the access and then the application, the cloud, IoT, then you need to have a \u2013 some different solution working together whether it's the internal Fortinet product or there's other third-party product. That's where we try to use in this a Fabric, Security Fabric approach to make it all working together. Because the biggest challenge I see a lot of enterprises facing today is too many products, whether pulling products in order to manage, how to make it working together, manage together, reduce the management costs is really the issue, because the management cost tend to be higher than the product cost. So that's where the Security Fabric try to get all wave together, linked together and also working together to address the whole IT infrastructure instead of just a point in the infrastructure side. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Michelle Spolver. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Thanks, Jonathan, and thank you everybody. The call obviously went long today. I guess that's a benefit of not having a lot of competing earnings calls today, but we had a lot of questions in the queue. We're doing another follow-up call at 3 :30, so in about a half hour. So if you want to collect more questions and call back in, we're happy to take them. But thank you very much for being on the call today. We look forward to talking to you later and through the quarter. Operator : Thank you, (1:31:44). This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fortinet Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Financial Analyst Q&A Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. However, later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Michelle Spolver, Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, everybody. Thank you for dialing back in with a shorter break than we wanted. I'm sorry that the other call ran over. I have Ken and Drew with me here and we're happy to take whatever follow-up questions we have. And I'm going to try \u2013 I'm going to prioritize here, so the three people that were in the queue that didn't get to ask questions can ask them first. But let's still try and keep the questions to one question per person, so we can at least make this call manageable. So, with that, Jonathan, you can start and take the first question. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Your question, please. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Oh, hi. Thank you very much. My question is on your small business. It looks like in billings that was a nice percentage overall. Can you provide some color between North America and Asia Pac on how well that did and what you think the outlook for that particular segment is? Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, Catharine. It's Drew. You're talking about SMB when you asked that between North America and Asia Pacific? Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Yes, yes. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: The one thing is, Catharine, is we don't break the business at SMB as a portion of the business. We do report entry level product billings \u2013 or product billings for entry level products and that did do well this quarter. We talked a little bit in the earlier call about a lot of that was due to two large deals or two large customers that had their distributed enterprise deployments that had a mix of high-end products and a lot \u2013 several thousand low-end products, so that does affect the mix. And then we're not really \u2013 we can't really project on what's happening on SMB going forward. But I think the SMB business for this quarter was pretty much in line with what we've been seeing and the uptick was really more towards \u2013 because of the larger enterprise deals with the low-end unit. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also you can see the vertical percentage at retail also pretty high and that's where the big enterprise (02:22). Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: And I think these three actually will help even further. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: So it's a little bit (02:30) SOC3 chip is coming out, a few products are coming out coming forward on the low-end which is a bit of a tailwind. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. That's the most popular; the number one selling product worldwide between all our competitors and that is the superstar of the product. Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll come back into the queue. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I apologize. You've probably gone through this so much, but I had a bunch of earnings, so I wasn't able to be on the earlier call. The number thing I'm getting in my conversation with investors is trying to triangulate, you really beat our subscription number by a lot, but it sounded like duration was up and the bookings or billings number wasn't that much bigger to help me understand why subscription beat by so much. So, I understand you talk about virtual, but are some of these virtual deals actually coming in with either monthly billings or quarterly, so it's not showing up in deferred revenue or billings or how can you help me understand the strength in subscription versus the billings number? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I wouldn't start with that explanation, Sterling. The first point I tried to make and I hate to get into an accounting conversation, but unfortunately we have to kind of go there a little bit just to understand that, one, the duration went up. And if you look at last year, Q2 2015, we had a tremendous quarter, very nice product revenue growth, and a lot of it because we sold a lot of one-year deals quite frankly. So when duration goes up, you end up exacerbating or multiplying the carve-out. So, if you do a longer term deal, when there is a carve-out from hardware to subscription or FortiCare or whatever, then you have to time it times three, four, five, whatever the duration is. And so, there was a multiplying carve-out factor, if you will, which pushes more in deferred. And I think you've been seeing kind of a shift into the longer term revenue over the last year. Again, customers are buying the way they want to buy. We're agnostic. We publish a price list. You can look at it and say, well, one, they're driving lower total cost of ownership. And so there is a price advantage when you're going to renew it anyway of doing it upfront, but anyway, it creates more of a carve-out. And I think that's really the number one thing. The other things going on is there's just more subscription content, and so as we raise prices, more of an invoice tends to end up on the deferred line, and then amortizes and ends up coming back in terms of services revenue and drives that up longer term versus shorter term. And so, you're starting to see those layers of that build and they roll off into revenue. The other piece that I think you were talking about and I would almost put that last was more kind of the virtual content. Software has more of a deferred nature to it. You favor the deferred, the undelivered elements, in terms of how you account for it over the upfront element. It's always been the case. And then we're selling more virtual, so that's a piece of that. So that rolls back into the services line as that comes off the balance sheets. And then the next piece of it is the metered model, which is a lot more than last year, but again, it's not a huge number, but that's driving it up some. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also, I would add (06:17) and also product mix also probably more favor to the subscription side, because you can look in the \u2013 I mentioned the service provider and also the retail big enterprise, and a service provider tends to buy the short-term subscription compared to the big enterprise that, the retail \u2013 the typical enterprise, they tend to buy many year long-term subscription, so that's also you can see the \u2013 because Ken also mentioned the SMB product, that mostly go to the retail branch office. They tend to commit for the multiple year model and compared to the service provider, because their customer may change year-to-year and they tend to be more committed to the short-term model. So that's where the technical carrier goes down to the 19% from the low 20% and also the retail go up and that's also kind of helping shift some of the revenue to the \u2013 from product side to the service side. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And Sterling, the last thing I would add and it sounds like you have another part of the question (07:28). Again, the Americas 15% growth doesn't help that line, right? So that's another headwind on the product line. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Right. But just following on that, so it sounds like the increased carve-out, the longer duration is a combination of what's been happening, the last couple of quarters all kind of layering in and hitting this quarter, not so much something that happened dramatically this quarter itself. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, the duration adds more carve-out. We had a lower \u2013 absolutely had a much lower revenue yield on the products that we shipped this quarter versus a year ago. That's one point. The other point is the Americas had \u2013 the 15% growth hurts that line upfront, but yeah, you're right. We've been building those layers over time and that drives it up again, but it tends to characterize a recurring revenue relationship, which we have been focused on building quite frankly from a strategic perspective. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: (08:32). Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But, Drew, the revenue yield being down, that explains the product revenue but doesn't explain the strength in subscription. I was saying the strength in subscription has to be the layering effect of what you've done the last couple of quarters all coming in and benefiting this quarter, because it looked like this quarter is more back-end loaded, so it didn't seem like it was something that happened this quarter. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sterling, one other thing that we've been doing is focusing on, our customers when they light up the project. We've been trying to get better at getting customers to register the product. And so if they register sooner, you start amortizing sooner. And if you register sooner, you also renew sooner. And so when you think of the economic value created by driving faster registration, I mean, there's another factor. And there's a lot of factors into this quite frankly, but that's another thing that's occurring, where we've been very focused on the hygiene of recurring customers are registering faster than they were in the past and that's another tailwind, if you will, to the subscriptions line. You basically start the amortizations faster. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you, guys. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your question, please. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. It seemed like there were a few mixed inputs around the traction in the enterprise this quarter, and I'm wondering if you could kind of, Drew, maybe just kind of summarize. You did mention here that you did see some strength in the retail vertical in some of those highly distributed, but you saw some weakness in the high-end product lines which sometimes ship into enterprise, although it sounds like service provider was weak and did contribute to that as well. So, I just wanted to kind of get a quick summation of what you felt like the enterprise business did this quarter? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I think it was fine internationally. Clearly, the growth internationally; EMEA grew 36%, APAC grew 37%. The businesses were just strong across the board is how I would characterize that. In the Americas, North America particularly, that's where the challenge was. What we pointed out earlier, Walter, I don't know if you were on the earlier call, but we said Brazil \u2013 specifically country wise, Brazil and Canada had a rough quarter. Then when you go into, again, those commodity-based economies, we've kind of called out before. I think Brazil has different issues beyond commodities, right? They have political issues. But anyway, those were challenged. But we're being upfront about it. We didn't see the productivity we wanted to see in North America. That's where we're very focused. And they did some enterprise business, that's where the large retail deals were. Certainly, they're focused on the enterprise, but growing 15%, it'd be hard to support an argument that they did extremely well on that side. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And on the comments you mentioned that you saw customers pushing things till the last minute trying to drive discounts and so forth, is competitively that sort of tactic working in the industry? I guess we haven't heard that several quarters ago as really price sensitivity and so forth. I'm wondering relative to customers pushing things till the last minute to try to drive discounts, do you think they're seeing that work from other vendors and that's why you're getting caught up in that as well? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I think so. I think \u2013 look, discounting is more of an incumbent defensive strategy. They're trying to stay installed and not get displaced. It clearly exposes them at risk. That's the thing. And they try to play it off of us. What I said earlier and I think we've said before, is that we generally \u2013 even though our TPO is very compelling and probably more compelling than others, we try not to just play the price card, right? You're really trying to win strategically and sell the Fabric, and if you've done that, price is already probably being factored in. You do get some grinding from time to time and they do \u2013 it does push deals to the end of the quarter and they certainly are playing off. Look, we don't always cave. We try to be thoughtful about where you do, when you do, but I'm sure we all do that some. But, yeah, I think it was a factor. It certainly was a factor in pushing things to the end of the quarter. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland from Robert Baird. Your question, please. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. This is a follow-up to an earlier conversation on the sales reorg. And Drew, I believe you said there may have been some attempt to empty pipelines in the March quarter. Is this changes that Patrice made to comp plans and quotas that may have incentive behavior? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: No, I think you just \u2013 the deals were there. I think that comment wasn't \u2013 I don't think it was \u2013 I didn't use the word attempt, I think they just closed deals that were there. They closed them there because \u2013 look, not everybody was \u2013 not everybody's accounts changed and you have some of that. And then I think you also have people picking up some deals that were in the pipeline and developed along the way, and so there was just more business closed. I think there is a newer model in place that transcended Q1 in terms of the six months or longer sales cycle. That's how I would characterize it. So some businesses happened to be there in Q1, they closed because it was developed at that point. And then I think as you rebuild some of the lead engine and kind of the handoffs and development of the \u2013 and to closing of the deals, just probably took the sales cycle, created a new sales cycle, let's say, beyond the six months, pushing it into the second half of the year. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's fair to say that the sales structure, sales teams' comp plans are in place now for the second half in the U.S.? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Oh, yeah. They were in place for the first half. But I'm just saying that they \u2013 I think those two are kind of almost non-sequitur in the sense that \u2013 look, if there were deals to close, they closed in Q1. They were just \u2013 they were there already. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rohit Chopra from Buckingham. Your question, please. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much. Hi, Drew. I just wanted to ask you a question. Jayson was asking something about pushing things to the end to get discounts. Was that globally or is that just in North America? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, globally. I think that's all around. I think... Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: That was global. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: ...I think \u2013 yeah, that's right. I think the protection of the installed base is the point. Defending the installed base. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And the question that I had was when you gave your \u2013 when you gave the outlook, you talked a little bit about caution and one of the things you mentioned was Brexit and EMEA. I just want to get a sense. Are you \u2013 we're about a month into the quarter, are you seeing specifically any challenges in EMEA or the UK specific and are you having to make price changes to adjust for a currency or anything like that or demand in that region? I think other vendors have already started to move prices. Dell was just an example, but there's a lot of people already making changes in price in the region, so.. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I don't... Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Are you seeing anything like that or any changes? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Again, our TPO is very compelling. I think we've had \u2013 we've done less on adjusting prices certainly downward, if anything, we're more focused \u2013 we're more biased on the upwards. We're very focused on making sure we're not overly compelling quite frankly, but I think we've seen in the past \u2013 which we used as a basis to raise price on the UTM bundle over a year ago and then we released the enterprise bundle this year. We're very thoughtful about trying to add more value to those as we do that. But, more directly, we haven't done anything to adjust for currency. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. My last question is just related to the competitive environment, there's \u2013 incumbents have released a ton of new products out there. And I'm just wondering has that maybe just delayed things in general? So outside of any sales force reorg issue have any evals or any FUD out there creating maybe a longer sales cycle by the incumbents with their new products. Are you hearing of anything like that from the sales force? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I think, no, what we hear more or see more \u2013 witness more, let's say, and we do \u2013 Ken and I talk to customers as well. You see more new people in organizations and I think they're thinking more strategically. There's obviously more sizes out there now, for instance, and they have a stronger role in buying behavior. They're thinking architecturally and strategically. I think that's the type of thing that probably puts some more pause in the system than anything. Then, I think the other factor is that, a lot of money has been spent on security over the last year. They have all these products. I think they're thinking about how should one consolidate and then also how do they get a more affordable wallet over time, let's say, right? So I'm sure that CFOs around the world are very focused on ensuring that the budgets are appropriate for the long-term models of the company and so they probably get a little pressure on that side. Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate it, Drew. Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael H. Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Mike Feldman for Tal. Just one on AccelOps, so could you talk a little bit about the competitive technology differentiation between the FortiSIEM and some of the leaders in the market like a Splunk or a LogRhythm? And then from a go-to-market standpoint, when do you expect your channels to be fully educated on the solution and selling it in the marketplace? Thanks. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, this is Ken. I think we try to well manage security-related SIEM, that's where the AccelOps product what we renamed the FortiSIEM will be working together with other Fortinet products there. Especially, we have the biggest deployment globally, probably more than double the number two and that will help in lower the management cost, at the same time, the AccelOps product also help us to go to multiple vendor management together like there are some other networks and some other storage, and the channels we use in the FortiSIEM product to get visibility and drive what we call the Forti Fabric strategy better. So that's the piece we don't quite have before and this will help enhance all this. And the other part, really, we can have a more actionable and through any like the intrusion, any incident response working with FortiGuard, that's where any like a break-in or whatever we can quickly do the analysis and also respond to the break-in. Michael H. Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Okay, and then when do you expect to have the channel partners fully ramped up on the product and in the market selling it? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: There is two strategy. One, really keeping enhanced shipment of the current product with the FortiGate side. That's probably what we're already studying to go to the field. And the other part we're launching we call the FortiCare 360. So that's the part we're helping the current customer to manage their deployment better, so that probably will be in the early Q4. So, we're leveraged the AccelOps FortiSIEM product to launch service. And so that's a service on top of the 8x5, which had bought 15% of the hour per year and also 24x7 which had about 25% of the hour price. This will be probably about 35% and we're still in the evaluation beta testing stage, but the formal launch probably will be early Q4. Michael H. Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Gorham from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, yes. I just want to follow up on the question before on AccelOps. Drew, I think you said there was a $4 million contribution to deferred revenue from AccelOps this quarter. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So if you're calculating organic billings, then it makes sense to take out that $4 million in deferred revenue. And then in terms of what you have embedded in the guidance moving forward for AccelOps, can you maybe give us an idea of what we should expect from an inorganic perspective? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: And so, I think \u2013 Melissa, let me make sure I heard you correctly. I think you're basically asking did we adjust out the $4 million in billing. Is that the first question? Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. No, I just wanted to confirm it was $4 million, and then just in terms of your guidance for the full year, are you assuming any inorganic contribution from AccelOps either to the top line or in terms of expenses? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: So, the $4 million is correct on the addition and you could see the math, it's not inorganic, but it's not in the billings. It gets renewed. So, the second piece was very little contribution. First of all, it's a subscription model. And I think just any time near term, it's near-term disruptive, especially, when you're trying to drive synergies in the business. We're more focused on getting it into the bundle. Again, we'll sell it separately as an offering, but I wouldn't expect much there. It's certainly very little. Even though it comes over, there is some duration in their deferred revenue as well. So it's not like that's all going to roll off in the next six months, if you will a little bit. But we don't expect much topline of a tailwind from that business. So, on the op margin side or the expense side, if we do nothing, they were \u2013 it actually contributed probably $1 million of OpEx \u2013 uncovered OpEx in June. So, you could extrapolate that forward to kind of get a sense for how that might impact the year if we don't do anything. But we're very focused, as I said, and putting that in the mix of our model, again, their primarily a Western Hemisphere entity, probably mostly North America, and we're looking at that and driving the synergies across that business. Again, just the easy way to think about it, from our perspective, it's all about productivity. How do we ensure that if we have people in place, whether it's AccelOps people or Fortinet people that they're driving the appropriate level \u2013 appropriate return on the investment. And if it makes sense for us then we keep it, if not, then we deal with it. There are some R&D folks and they will stay, but they will offset that other hiring that we would've done and it's almost as though, because we're talking a little bit about \u2013 the people are asking us about how much can you really tamp down on hiring. But think of AccelOps as really forward hiring on the R&D side, so we're offsetting some of something that we would've just done anyway sooner. So you're in a way front-loading people you would've hired, but then what we're really trying to do is make sure we do get that benefit and offset it. And Ken and I are very focused on who's being offset, what's being offset, and trying to drive that down so that it has a minimal, if any, impact on op margin. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the like of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your question, please. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in here again. Maybe just to stay on that topic of AccelOps there, Drew, and just talk about general expenses in Q2 to Q3, so, first, how much, realizing AccelOps is small, roughly how much does AccelOps kind of contribute or did it contribute in total expenses in Q2? And then kind of secondarily, did you see an elevated level of discretionary spending, whether it's marketing campaigns or T&E or whatever the case may be something non-hiring that could be brought back easily? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Good question. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Because, the question I think that we're all getting, right, is the sequential change in expenses, it's kind of flat to down compared to \u2013 historically, we've kind of seen it being sort of up, and so while know that hiring service is obviously the biggest lever, I'm wondering how much of the acquisition as well as the discretionary pieces may play into that compare. So any commentary there would be really helpful. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's a great question. I'll say what I said and you can tell me if you want more on AccelOps, but it was about $1 million negative in June for cost up, that's about $1 million on the OpEx line. And so I think I answered the rest of how we were dealing with that going forward. The other things that hit us were commissions and so, again, where you have these larger deals, the duration, you're paying the full commissions on these. So, you have people getting into accelerators, you get some skew of the business in terms of several large deals they can \u2013 they hit us. And I think our competitors see this from time to time too. There is something there, and we're very focused on that one as well. There's opportunity there let's say. We're also looking at things we do, and we talked about synergies in AccelOps, and synergies is a broader conversation because although there are AccelOps, we've talked about offsetting, hiring that we would have done anyway, we're also talking about sales productivity and making sure that we don't have any overlaps, Ken even mentioned overlays, those types of things. You want to make sure you have the right model in place, we're looking at deal margins, contribution margins, we're getting more and more focused on those types of things, which not only drive productivity, but they \u2013 we may take out costs or not spend more on those areas. And again head count would be one of those. The other one is even just like marketing, and so as you build things you find that some things are working better than others, and so \u2013 or you're doing something twice, maybe you're doing something in Europe that you don't need \u2013 you're doing in the U.S. too and you may find some synergies there. And that's where we're also focused on a few things. There's other areas like you would find in other any company you can, there are some controllable expenses. I could get into things like T&E, and \u2013 just the other things that are out there that we're very focused on. Just to make sure that if we need enhanced control, let's say or enhanced scrutiny that we're going to do that. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure, sure, but seems like, I guess maybe the new thing or is the thing that I probably missed from the last call was commissions, maybe it seems like it was a little bit higher than what we were expecting and that maybe... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...managed a little bit more in the back half. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. We'd certainly focus that \u2013 I think I'd probably didn't say the word commissions. I was probably enveloping it in the concept of productivity, but it's in there. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a bunch. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please. Andrew M. Boyce - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is Andrew on for Andy here. I guess, coming back to the sales incentive side of things, are you guys looking at implementing any programs or are there any changes you guys can make to your incentive structure to improve linearity? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, we actually do have a linearity feature in the commission plans. I do think part of it is just the \u2013 the fact , you know the sale cycles, you know you have new people, new organization. I think the sales cycle has just made that hard to do. I do also think there's some buying behavior that we've talked about. Where our customers are holding deals to get a better deal, whether you call their boss or not, it doesn't prevent them from doing that. So even that is certainly in the mix. But, yeah, we're looking at that, but I mean, that's not an unusual issue. I think we were probably better than most companies linearity wise a year ago. And then I just think just more recently is where it's become more backend loaded. Andrew M. Boyce - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, I see it. Go ahead Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: I was going to say we've seen that through with a number of companies that have reported already in terms linear earnings. While we didn't, I think that the uncertainty in the environment that you talked about in the main call, probably had something to do with it. Andrew M. Boyce - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: If you think about Brexit, we were asked a lot about, did we get affected, anything that in future performance affected by Brexit, I mean, it didn't from deal standpoint, but it probably did in delaying some purchasing, it \u2013 those deals came in, but I think there is probably some caution on customers, and again I think it's more, hopefully you get back to better linearity, we have sort of incentives in place, which we have had in place to help that. But at the end of the day, I think it's more being driven by customers. Andrew M. Boyce - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Definitely, that's fair. If I can just sneak one more in here, I guess given the free cash flow in this, are you guys comfortable with where the street is at, I know, you won't provide guidance for that number specifically, but any commentary you can provide, I guess, to what do you think free cash flow might \u2013 where it might stand at Q3 would help? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, so again, fair question, and surprised somebody hasn't asked that yet, but the \u2013 we don't guide on free cash flow, we do talk about CapEx though, and we've had some opportunities, look we've been talking about real estate for a while, we're basically out of space here in our Sunnyvale headquarters, and there are some offices in where we pay leases that have come up as opportunities for us to buy. We were actually going to guide up on the CapEx slide, I think we were at $55 million for the year, we're now going to say that we're going to give ourselves some room to buy some real estate, and that could go up to probably $80 million or $90 million for the year. When we look at these properties, they're either adjacent properties or properties we're in, and there's very compelling reasons to do it, again we have the cash to do it. The payback on these is usually seven years or so. We may not do it, but it's amazing in the last month that a couple of properties that one we're in, and another one that's adjacent have come up for sale, and we've been talking to those people for quite a while, and they just happen to come up now. They would have come up next year or the following year anyway, but we're going to give ourselves some room, so \u2013 we do get the price, then we'll move forward on that. Andrew M. Boyce - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Definitely, that's all I had. I appreciate it. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have a couple of questions. Drew how much was the duration in Q2 of last year? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Give me one second. 21... Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: 21 months Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: 21 months Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And this quarter you said was 22 months to 24 months, I'm sorry. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: 23 months, 23 months. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then, one question on the sales reorg. I know you guys did just reorg in North America in Q1, when was the similar sales reorg done in EMEA, was it done in the same time or was it done in the prior quarter and...? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: They were done together, but I \u2013 we've been stronger internationally to be frank. I think those have been more add to the current model and the leaders probably expanded their responsibility, capped some of their responsibility and expanded it. In Americas, we had a change \u2013 in North America, we had a change in leadership along with Patrice becoming the global, running it globally. And, so Patrice still runs Europe right, but the North America piece is new to him, for instance, and then he brought a leader over from Europe to North America, who was extremely successful \u2013 the most successful of our leaders in Europe and from a large company \u2013 global company, and so that was the idea there, so it's more new, it's certainly there's more newness to the model that we have, North America really. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And the linearity was backend loaded, it was just in the U.S. or was it all across all the regions? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I probably believe more so in North America. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: We did see it around ..... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes, it was around the globe but I would say probably more so in North America. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then, one last one, I mean you mentioned about the increased duration resulting in high carve out of subscription revenues, but I'm still not clear why would that impact product revenues negatively because you don't defer product revenues, right, regardless of the duration you don't have spot revenues in the quarter? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You carve out more to the subscriptions. The way the accounting worked is, you basically balance the invoice based on a benchmark of what the price should be, and then if you \u2013 duration, if there is a carve out, if it's a one-year deal, you only do 1x of the carve out. If there's a three-year deal, you do 3x. If it's a five-year deal, you do 5x. And so, it exacerbates, multiplies if I could call it a better word the accounting carve out, and then it gets pushed into subscription revenue because what you're trying to do is balance the undelivered element with the upfront of the delivered element, a product of the delivered element. And so, the accounting will favor the undelivered element historically, and hardware is a little different than software, but you still have this kind of relative ratio carve out thing without getting into the accounting conversation, but I think the point is it more applies to carve out when that exists. And we did see, look I could check that. We checked that by looking at the top deals, and we could see that the revenue \u2013 upfront revenue yield was much lower than a year ago, and we attribute that to the carve out and the multiplication factor, yeah, the duration factor. Imtiaz Koujalgi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. That's all for me. Thank you very much. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your question please. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. It's Fatima on for Brent. Thanks fr taking the question. Drew, I just did a double-click on kind of this product use subscription and in carve out, and revenue deferral mechanics that you are more pronouncedly experiencing. Is it fair to say that you're having significantly more traction in selling bundled versus individual subscriptions and that's one of the reasons why you're seeing a bigger carve out. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I am trying to think of the mechanics of that, I think that's right. Yeah, that's right because first it's kind of just firewalls a year ago, maybe you're seeing more bundles certainly, right. And I think customers are buying more strategically or qualitatively if that makes sense. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : And so are you incenting your sales organization to encourage customers to buy the UTM bundle or the enterprise bundle as opposed to paying 20% of the list price for one singular functionality. Is that the right way to think about that underlying dynamic? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We don't compensate on that way, we don't trade on that way, because obviously if you want to drive. We want to drive the recurring revenue stream, higher margin it's recurring obviously predictability. You know all those reasons you'd want a recurring revenue stream. And so we're certainly favoring the trading, as you could look at our pricing is obviously been biased that way as well, and we'll continue to do that. Again, we really see enterprise \u2013 UTM bundle year-and-a-half ago, enterprise bundle more recently, and then we talked about FortiCare 360 bundle including the cell locks technology coming out probably in Q4 (37:22) Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Understood. But the appliance itself is still your primary security functionality delivery vehicle, right? I mean at the end of the day... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: It is, but there's more... Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : You still have to sell appliance. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. It is, but there is more software and there is more \u2013 the metered model is moving a little bit. There's just more other things. There is more breadth of selling, we talked about growth across the product line. We are focused on the fabric. The idea there is to get deployed, land and expand. The breadth of the product is the best way really to attach yourself to the customer longer term, and expand longer term, and again drive those recurring revenues. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : That's really helpful and maybe flipping the question around a little bit, you did talk about non-FortiGate billings up in excess of 50% or substantially better than the overall business. I'm wondering if you can give us the sense of what proportion of your, call it entire subscription services family of offerings is unattached versus attached to an appliance sale? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I think most are probably attached. There can be some follow on, but most are attached, I think is the way to think about it. Now AccelOps, again, we're going to try to wrap -- we're going to wrap it into the bundle, but it's \u2013 currently it's a separate product albeit pretty small. That is a subscription product that would standalone right now, but I think that's the only \u2013 I guess you could buy some of the other ones as a subscription. Whether you did it, you bought through AWS for instance. That would be one way or some of those service provider offerings. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Just to be clear, FortiWeb and FortiMail, and your FortiAP offering, it would have to be associated with an appliance purchase or do you have to be a pre-existing Fortinet customer to be able to enjoy the kind of the security fabric benefits from those offerings? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Whether like FortiMail, FortiWeb, I forgot the other one you said, FortiSandbox, they have specific \u2013 there will be a \u2013 let's say, you buy FortiSandbox, and you probably wouldn't buy the bundle, you should buy our APT service to go with that FortiSandbox similar to FortiMail you can probably buy the email security and subscription service. But the vast majority of customers who buy FortiGate will buy the bundle, because they'll use it for a lot of different \u2013 they'll be able to get the benefits of the integrated threat protections through the bundles. Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Understood. That's it for me. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP. Your question, please. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yes, thanks. First off, I want to be clear, did you say that duration last year was about 21 months, and it was also 21 months in the first quarter. So it's been flat. And then this quarter, it saw a pick up to 23 months, is that the right chronology? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Secondly, you added about 300 head count in the \u2013 over 300 in Q2, and you're looking for a decline on the OpEx flat to down and OpEx in Q3. Would you be surprised, if head count is actually down by the end of Q3? Is that something that's possible? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I probably wouldn't want to guide on head count. But just keep in mind, that I think, 65 to 70 came over through AccelOps. And so that's a way to think about it \u2013 I think, our model is matured, we're very focused on managing the head count. Could it be flat? I think that's a possibility. I wouldn't guide one way or the other. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. And then did you say CapEx this year will be $70 million to $80 million, is that what you said? Unknown Speaker : $80 million to $90 million. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : $80 million to $90 million? And... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We're guiding upside, again it depends on the timing (41:35). So we haven't closed any of these deals. What I said is that we're in one building that came up for sale, and then some adjacent properties have come up for sale in the Sunnyvale headquarters. For any of you who've been here been here you know, you could probably see we're out of space. And it makes sense to buy those. We haven't done those. The price has to be right. But there is a chance we'll do those, and we would have done those eventually. I would put it out there and we tend to look at a payback model \u2013 certainly under \u2013 I think I used the word around seven years, but certainly under eight years or nine years, something like that. These are just things we would have done. You're effectively accelerating spend on those things if that happens \u2013 if those do happen. But I have to guide up just because one literally came to us yesterday. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. But you are suggesting that analysts factor the $80 million to $90 million into their models for 2016. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I am, I am. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : And is that somewhat of an anomaly in light of these two transactions in which case calendar 2017 presumably wouldn't be at that level? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I haven't guided for it on 2017 but clearly we're \u2013 these are things we would have had in the long-term model that we were going to do over time, we were trying to do over time. Our key is to get them at the right price. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Lastly, education had a nice pick up in the quarter. I'm sure that's partly because of seasonal strengths but even on a year-over-year basis, it was pretty strong. Was there anything unique to education in the June quarter that would explain why it was strong even year-over-year. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: No, I mean we called out in the commentary a couple of deals that were with larger universities, but it wasn't anything that we did, that means \u2013 we won the deal, but we didn't do anything as a company to a make a bigger focus on education. I think to your point, it tends to be a bigger year seasonality in terms of volume, but then we also got a few big deals, bigger deals that were universities, and they were more international. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Was that more international, is that correct? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Pretty much, I mean it's both but the ones we called out in the script were international, but I think we probably got universities around the world, but there wasn't anything, I don't think there's anything to really dig so much in there other than it's just sort of a mix of customers that made up this quarter and we did pretty well in education. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : It wasn't a function of E-Rate funding or anything unusual from the federal side, was it? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: No, these ones were more traditional next generation firewall, datacenter firewall, there wasn't internal segmentation firewall deals, it wasn't associated with E-Rate. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Universities, not grade schools. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. A lot of discussion on the overall macroenvironment and how the buying patterns may have changed year-over-year, just curious when you look at your internal business from the win rates that you are seeing when you compete, if you're seeing any change in the win rate? Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: No. <: I mean, I don't think we are seeing a change in the win rate. We are still \u2013 our win rate is still very strong, we've always sort of said that it's even increasing and we can go in and test against competitors, and we do extremely well, and I think that hasn't changed in terms of win rates. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: If you look at even market share gains and we're growing well above two times the market but clearly we're continuing to gain share and win over competitors. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen & Company. Your question please. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. First I just had a clarification on wireless and I know of course you wouldn't explicitly breakout Meru, but in Q1 you would say that wireless was about 7% total billings of which Meru was maybe a little bit more than half. Does that change one way or another this quarter, I wasn't quite clear on that? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Wireless \u2013 wireless is a little better than 7% and this quarter I think we're still under, yeah, about 7%. So, I don't see any big change there, Gregg. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just getting back to service provider falling below 20% of billing. So, I think Drew this is the first time that that's occurred in the company's history at least as a public company. Do you think that goes back above 20% in the second half? Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I know you asked Drew, but either one of us can answer it. Gregg, it's Michelle. I mean it is abnormal because we usually are seeing it \u2013 the range is usually above is above like 21% and 25% So, I do think this quarter was \u2013 the reason why it fell below was because of the deals that we talked about, so I don't know if you're asking to expect those deals to come in. As we said, the deals didn't get lost, they didn't go to a competitor. Our hope is that they do come in, I think we probably will get to more normalized level. And I think we are changing with the service provider environment and right now we're not saying any types of change in that environment. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Benatar from Raymond James. Your question please. Jeremy Benatar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: No, my question was answered. Thanks, guys. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your question please. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of clarification points on your deals. Do you always collect cash up front? And also along those lines, do you either regularly or occasionally defer the comp associated with multi-year deals? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We could yeah, I mean we collect within normal terms I mean that I think you need up front basically within under, does that not paid like year later or something like, the answer is yes. We \u2013 then \u2013 we defer the comp the only time, no I don't believe with the further comp. So if the deal is recognized, if we call it deal billing or we call it a deal where we pay the comp, and then it's not smooth, if that's what you're asking. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah and the cost....? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Deferred and then amortized. We don't amortize commissions we don't defer them, we are \u2013 we're still taking them as we basically, as the deal happens and we accrue it, and we'll pay it out in the next pay cycle, and they get paid in July basically, Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Okay and so along these lines, I think at one point you've actually disclosed services and other billings I think up until 3Q of last year if I'm not mistaken. I was curious, one is that on the uptrend, and then as you \u2013 given all the commentary, I'd assume that services will become a larger part of your business going forward, and are you waiting for guidance on the upcoming changes to revenue recognition to perhaps making a decision around that? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We were waiting \u2013 we've been hearing everybody's been getting (49:07) question. The -- well let me \u2013 let me take in two parts. We don't really guide on the mix. I mean I'd be more biased on the services line. Obviously, the accounting that I talked about basically forced that to happen, again as we focused \u2013 we are delivered \u2013 absent the accounting, and what I \u2013 hopefully we've been very clear on for quite a while now is we're very focused on growing recurring revenue streams. And those tend to be articulated in a subscription, and so that's the focus, we charge more for them. We have more content, and then we charge more. Again with the added sell offs to the bundle we call it \u2013 it's a FortiCare 360 bundle \u2013 FortiGuard 360 bundle that'll hopefully come out in Q4, be richer, be a higher price product. We had the enterprise bundle come out recently. We saw some of that in Q2. And again that favors the line. And then the accounting does the same thing because when it gets deferred it tends to come back on the services line. Now shifting forward into the revenue recognition change we're talking about almost year-and-a-half out now right, if it happens. That we don't see a big change there yet, again not to get too far into an accounting conversation, but my understanding is that if you're under the (50:37) standard that it basically is similar. We're on a sell-in model too, which I think it kind of forces you \u2013 it points more to that because it's going to just deliver the elements concept \u2013 our performance units concept and delivers a unit of performance, so I wouldn't formally guide or say that but I think that's our reaction right now. That's our kneejerk valuation, and we've talked about it with our auditors as well, and that's generally where we think we are. Could be some change, we obviously have to go through it, but right now we don't think it'd be material, we will let you know if that changes. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. . And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks. Michelle Spolver - Fortinet, Inc.: Now, I can actually close the call. I'd say thank you all for the time that you spent today in our first call and second call. Hopefully, we were able to answer about most if not all the questions. And I will be around if you have further questions, and let's say, we are also going to be doing some conferences this quarter, so we'll be out seeing you on the road as well. And thanks a lot. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

And thanks to everyone joining today's call to discuss our third-quarter 2016 results. Fortinet delivered year over year building growth of 16% and a revenue growth of 22% despite a more moderate global micro [indiscernible] than we saw last year. On the short for our original guidance, we continue to get market share and win important customers. Additionally, we keep our focus on expense management for improved profitability and towards our goal of 20% operating margin in 2020. As we showed a few weeks ago, the contribution factor that will lead to the shortfall were both macro and execution related. From a macro standpoint, some of the issue seems to be secular and some transitional. We continue to see a more moderate spending environment globally and this affects our performance in all three regions. We believe customers are in a digestion phase following two years of elite purchases. Additionally, as we ponder closely with a large enterprise and service provider customer to plan their next generation to secure architectures we have learned they are increasingly being more strategic in their purchases, extending purchase decisions of buying only for what they immediately need. And finally, macro-economic challenges of Brexit in the UK as well is ongoing geopolitical issues in Latin America were also contributors. We also faced execution challenges in those markets that further impact our performance. The full benefit of the sales force realignment commission earlier than this year have taken longer than expected to achieve, primarily as a result of hire newness within the organization. Many sales reps are still ramping and the productivity in North America is less than we would like. We are laser focused on resolving execution issues and remain highly confident in our competitive advantage and our long term opportunity. I continue to hear from customers that Fortinet has the best technology to meet their current and future security needs. We have a strong advantage here over all competitors and are well-positioned to benefit over the long-term from security consolidation and the cloud trend. We are working very closely with our partners and customers and having success in both of these areas. Sales of cloud-related products and services continue to grow faster than the other products and are being deployed in public, private and the most hybrid cloud. We are securing public cloud for SMBs so strong partnership with Microsoft Azure and AWS where customers are purchasing a FortiGig, FortiWeb, FortiMail, FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer on a pay-as-you-go model and our security fabric also extends to secure enterprises, private cloud, EM and your own licensed model in a virtualized software. Cloud adoption also represents a market expense opportunity for us to leverage a strong technology advantage high success and seven sounded system to traditional service provider and extend that to cloud providers. Later this quarter we will deliver a new Fortinet 76 inch chassis based system, the most powerful addition to our product line and the gear to meet the highest performance requirement of Tenneco and the cloud service providers. And to integrate our CP9 security processor as well as significant advance in our design system performance and scalability to deliver the highest next-generation security performance in the industry. On the consolidation front our ability to provide a similar to partially integrate an intelligent security fabric that protects all points in the network, sets Fortinet apart from competitors and positions us well for the future. Competitors talk about a full platform but only Fortinet can deliver true fabric that spent Cline, network, application and cloud along with secured access. Last Friday's massive Internet denial of service attack highlighted the need for multiple layered and a type of security. Without protection internal segmentation firewalls and secure access of Internet connectivity wise were needed here and Fortinet offers all of these solutions. And with the security market remains healthy, and Fortinet is the key in the industry of consolidation and the cloud trend. We are one of the few vendors continues to outgrow the texture within the network security market and our focus on results in our execution issue in those markets. We have a strong technology advantage and a recently roadmap in place to help us continue to grow our market position and address our large opportunity. Looking ahead we will keep innovating in technologies which help power and enhance our security fabric and enable customers to implement cloud and next-generation security strategies capable of delivering seamless, comprehensive threat protection across ever-expanding attack surface. I will now turn the call to Drew to review our financial results for Q3 2016 and forward guidance. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. Let me share our financial results for the third quarter, which can be seen on slide 3. As Ken mentioned, Fortinet's billings increased 16% year over year to $347 million. Total revenue of $317 million was up 22% year over year. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $935 million up 32% year over year. This is a trend that has become more pronounced as our mix of business shifts to enterprise and we have more margin-rich recurring subscription and service revenue. We continued to deliver a strong non-GAAP gross margin of 75% which exceeded our guidance range of 73% to 74%. This reflects our focus on driving sales of higher value, higher price and higher-margin recurring revenue streams such as services and virtualized product offerings. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share were 15% and $0.18 respectively both at the high end of our original guidance ranges. We remain focused on driving profitability and are on course towards our previously stated longer-term goal of 20% non-GAAP operating margins exiting 2020. We managed expenses well, and if not for the billings shortfall would've delivered substantial progress toward that goal this quarter. Finally, we generated $70 million of free cash flow during the quarter despite our billings and revenue shortfall. With respect to our third quarter topline performance, as Ken discussed, both market and execution issues were at work. We believe we are well positioned competitively in the market and our laser focused on improving the things we believe we can control such as our own execution and ramping the productivity of our sales and marketing investments. We have an aggressive plan in place to address the execution issues in North America which includes -- enhanced and increased enterprise-specific marketing in areas such as digital marketing and lead generation to drive quality leads and better sales productivity. We plan to reallocate marketing budgets, not meaningfully increase them. We're also working to improve sales onboarding, training and enablement. We're focused on ramping salespeople more quickly and training them to sell them broader Fortinet security fabric and enterprise bundles. That should help drive larger deals and improve sales productivity. We're also implementing a more frequent and disciplined review of sales force productivity and pipeline conversion, with a drive toward more balanced linearity to reduce the amount of business that needs to be closed in the final weeks of the quarter. And finally, our plan also includes forging and deepening partnerships with key systems integrators and enterprise solution providers to sell our end to end fabric in large enterprises. Fortinet has the best technology in the market and technology that the market wants. We've made the investment and have the salespeople in place. We are laser focused on making them more productive. Increasing sales productivity should benefit both top line and serve as a key contributor to long-term operating margin expansion. Let me provide some context on how we plan to drive sales force productivity and non-GAAP operating margin expansion to our target of 20% exiting 2020. First, we believe revenue and margin improvement will be driven by improved productivity of our North American sales team. With more than 40% of these people, these sales reps with less than one year, we have yet to realize their full potential. As mentioned on previous calls, we have been realigning our sales teams to be more strategically focused on the enterprise space which we believe has a longer sales cycle. However, our pipeline is growing, which provides us with optimism going forward. We believe we will have a more efficient and effective model in place for future growth as we focus our sales teams more directly on defined enterprise customers. Also, we are in the process of bringing best practices to North America around focus, marketing, lead generation, and training I mentioned earlier. These are currently effective in our higher-achieving international regions. In addition to these improvements, we believe the continued shift to higher margin services bundles such as our newly released FortiGuard enterprise bundle and FortiCare 360 support services, will provide a beneficial tailwind to margins over time. The shift in our customer base to larger enterprise can also provide a tailwind to margins. These customers often purchase more over time and have higher lifetime values. It costs less to maintain and up sell an existing customer than it does to acquire one. Finally we continue to sell more virtual products, which have higher margins than physical projects. As Ken mentioned, Fortinet's strong technology advantage enables us to benefit from key secular trends such as security vendor consolidation and the move to the cloud. These are powerful tailwinds for Fortinet for many years to come and also substantially expand our market opportunity. Fortinet security fabric weaves together our market leading products, advanced services and partnerships to provide seamless protection in all points in the network. From end point to data center to cloud in virtual, physical and hybrid environments. This is a strategic and important consideration for our customers as they move from the limited capabilities of point products and away from incumbents lacking the necessary innovation or integration capabilities that are Fortinet's hallmark. We expect this consolidation trend to continue as a business driver for Fortinet and to drive multiproduct deals in the future. As evidenced in Q3 2016, sales of non-FortiGate product lines grew significantly higher year over year than our overall growth rate, with the highest growth coming from FortiSandbox ADP products. We also saw more deals that included multiple Fortinet products in both physical and virtual or cloud environments. Reflective wins in the quarter included landing a large healthcare provider with expansive operations in both North and South America. This organization wished to replace model aging security solutions with an advanced end to end security platform. In a competitive bake-off, Fortinet was chosen for our ability to provide an expansive tightly integrated fabric. This deal included numerous FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiATP and FortiAnalyzer products along with our FortiGuard enterprise security subscription bundle. We're having early success with our cloud solutions which represent a significant expansion opportunity and long-term driver of our growth. Fortinet delivers security to the cloud and for the cloud. We support all major cloud deployment scenarios whether public or private. This provides customers the ability to choose and migrate where and when they need. We partner with AWS, Azure, Google and others who offer a variety of deployment choices, a common operating system and a management platform across IOT to cloud. We have a strong competitive position in the early days with cloud adoption and are winning deals and partnering with customers as they architect their next generation infrastructures. For example, during the third quarter we won a global AWS cloud migration deal with the Fortune 500 travel company. This hybrid cloud deal included the combination of our virtual FortiGate and FortiManager solutions along with numerous FortiGate hardware appliances. We were chosen for our ability to offer single pane of glass management and increased control capabilities with a unified operating system. This is a global project with first deployments commencing in the United States. Our base of customers continues to grow and in Q3 we added 9,000 new customers, bringing our total to approximately 290,000 customers worldwide. We also continued to see growth in the number of large deals across deal size categories. Deals over $100,000 grew 27%, deals over $250,000 grew 12% and deals over $500,000 grew 16%. Growth in large deals during the quarter primarily reflected a tough comparison versus Q3 of 2015 and the impact of the macro and execution issues we discussed. Our breakdown of billings across our top site verticals with service provider at 21%, government at 14%, financial services at 12%, education at 11% and retail at 8%. Now let me turn to the geographic breakdown of billings for Q3. Americas billings grew 16%, EMEA billings grew 16% APAC billings also grew 16%. In addition to the macro issues we discussed all three regions faced tough comparisons of a record 41% billings growth in Q3 of 2015. We saw the same market trends of longer sales cycles and more strategic buying behavior across all regions. The Americas growth rate of 16% also reflects the aforementioned sales execution issues and softness in Brazil as well as a tough year-over-year comparison of 36% Q3 2015. EMEA grew 16% year over year although we anticipated a tough year-over-year comparison of 50% growth in Q3 2015 and the potential impacts of Brexit and macro uncertainty in our plan, these factors recently proved more challenging. Finally, APAC grew 16% against a tougher 36% year over year comparison in Q3 of 2015. Now turning to billings by product segment on Slide 4, we continued to see diversity of FortiGate product billings across all segments with the high end accounting for 37% of total product billings, our mid-range enterprise products accounting for 29% and our entry-level products, for 34%. Total revenue was $317 million in the quarter, up 22% year over year. Revenue performance was driven by the combination of 7% year over year product revenue growth and 34% year over year services revenue growth. We saw a continuation of the revenue mix shift trend we and others have seen this year, in which services are outpacing product growth. Aside from tough year-over-year comparisons, this reflects our success in selling higher-priced subscription bundles and virtual products. On a geographic basis, you can see on slides 5 and 6 that revenue continues to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. In the Americas revenue grew 18% to $134 million. EMEA revenue grew 27% to $117 million and APAC revenue grew 19% to $66 million. Moving to non-GAAP expenses and profitability. During the quarter our non-GAAP gross profit margin was 75%, above our original guidance of 73% to 74%, primarily due to more higher-margin services revenue. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 83%, in line with last year. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 62%, down 180 basis points from the third quarter of last year, partially due to higher inventory reserves. Non-GAAP gross margin was again positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as our VM line of virtualized security solutions for cloud and virtual deployments and the impact of our price increases on our subscription bundles. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $190 million during the third quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $46 million or 15% of total revenue. This was above a revised guidance range at the low end of our original guidance. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $32 million or EPS of $0.18 per share which was at the high-end of our original guidance range based on approximately 178 million diluted shares outstanding. The annualized non-GAAP tax rate for 2016 decreased to 33% as we become relatively more profitable abroad. As seen on slide 8, we ended Q3 with a strong balance sheet including $1.271 billion in cash and investments. Our $70 million of free cash flow included $6 million in capital expenditures. Similar to Q2, our free cash flow was impacted by a shift in linearity where more of our business occurred in the third month of the quarter versus Q3 2015 resulting in a higher ending accounts receivable balance. Annualized inventory turns for Q3 were 1.7, below our annualized goal of 2 or a better, as a result of billings falling short of expectations. Deferred revenue increased to $935 million, up $228 million or 32% year over year and $31 million sequentially. Finally, during the third quarter, Fortinet repurchased $25 million of our common stock in the third quarter at an average price of $36.04. That's noted in our press release on October 11. Fortinet's board approved an additional $100 million of authorization for share repurchases, increasing our current authorization to $300 million for repurchases through December of 2017. As of September 30th, we have purchased a total of $75 million of our common stock under our authorized $300 million share repurchase program, leaving $225 million available. Now let me finish with our guidance for the fourth quarter 2016. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements including all of the guidance statements provided are subject to Michelle's cautions at the start of this call. Fortinet's market opportunity and competitive advantage is significant. Our investments have helped lay the foundation for our future growth and share gains, increasing profitability and cash flow as we execute on our plan to increase productivity and improve sales execution in the coming quarters. We're well positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds such as security product consolidation and the move to the cloud with our end to end security fabric. However, our third quarter performance and what we're seeing and the market has given us some pause. We expect North American sales execution issues to take a few quarters to fully resolve and sales productivity to ramp over time as the sales force matures and we execute on our improvement plan. In addition, the markets moved toward vendor consolidation and next-generation cloud architectures could continue to elongate sales cycles. Although these trends ultimately benefit Fortinet as one of the few vendors with the technology, products and performance to capture those opportunities, they could continue to impact growth for the near term. In addition, we see political and economic uncertainty around the globe and continue to face comparisons, tough comparisons versus our outperformance last year. It is prudent for us to carefully factor all of this into our forward outlook. During Q4 we expect billings to be in the range of $424 million to $432 million, up approximately 12% year over year at the midpoint. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $341 million to $347 million up 16% year over year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 74%, non-GAAP operating margins expected to be in the range of 15% to 16%. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.21 based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 178 million to 180 million fully diluted shares. This brings our full-year 2016 guidance to full-year 2016 billings in the range of $1.476 billion to $1.484 billion, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.254 billion to $1.260 billion, up 25% year over year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 74%. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 13% to 13.5%. Finally, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.64 per share to $0.65 per share based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 176 million to 177 million fully diluted shares. In closing, I would like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that, Ken, Michelle and I will now take your questions. Operator you may start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ugam Kamat : This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. Can you talk about any sales execution issues? Could you throw some color on where those sales execution issues actually existed, like were those service providers, were those large enterprises? Any color on that would be helpful? Ken Xie : We have issued realignment earlier this year and we also hired a sales team. Like right now we have, U.S. probably 40% of the sales team has been less than a year on board and at the same time, we also tried to build in a market engine to drive the sales. Like the lead gen, and the branding and the digital marketing and also the match each program. So all of this still needs time to ramp up and that will contribute to the shortfall that we have. I think we are in a much better position compared to one year ago without the marketing machine BDR and also the teams on board and we just need some time to keep improving and keeping execute. Michelle Spolver : The one thing to clarify is a question I think also asked about what sectors contributed more to the shortfall. It was both. It was probably primarily enterprise, however there were some deals that did not close in Q3 that were service provider deals and you can look at sort of the breakdown of our vertical mix. The service provider came in at 21% which is less than normal. So it was really those two sectors. Ugam Kamat : Just a follow-up. Michelle Spolver : You can't do a follow-up. Sorry, we can't. We need to keep the call short. We have a second call you can call back into. Sorry about that. Ugam Kamat : No problem. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Gabriela Borges : Thank you for taking my question. You have been talking about the changes of macro and the sales force as being factors in guidance for a couple of quarters now? Just curious for 4Q whether there's any change in the way you are thinking about forecasting the internal business? And if you're handicapping these factors to a greater degree than prior quarters? And then more broadly speaking, do you think that 12% growth in billings marks a low water mark? Or could we see further slowdown from here? Thank you. Drew Del Matto : Gabriela, I believe there was several questions there. I want to make sure that I get them. I think the first question was, have we, do we feel like we have addressed the risk from the macro issues we were talking about? And I think the second piece in the second question was are we at the low water mark? Is that right? Gabriela Borges : Yes. That's right. Drew Del Matto : Fair enough. They are similar answers, I think. I think we are from a forecasting perspective we're very consistent on how we forecast. We want to address those issues and we believe we have taken those into account in our guidance and we certainly, we have certainly talked to the team and we have done a lot of research with them looking at it top down, bottom up, and you know trying to look at it as many ways as we can and making sure like we feel like we have addressed the issues. What we're really waiting to see I think is productivity improve. I think once we are hopeful that once our sales team has some time in place and when they mature. They are now more focused on the enterprise for instance, and I think once they are given the opportunity to be successful in their new accounts, when you think about all of the new people on board, then that's when we would expect ultimately to see things turn around, so to speak. I think until we have those signs, until we have actual signs, I think we want to make sure that we are taking the other factors into account with guidance. Gabriela Borges : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is now open. Saket Kalia : Just want to talk about the CP9 ASIC? Can you just talk about how much the appliance slate has been refreshed with CP9 and whether we think any of the pause this quarter maybe could have come from customers waiting for that refresh to happen? I guess more broadly, the question is -- any talk about the CP9 refresh affecting this quarter or the coming quarters would be helpful? Thanks. Ken Xie : This is Ken. I don't believe the CP9 has a big impact for the quarter. CP9 does have a huge improvement over CP8, and also we're just not in refresh from the high-end. Like when we introduce the 7000 series and we had a new model come out later this quarter, it is relatively new market and really the best performing, the most powerful machine in the industry address the big service provider and also call provider. But that is still in the early stage. We have not done anything in the other rings yet. That is to come later in the quarter. I think we always keep we now call it a security processor, whether it's a processor or chip processor -- and then every quarter we announce a couple of new products thus improving change from all of the 16 years is they smoothly introduce the product and lavish the latest technology, so if you have the CP9 still in the earliest ramp up stage and it does impact the heaviness. Saket Kalia : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Gorham with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Melissa Gorham : I wanted to follow up on the commentary on the service provider business? I think last quarter it was relatively weak and I think the takeaway that it was maybe Company-specific versus something that was probably felt throughout the industry? Is that still the case? And I'm just wondering if you have additional color on what is driving the weakness? And then thinking about guidance, are you assuming that the softness continue? Ken Xie : This is Ken. I think the service provider --we still feel -- like I said, they're compared to like the last two years they have elevated purchase and now they are more strategic, trying to see what would be the long-term future direction. But also we see a quick ramp up that we call the cloud service provider starting to offer security in the cloud. They are also facing some similar challenge like the traditional service provider on how to secure the cloud and how to secure the pipe and how to secure the data. A lot of it is actually in the hybrid mode. It will impact the service provider and enterprise makes a decision, like which application will fit in the cloud, which application do you fit in there on the own datacenter. So I think that is where the service provider will plan in at the same time with the new cloud provider with some other enterprise making their decision about the future cloud trend. That I feel has some impact off the decision and also we do involve a lot of planning with them but I feel, compared to last year, this year some of the decisions take longer compared to one year ago. Drew Del Matto : Melissa we've taken into account -- you know we have obviously had detailed conversations with our carrier team and we believe we've properly taken it into account for Q4. Ken Xie : Also we have the best position in the care service provider competitor. We have a huge advantage on the portal side. On the service on the south model in the cloud, so we believe we are well positioned for the future growth once they finalize their decision or the strategic planning. Melissa Gorham : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Obviously you have lower margins now with the pre-announcement and the guided into 4Q? Can you talk a little bit about your philosophy and your thought process with the margin expansion now, and delinearity towards getting to that 20%? How are you adjusting that and what can we begin to expect in terms of investments into next year? Drew Del Matto : Michael I think first start there are two answers to that. One, I think what question you're asking about is how do we get to 20%? Is that the first part of the question? And the second part is what are we thinking about in terms of investment? Michael Turits : Right. Obviously revenue is different than you are expecting? Are you adjusting in order to stay in that linear path? Drew Del Matto : Fair enough. Look, I mean okay, sorry. If you step back and you think what drives the 20%. I will start with that and then I will look at 60 and then talk a little bit about the investment. If you think about the leverage for operating margin obviously productivity is key. That's what we are banking on. We've made some investments. As the sales force matures and is hopefully successful, then that is a way to drive the install base. And obviously, margin expansion comes from expanding with an account versus landing, and it's more expensive. We also have some gross margin benefit which we have seen which is really due to the mix shift more towards the services line for all this reasons we talked about. And then there are generally some other efficiencies we could probably grab which could be spending initiatives. When we look at 2016 we've made adjustments to the team in August when we brought in XL ops to basically cover that off in terms of the dilution that would've been there. And we went to a more direct approach in sales with less carriers. And so we feel like we have make those adjustments. For Q4 we are probably not doing a lot, quite honestly, in North America. People, there's always some turnover and some people coming and going. So there's always some of that, and so without being too exact there may be a little bit of investment here and there and maybe some people leave you may not replace them. On balance I don't see a lot of investment there. Really, until we see things turn around. Internationally, we see pockets of growth and we continue to invest. We've reflected all of that in Q4 guidance. And going forward without guiding for next year, or getting into next year, hopefully what we would love to see is a productivity turnaround. Which should really be the tailwind you are looking for along with the mix shift of the services line to drive and expand the margin. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : It's Jim on for Walter here. Based on what I am looking at here it would seem as though, it's like you should be seeing the sales force mature? And you just kind of answered Michael on the last question? When should we expect the sales force to actually mature to levels that you can start getting that leverage? Does it become a Q1, Q2 even back half of next year issue? Or it\u2019s even as though that sales force should be more mature at this stage given the past hiring? Drew Del Matto : Fair question, Michael. What we're seeing is sales people who have been in their seat a couple of years are producing like somebody who has been in the seat for a year. And that's kind of the average. Two years ago they would ramp faster. But I think the market has changed and from what we are hearing from others we think the market has changed. And we talk about these macro shifts or these macro changes, where there is the consolidation theme, where customers are looking to consolidate on a platform or for other reasons to get end-to-end to get better pricing or whatever it is -- that's there. I think customers clearly are in a digestion phase, and we probably benefited that productivity-wise a few years ago in the past. And then they are also looking at NextGen architectures and pausing. Not necessarily going to the cloud yet. We don't see tons of that. We do see a mix shift of business showing up on the services line that probably -- it's new business that would've shown up on the product line in the past. And it shows up on the services line so it gets deferred. Which pressures margins early on because you're not getting that forward upfront revenue piece. And those are really the factors. So when we look forward we want to see signs of those -- you know, one, our success in growing the productivity as either customers begin back to what we believe are more aggressive buying behavior that would benefit us. Take into account also that we have remapped to more direct coverage. And it takes a while to develop those enterprise relationships. However, the consequence of that, you get deeper into that enterprise once you get in you have the opportunity to expand especially if they look to consolidate on a given vendor. And so we are hopeful that those are things that will help us. The other thing and -- within our control we also talked about enabling our sales team with more tools and things like solution guides and stuff like step selling. More lead gen and onboarding them more quickly with training and things like that we believe would help. But there are things that are out of our control which are the other themes we talked about, consolidation, digestion, NextGen architectures. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Drew I think many of us are hearing about the shift from perimeter to internal segmentation and end point? I'm just curious if that is what you are seeing in your pipeline? And if so do you feel your sales reps are keeping pace there as it relates to the win rates against some of the best of breed vendors that are going after each of those spaces? Drew Del Matto : We do not believe our win rates have changed, Brent. We do not feel like we are losing deals. We just feel, what we're seeing is elongated sales cycles. The deals do not really go away if we look back to Q3 in Q2 we feel pretty good about it. And we've done some deep dives with the teams and they seem to be doing the right things in the right way to get there. But what you were talking about is we have not seen that impact our business. The one thing I would say to the extent that people look at NextGen architectures, and you look at a broader blend of technology than what you mentioned, that may be more impactful. Ken Xie : Also I do think in the internal ramp up quickly, but also we called the security fabric. We are into the internal segmentation you need to bring the whole infrastructure. So that's where we see the non-FortiGate part ramp up quicker than FortiGate. So that does all connect together through our security fabric but that is also some additional training to the sales team. That will take more knowledge and maybe a longer time for them to understand how to sell beyond the FortiGate that might combine this together as a total solution from ATP, e-mail, Wi-Fi access to the switch to the management. Even today, early today, we announced we [indiscernible] so that's additional service on top of the traditional 24x7 customer support. It is actually for the customer to do the health check and do the deployment and if they have some issue may be the customer is even not aware of so we can bring this ahead. That is the part where they have the training both for the sales and the engineer and also to the partner. That will also take a little more time. I think security fabric is the best solution for the industry and we have much broader solution than any other competitor but also take a little more time for the team to really catch up on this new solution. Michelle Spolver : The security fabric extends to the cloud. The products that Ken was going through, most of them are available virtual and physical. In the cloud business, as Drew said in his remarks, or Ken, it's actually one of the fastest, or was the fastest growing part of our business, the sales of the virtual offerings and the products that are available with AWS and Azure. There is a beneficial impact from the cloud. I think the non-beneficial impact could be something like Drew is saying is that it extends the sales cycles. As customers are planning their next-generation networks, perhaps shifting some to the cloud in the hybrid model and it does slow things down in the decision making process but we feel from a competitive standpoint we are very well positioned. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, Gray Powell : You have increased prices a couple times on the subscription side since early 2015? Have those price increases fully worked their way into the install base? And as a follow-up, co you see potential for further price increases or the ability to introduce more expensive bundles? Drew Del Matto : Gray, Drew. I think there is probably a little bit left of the price increase coming but I would not expect much out of that going forward. You know we're not quite two years into it but certainly 18 months at least into it. So if you get the channel some time to absorb the price increases we're about 18 months into it and that is most of the way through. There is probably some opportunities on renewals. The one thing I would like to point out is we did announce the enterprise bundle which is a higher priced bundle in the past. We have seen some traction there which is a good sign. And so it would be more/less about the price increase and really, the story about enriching the bundles and charging more for the value-added through that, that includes the ATP solution and mobile security. And if you look at FortiCare 360 which we now this morning, that's another opportunity again where there is more functionality and value there that we are going to charge more for. But that is early stage and it would probably be more to follow on that. Would not expect a lot of out of it in the near term, but I think it is the right idea. And again part of our strategy is to really take advantage of the consolidation theme and this was one way to do it, and also protect our customers at the same time. Clearly if that is more valuable to them then that is something we feel can charge more for. Ken Xie : This is Ken. Actually we see price increases but also the new service we offer like an enterprise bond we offer the ATP service and also the cloud mobile security. So that is it two service the customer needs the most in an enterprise environment. We start to do service three or four months ago and rep are, we have 10% and we do believe customers see the huge value of ADP and the mobile security so it is a huge opportunity going forward. Gray Powell : Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson Noland : I wanted to ask more on and S&P shift to the public cloud? Some of your peers have seen this part of the market accelerate to public cloud and it looks like your entry-level business was soft quarter on quarter by my math? Are you seeing this trend also? And can you talk a little bit more, Drew about how the economics differ in the public cloud sale versus an appliance sale? Thank you. Michelle Spolver : Let me take the first part and Drew can talk about the economics, Jayson. So if you look at the SMB, the business that would account for from the SMB standpoint would be business we're doing through the metered model with -- like in AWS and Azure. And as we mentioned before, that was one of the fastest growing parts of our business. It is doing well, its small. Its small for everybody right now, but it is -- we are seeing some very nice growth there. That would not be shown. You would not be able to see that other than the AWS business but yet I think it is doing as expected and doing well. Drew Del Matto : Yes and Jayson, I think for mix quarter to quarter it is hard for us to say that is a trend. It really just depends on how many distributed enterprise deals you did, perhaps. Or how much of that is going to be -- there is more in there and so as Michelle said we don't feel like we have been impaired on the SMB side. When you think about the economics, you know, obviously a lower price point you know up front, but as you extend the pay-as-you-go over time or the metered model over time, it surpasses the unit economics of a perpetual appliance or even a software perpetual license. So the breakeven point is somewhere north of the guidance. That takes time and it's a very high adhesion rate on that when you think about the fabric stretching end to end. Something the customers want and it is also higher-margin. When you think about our P&L, you translate that into our P&L, it is still such a small number. We do not feel like it's been that much of a drag on the top line, yet we don't really see that happening for the near-term. But what we think is, given about the way we are growing we think it is actually good news in terms of ultimately both growth and margin because again it is pay-as-you-go, its recurring model, its obviously higher-margin business that takes advantage of a given infrastructure so we think it is a good business to be in. It is something that is coming, probably SMB does come before enterprise obviously large enterprise. We haven't seen it yet but we feel like we could manage it into a model and be a tailwind ultimately to margin expansion and probably even market share. Ken Xie : Just to point on the technical side. Some of the SMB application moved to the cloud helps in some of the branch office solutions because when you move that data to the cloud you need a secure access to that data so you need a clean pipe. You also need a bigger, faster bandwidth to access the application in the cloud. So that is actually helping and you can see three years ago, we remember when most of the employed solution was based on accuracy data and now we are number two competitor. So we keep the increase in especially if it's a new introduction of the ISO three which has a 10 time performance functioning improvement so we feel like we have a stronger position in the SMB solution there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is John on for Erik. You have talked about bolstering the lead gen and branding to improve the business in North American enterprise? I was under the impression you have had kind of an elevated level of investment in that area over the last year or two? My question is what will you be doing differently to drive productivity and growth in North America? And also does the additional investment in lead gen and branding require incremental spending or is it just a shift in spending? Drew Del Matto : Sure, and John I will take the last question first. It is a reallocation in our mind. It's a reallocation. We are taking a very close look at where we feel we are getting the best return on our investment. And where we also feel we are trying to identify where we need to shift those investments. And trying to basically really get better productivity out of the dollars invested on the marketing side. When we think about it, and you think about productivity, there is a component of on boarding that we think is part of the answer. And the things there would be training and, you could be, we hire a lot of great people. I feel like we have a great team but they may be coming from another company and so there is a way that Fortinet sells and selling the fabric involves the complexity, especially given the things we talked about consolidation and NextGen architectures and digestion phase. It's a little different selling motion than two years ago. So we are really trying to arm people with how to sell into the enterprise, given those macro conditions and then also how to sell our products and sell the fabric. And again that takes a little longer. Along with that we want to do is make their job easier. We feel like our branding is much better than it was a year or two years ago. Most people know who we are now. We still get some of that but generally speaking, customers know who we are. They may know less about what exactly we do or how we can add value so we are pointing more marketing around specifically around that in the hope of driving improved lead generation to make it easier for our sales reps to sell and getting them to the right place in the Company to sell. Other things we are doing is just giving them more tools and solution guides and step-by-step competitive selling motions and making sure that those are appropriate given the conditions we talked about today. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal : Maybe on the heels of the final and most recent question, where do you stand on filling the position of Chief Marketing Officer? Ken Xie : This is Ken. We are still aggressively looking but at the same time we also like to say we're keeping in vast and improving the current marketing engine structure there and the digital marketing and digital engine. So we have like 40 or 50 people on board and we have a 150 leads and at the same time also on the poll outside from channel marketing so we're looking at the same time but building the structure ourselves right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open. Jonathan Ho : I just wanted to go back to the consolidation of spending? Are you starting to see customers that you are dealing with do more bundled purchases across your product line? And sort of unifying and standardizing on the Fortinet fabric as opposed to the other way around where maybe you are trying to defend against some consolidation? Michelle Spolver : Jonathan it is Michelle. We are seeing that. As Ken talked about, the sales of non-FortiGate products significantly outgrew our overall business and we talked about one of the deals that he highlighted had a multitude of Fortinet products and obviously that was one of several deals that was done. So we are seeing that we do see the consolidation trend favoring Fortinet. We have a very broad offering with our fabric. It's what customers want. They are not buying everything today but they're actually buying more from us. And that is one of the things that we are getting in terms of helping productivity. To continue to train our sales force better to sell the broader Fortinet fabric because the trend is actually going on in the space with large enterprise customers we are having some success. Drew Del Matto : Jonathan I mentioned in my part of the call, my script part, about a fortune 500 travel company which is a hybrid cloud deal that included a combination of virtual FortiGate and FortiManager solutions along hardware appliances. And so really that illustrates the power of the fabric and it involved a cloud migration deal and so it has all of the above. And I think it illustrates the strategic approach customers are taking, again hybrid model -- both virtual and hardware and extending across a variety of products. Ken Xie : Also [indiscernible] just gave the product solution and that's the reason we launched the FortiCare 360. So that is proactively supporting and fund and identify the deployment issue and also gives them a better easy to manage some of the security solutions we have. Jonathan Ho : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Imtiaz Koujalgi with Deutsche Bank. You line is now open. Imtiaz Koujalgi : I have a question about the guidance, so Drew if I look at the midpoint of the revenue guide and you assume a normal seasonality for the maintenance growth, I get park revenues going down or flat year over year and it's never happened before? Are you being extremely conservative or is it based on what you are seeing in your pipeline today? Drew Del Matto : Taz, look, obviously, we have taken an ounce or two of caution given the dependency on the products. When you think about the product revenue a lot of it is dependent upon the larger deals. Obviously, we had a challenging quarter in Q3. And for all the reasons we mentioned, the macro conditions and what we talked about productivity/execution. Brexit, LATAM, we want to make sure that we have a chance to see those things turn around in some way or some condition to see some blend of those before we go too far out on that front. And so we feel like we are reflecting that in our guidance. Clearly we would like to see larger deals, more larger deals. And those are some of the things. The only the other thing I would point out, Taz, is there is clearly a mix shift going on. And I just talked about a blended product where they are buying virtual products. There's some metered business, there's new business. When you think about product I think a lot of people think about that as being new. It's an indication of the future. Some of that new business is showing up on the services line. I think this is what we and others are seeing and it is several hundred basis points. At least 200 to 300 basis points of mix shift we're seeing into the services line that is showing up on the services line. So there's a few things we are trying to see normalize and you know I think we are reflecting that in the guidance. Operator : This does conclude our Q&A session and I would like to turn the call back over to Michelle Spolver for closing remarks. Michelle Spolver : I know there were a few of you in the queue that didn't get to the questions. We do have another call, reminder, at 3.30 p.m. File feel free to call back then everybody and we will do the best to take the rest of your questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

With that, let me now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thank you, Kelly. And thanks to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. In the fourth quarter, Fortinet delivered a billing revenue growth that exceeded our guidance range. We benefited from our focused effort to improve sales productivity and expense management and are well on track. So, we have more work to do, but are pleased with the progress we have made and with the performance in the fourth quarter. As customers move forward to consolidation and a seamless tightly integrated approach to security, we\u2019re seeing a sharp increase in the adoption of Fortinet Security Fabric architecture. Our ability to provide a broad, powerful, and automated Security Fabric that protects all points in the network, from IoT to cloud, physical and virtual networks, wired and wireless environment set Fortinet apart. Our competitors multiple-point products and platform solutions simply are not capable of providing the broad solution, processing performance and the advance automation necessary to address the demand of today\u2019s digital economy. As we continue learn and expand into some of the largest enterprise corporations and the government organizations in the world, we added more than 10,000 new customers during the quarter. This brings a total to more than 300,000 customers worldwide. Boarder adoption of our Security Fabric also results in increased of sales of enterprise security services and of numerous [ph] FortiGate solutions. The Internet of Things and cloud computing are key technology drivers of the digital economy. Every day, over 1 million new IoT devices are being connected to the internet. The recent massive IoT based DDoS attack showed how vulnerable this device can be. Keeping up with IoT requires internet based network security. Internet based network security automatically translates in its requirement into synchronized network security actions without human intervention; Fortinet has laid the foundation for the internet based network security with its Security Fabric architecture. Our strong technology advantages also uniquely positions us for effectively deliver security to the cloud and for the cloud. We\u2019re securing public cloud through strong partnership with Microsoft Azure and AWS. Sales of our cloud related products and services across public, private and hybrid cloud continue to grow faster than other part of our business. Today, we announced expansion of our high-end FortiGate enterprise firewall for service provider and enterprise customers. The FortiGate 7060E and 3980E. The FortiGate 7060E is the world\u2019s fastest next generation of firewall and most powerful addition to our product line. And integrate our new CP9 security processor with significant advance in hardware design, system performance and stability to deliver high security performance in the industry. The FortiGate 3980E is the world\u2019s first terabit per second network security appliance. It is ideal for enterprises that need very high network throughput and a deep inspection delivered in a compact appliance. The FortiGate product also been approved by the Defense Department\u2019s top service security authority as a solution for classified network, validating that Fortinet delivers the performance and scale that [indiscernible] need for complete security assurance solution. Finally, we just returned from a Worldwide Sales and Global Partner Conference with more than 2,000 attendees. The enthusiasm among employee, partner, customer has never been stronger. With our Security Fabric, we deliver broad, powerful and automatic security solutions spanning end point, access, network, application and cloud. We\u2019re one of the few network security vendors that continue to outpace the market. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll continue to innovate and invest to further differentiate and provide our customer with a comprehensive threat protection they need today and for the future. I would now turn the call to Drew to review our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results and forward guidance. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. Let me now share our financial results for the fourth quarter, which can be seen on slide three. Fortinet had a strong end to 2016 with billings, revenue, margins, and non-GAAP earnings, all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges. Fortinet\u2019s billings increased 22% year-over-year to $463 million. Total revenue of $363 million was also up 22% year-over-year. The outperformance in top line growth was driven by seasonal demand, improvements in sales productivity, and success in selling multiple product deployments, demonstrating adoption of the Fortinet\u2019s Security Fabric architecture. Deferred revenue increased to $1.35 billion, up 31% year-over-year. The growth trend in deferred revenue has become more pronounced as our mix of business shifts to more margin-rich recurring subscription and service revenue. Sales of enterprise bundles nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, which drives recurring, higher margin revenue over time, and increases customer lifetime value. We delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin of 76%, exceeding our guidance of 74%. Our focus on driving sales of higher value, higher price and higher margin recurring revenue streams such as services and virtualized product offerings, helped improve gross margins in the quarter. From a profitability perspective, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share were 22% and $0.30, respectively. These are both well above the high end of our guidance ranges. Organizational discipline combined with improvements in sales achievement contributed to the operating leverage we delivered in the quarter. Our continued focus on expense management and sales productivity will keep us on course to reach our previously stated goal of 20% non-GAAP operating margins on an annual basis, exiting 2020. Finally, we generated $84 million of free cash flow during the quarter, an increase of 40% over the fourth quarter of 2015. While we\u2019re pleased with our fourth quarter results, we recognize that we have more work to do to make our investments in sales and marketing fully productive. And we remain focused on continuing to execute our plans. Further, we continue to keep a close eye on expenses to ensure operational efficiency is an ongoing driver of profitability. In addition to these improvements, we believe margins will benefit from the continued shift to services, cloud and virtual solutions such as FortiSIEM. As Ken mentioned, Fortinet\u2019s strong technology advantage enables us to benefit from key secular trends such as security vendor consolidation, segmentation, IoT and the move to the cloud which necessitates increased level of visibility and security orchestration. Fortinet Security Fabric weaves together our market-leading product, advanced services and partnerships to provide seamless protection, industry-leading performance and excellent visibility and security orchestration at all points in the network from IoT and more traditional end points to data center, to cloud in virtual, physical and hybrid environments. This is a strategic and important consideration for our customers as they move from the limited capabilities of point products and away from incumbent, lacking the necessary innovation or integration capabilities that are Fortinet\u2019s hallmark. We expect this consolidation trend to continue as a business driver for Fortinet and to drive multiproduct deals as customers adopt the Fortinet Security Fabric to protect their entire infrastructure. This adoption of the Fortinet Security Fabric is driving more business as evidenced in Q4 2016 by sales of non-FortiGate products. Growth in these product lines significantly outpaced our FortiGate products with significant growth coming from FortiSandbox ATP products. We also saw more deals that included multiple Fortinet products in physical, virtual and cloud environments. As an example, of this type of multiproduct integrated adoption of the fabric, in the fourth quarter, a large financial services company signed a contract to expand its Fortinet deployment. Having rolled out Fortinet solutions at all of its branch locations, this customer purchased the mixture of FortiGate 3200D, 1500D, and 600D bundles in the fourth quarter to replace an existing vendor in their data center. This also included FortiManager VM, FortiAnalyzer VM and enterprise services. Also in the fourth quarter, a large government ministry in the Middle East chose Fortinet to replace their entire existing solution with one integrated platform. In a competitive bake-off, Fortinet was chosen for our ability to provide an expansive tightly integrated fabric and displaced at least four existing vendor. This deal included numerous FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiATP and FortiClient products along with our enterprise subscription bundle. Additionally, a leading university in Europe with an extensive partner in campus networks chose Fortinet to provide a fully managed UTM service. As Ken said, our cloud solutions are a critical component of the Fortinet Security Fabric and represent a significant expansion opportunity and long term driver of our growth. Fortinet delivers security to the cloud and for the cloud. We support all major cloud deployment scenarios whether public or private. This provides customers the ability to choose and migrate where and when they need. We partnered with Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and others to offer variety of deployment choices, a common operating system and the management platform across IoT to cloud. The flexibility and performance of the Fortinet Security Fabric and the visibility and security orchestration advantages that it provides, put us in a strong competitive position in the early days of cloud adoption. And we\u2019re winning deals and partnering with customers as they architect their next generation infrastructures. Our cloud and virtual business more than doubled year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Although, this was from a small base, it continues to represent the fastest growing segment of our total business. This segment of the business will provide yet another high margin recurring revenue stream that contributes to future business growth, predictability and profitability. Some example of key cloud deployments and expansion in the fourth quarter including a contract with a large UK government agency to deploy FortiGate in a high availability design. This is part of a government initiative to migrate a majority of on-premise functions to the AWS cloud. The deal expanded upon prior Fortinet virtual machine and AWS with an on-demand model. In another example of cloud deployment, Fortinet signed a deal with a large global cable company to deploy FortiGate in a high availability design. Rolling this out to notable, global AWS market. In both of these deals, the customer chose Fortinet based on performance, flexibility and the ability to deploy a hybrid model architecture. We saw a substantial increase in large deals in the quarter across all categories, driven by improved sales execution in enterprises as well as an increase in Fortinet Security Fabric deals. These are generally larger, multiproduct deals and now include higher price, enterprise subscriptions and services bundles. Deals over $100,000 grew 27%; deals over $250,000 grew 24%; and deals over $500,000 grew 31%. We had a record 39 deals over $1 million, which represents 39% growth over the same period in 2015. Our breakdown of billings across our top five verticals was service provider at 22%, government at 18%, financial services at 12%, retail at 8% and education at 7%. Now, let me turn to the geographic breakdown of billings for Q4. Americas billings grew 19%; EMEA billings grew 24%; and APAC billings grew 22%. Enterprise sales in North America rebounded meaningfully from prior quarters, and sales executions improved. EMEA also benefited from improved sales execution and strengthen in enterprise and Security Fabric sales led by strong performance in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. APAC benefited from strong performance in Japan and Southeast Asia. Now, turning to billings by product segment on slide four. High end products accounted for 41% of total product billings; our mid-range products accounting for 29% and entry-level products, accounted for 30%. Total revenue was $363 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. As you could see on slide five, revenue performance was driven by the combination of 10% year-over-year product revenue growth and 34% year-over-year services revenue growth. This shift to higher service growth, reflects our ongoing success in driving higher price subscription bundle, metered model business and virtual solutions. On a geographic basis, you can see on slides six and seven that revenue continues to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. In the Americas, revenue grew 23% to $150 million, EMEA revenue grew 22% to $140 million, and APAC revenue grew 22% to $72 million. Moving to non-GAAP expenses and profitability. During the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin was 76%, above our guidance of 74%. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 84%. Non-GAAP product gross margin improved to 65%. Non-GAAP gross margin was again positively impacted by higher sales of software such as our security solutions for cloud and virtual deployment. The growth in higher priced services such as enterprise bundles, product mix and the benefit of lower overhead and warrant costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $195 million during the fourth quarter, resulting in a non-GAAP operating income of $81 million or 22% of total revenue. The upside was driven by our ongoing focus and discipline in driving operational efficiencies. Expenses in all categories were down sequentially as a percent of revenue. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $53 million or $0.30 per share, which was $0.09 above our guidance range based on approximately 177 million diluted shares outstanding. The annualized non-GAAP tax rate for 2016 remained 33%. As seen on slides eight and nine, we ended Q4 with the strong balance sheet, including $1.311 billion in cash and investments. Free cash flow in the quarter was $84 million. Annualized inventory turns for Q4 were 1.8; deferred revenue increased to $1.35 billion, up $244 million or 31% year-over-year. DSO was 78 days, one day lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Finally, during the fourth quarter, Fortinet repurchased $36 million of our common stock at an average price of $30.92. For the full year of 2016, we repurchased a total of $111 million of our common stock at an average price of $28.76. $189 million remain available for share repurchases through December 31, 2017 under our currently authorized $300 million share repurchase program. Now, let me briefly discuss full year 2016 results, a summary of which you can find on slide 10. Total revenue in 2016 was $1.275 billion, representing growth of 26% over fiscal 2015. Annual gross margin was 75% compared to 73% in 2015. Annual operating margin was 15% compared to 13% in 2015 and consistent with our guidance at the beginning of 2016. On a diluted basis, non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.73 in 2016 compared to $0.51 in 2015. Cash flow from operations was $346 million. Free cash flow was $279 million. Before I discuss guidance for the first quarter and 2017, I want to provide some detail around our future real estate intentions. As I have mentioned in past discussions, Fortinet anticipates expansion requirements over the next several years both at headquarters in California as well as in Vancouver. In both of these locations, we are opportunistically expanding our footprint in a controlled and staged approach. We expect that these moves will be accretive over the long term. Including the cost of real estate and other items, we anticipate CapEx of approximately 140 million to $150 million in 2017. Roughly $15 million to $20 million of this number was pushed forward from last year, when we estimated $80 million to $90 million in CapEx, but only used $67 million. Cash flow from operations combined with ongoing improvements and balance sheet efficiency should continue to produce strong free cash flow. Now, let me finish with our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2017. As seen on slide 11, as a remainder, all forward-looking statements including all of the guidance statements provided are subject to Kelly\u2019s caution at the start of this call. Fortinet\u2019s market opportunity and competitive advantage is significant. Our investments have helped lay the foundation for our future growth, share gains and increasing profitability. With our model layer, end-to-end Security Fabric, Fortinet is well-positioned to benefit from industry trends such as security vendor consolidation, internal segmentation, IoT and the move to the cloud. Although these industry trends will ultimately benefit Fortinet, we believe they could continue to elongate sales cycle. Additionally, although we saw substantial improvements in the fourth quarter, we believe that sales productivity will continue to ramp over time as our sales force matures. These factors along with the typical seasonality of the business and our expense structure are carefully factored into our near-term outlook. During Q1, we expect billings to be in the range of $380 million to $388 million, up approximately 16% year-over-year at the mid-point. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $330 million to $335 million, up 17% year-over-year at the mid-point. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 74% to 75%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 11% to 12%; this reflect the impact of lower revenue and higher cost associated with the typical first quarter as well as increased G&A expenses associated with transitioning to new accounting standards. And finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.16 based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 178 million to 180 million fully diluted shares. For 2017, we expect full year billings in the range of $1.750 billion to $1.770 billion, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.470 billion to $1.480 billion, up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 74% to 75%. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to improve to 16%. Finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of approximately $0.87 to $0.89, based on an expected diluted share count in the range of 181 million to 183 million fully diluted shares. In closing, I would like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. With that Ken, Kelly, and I\u2019ll now take your questions. Operator, you may start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Gabriela Borges : Maybe just a high level question, if I could, on the health of the environment and the overall visibility that you have into the business. In the past, there\u2019s been a little bit of discussion around sales cycles elongating and digestion of product. Maybe you could just give us an update there and in general on the broader willingness of customers to spend on network security today. Thank you. Drew Del Matto : Sure, Gabriela. I would start with I think the general environment. Customers are very willing to spend on security and certainly network security. The trends of consolidation, cloud, mobile, IoT, the next-gen architectures continue to be in the forefront of their mind. What we have seen in the past is that we\u2019ve just seen the elongated sales cycles. We seem to close -- we did a good job of closing what we had on the table in Q4. I would say, overall, there is still some digesting out there, certainly still some of this digesting phase, customers are still evaluating, and hopefully over the next couple of years, they move certainly into the more of the purchase stage. Ken Xie : This is Ken. I think we see some new trend like last year and also 2015, you see some rush buying for [indiscernible]. Now, it\u2019s a kind of a new trend really to secure the infrastructure. So, that the fabric method [ph] working quite well, whether internal segmentation, or how to secure whole infrastructure is just a few point in the network side. That\u2019s actually helping drive a lot of bigger deals and new growth opportunities. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : I wondered if you could go a little bit deeper on the cloud. You mentioned the cloud business double. But, can you give us a sense, how much of that business is under the meter business model; how much of that is actual virtual firewall versus physical appliances that might be going into private cloud or other types of cloud implementations where it\u2019s still a physical appliance versus virtual? Drew Del Matto : The metered model piece, Sterling, is the smallest component; I would say, the virtual machine piece is the next; and then, obviously, the hardware is still predominant. We gave an example -- I think we gave a couple of examples of hybrid models where they are building out infrastructure, and one of the appeal -- part of the appeal of the fabric is clearly that not only can they expand, whether it\u2019s hardware or metered model, do it globally with AWS and us or whatever -- whoever, whichever cloud provider they provide, given that flexibility and that advantage. And what they really like I believe is the breadth of our product portfolio, what the fabric provides there. And we heard a lot in security orchestration, the fact that we could basically keep all the things updated at end-to-end and do it virtual, physical and basically allow them to expand as they want. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Melissa Gorham with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Melissa Gorham : So, Drew, you talked about better sales productivity this quarter. And over the past, I guess year or so, you\u2019ve talked about making tweaks to the sales force and I think you talked about it last quarter as well. So, can we assume that those changes are now over and productivity is just going to be coming from the sales force getting more mature or are you still making any material changes to the sales force? Drew Del Matto : I\u2019ll start with the last part of your question. We don\u2019t see any material changes certainly at this point, Melissa. But we do believe there\u2019s room to drive higher productivity, and we\u2019re continually focused through that through our marketing efforts; we\u2019re fighting our lead generation, our training, and just building that end-to-end go-to-market model. We really do believe we\u2019re doing better that feels like the engine is more in place, but there\u2019s probably still quite honestly some work to do there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, it\u2019s Jim on for Walter. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. Drew, it looks like you hired about just under 50 heads in the quarter, which is the lowest amount since 2010. Are you guys thinking that you\u2019re at full scale now or how should we think about hiring activity as we progress through fiscal 2017 and 2018? Drew Del Matto : Well, we\u2019ve given you the guidance on margins, Jim. I think it\u2019s obviously headcounts reflected in that. We were very focused on driving productivity. We were very focused on -- the model here is a lean, flat organization with low friction. And what we did was reduced admin and overlay layers, really with the ultimate goal of driving high velocity and getting better visibility from top to bottom of the Company. And so, we\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019re going to continue to hire though; we absolutely are -- we believe we have opportunity to grow, as reflected obviously in our guidance. And so, we\u2019ll continue to hire. So, I wouldn\u2019t look at past -- last quarter\u2019s hiring rate as an indication fairly of the future. I would just look more to the guidance that we gave. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. Saket Kalia : Drew, can you just remind us about how big the non-FortiGate part of the business is? Security Fabric has been out for a little while now. So, could you just maybe frame roughly what percentage of the business has been non-FortiGate pieces, and how fast that\u2019s growing? Drew Del Matto : It\u2019s hard to share numbers, but I would say it\u2019s getting more meaningful. I would say that it was slightly less than double from last quarter. So, it\u2019s growing very nicely. One thing I would point out with the enterprise bundles, which I called out I think a few times in the script, were very good story, where we\u2019re seeing a nice uptake on that. And that really came out in Q2. We saw nice quarter in Q3 on those nice uptake and we saw even better in Q4, and basically that\u2019s just a higher price bundle with ATP and mobile added. So, those drivers altogether really form the fabric and beyond story, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing customers really -- we\u2019re really helping them support the next-gen architectures. Operator : And our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal : Drew or Ken, last quarter, you mentioned some macro issues impacting, I believe it was your UK, Latin American operations; clearly this quarter\u2019s results stand in sharp contrast. Just trying to understand if some of those third quarter headwinds are gradually subsiding or was that strictly improved execution and discipline this quarter? Drew Del Matto : Well, I would start with -- I think it was clearly better productivity or execution overall for sure. The fabric is a good story, Shaul; it\u2019s resonating. And some of the items I just shared with Saket, I think kind of help illustrate that customers are really taking to the fabric story. So that\u2019s really I think the first point. The only macro issue that I would really sight this quarter would be Brazil, which -- if you go a year back, it would have been a very good story and beyond that -- prior to that strong -- very strong country for us. And that continues to be a very challenging country. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open. Gregg Moskowitz : Is there any additional color that you can provide on the sales productivity improvements this quarter? In other words, is there something perhaps that you can point to in lead gen, sales on-boarding et cetera that gives you confidence that the performance you saw in Q4 is more than just strong Q4 seasonality and a likely budget for us? Drew Del Matto : Yes, I think probably just some seasoning of the team. You bring in -- we got in a lot of people. I think sometimes it just takes time for the gears to connect completely, especially when you are building a lot of functions at the same time. And so, I think that\u2019s the piece of it, the season, and you get more focused, things get easier. I would add and repeat what I said earlier, I do believe that having a flatter, leaner administrative and overlay function really does create greater visibility and focus on what we need to do to accomplish and achieve. And I think that\u2019s what we did. Ken Xie : And also, we are enhancing [ph] the lead gen, the marketing side; that also will help in improve the [indiscernible]. And I think the process to increase the productivity is still ongoing. And we still try to keeping improving the structure and also supporting by the other part like marketing, some other customer supporting and also the new launch of the product to keeping driving the growth. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hi guys, couple of questions. Obviously, it was a great rebound in products growth, especially, I mean services were strong too but fantastic to see that reacceleration of product. Looking at your guidance in the 1Q and assuming kind of seasonality and reasonable conservativeness, it still looks like you\u2019ve been making some services that the product guide on a year-over-year basis looks pretty weak. So, is that just down 1% it looks like, and it\u2019s just an estimate. But there is something that -- have visibility that strength you saw in product this quarter could continue into next quarter? Drew Del Matto : It\u2019s very hard to predict, Michael. Clearly, there is a shift going on with us and others, it feels industry-wide where you see the shift and obviously on the virtual side, some cloud. And then, we just see more of a waiting towards services. And this is -- a lot of this is by design by the way. We are really trying to wait the money -- we are really trying to drive to higher customer lifetime value. And the way you do that is attribute more to the recurring higher profitability side of the business. And as we look at the enterprise bundle for instance, that\u2019s clearly a vehicle to do that, and it\u2019s working. And so, it\u2019s kind of hard to predict. And also the only other point I would lay out there, some of the earlier questions around just the general environment. You still have to be, let\u2019s say, cautiously optimistic as customers are really still evaluating to the large extent their next gen architecture, there is still some digestion. And obviously, we have to push as hard as we can, but I think we have to have the appropriate level of caution. Michael Turits : And then, the follow-up is on CapEx, which is significantly higher. I know you say that was 15 to 20; I think you said it was pushed off from this year to next. But it\u2019s still mid $100 million to $200 million and it\u2019s really high. So, obviously, you don\u2019t give 2018 guidance, but should we -- how long before this accelerated CapEx spends are over? So, we think about 2018 as being back to a normal year or percent of revenues in backend or something [Multiple Speaker]? Drew Del Matto : Sure, Michael. Yes. Sorry, and I have to take debate on correcting you; it wasn\u2019t $200 million... Michael Turits : No, it\u2019s 1 to 200, not 200 sorry, 1 to 200. Drew Del Matto : No, I didn\u2019t say that. I said -- I think I said 130 to 150 or 140 to 150. We can go back and check that, but the -- I believe 150 was the top end. And that\u2019s real estate and our normal run rate, if you will, about the CapEx. We will continue it for couple of years. Now, at that level, it\u2019s hard to predict -- as you could see, just even in last quarter when we held to the CapEx guidance that we were off significantly, part of it has to do with buying mobile products, purchases and how people buy and how people sell those properties. And it just takes a while and then it takes a while to get permits and all of this. So, we\u2019re kind of thinking over the next several years, we\u2019ll see some of this. I\u2019m really guiding out, but I would say that continue to be some real estate, over time as we clear one property and then we do look to build a campus there around the HQ area. And just by the way, I mean if we can find a better opportunity, we\u2019re clearly going to look at that, we\u2019re married to any given location; we\u2019re trying to do the best thing. And I would remind you, everything we\u2019re doing, we believe is accretive. One thing I would point out on real estate, we bought a warehouse about a year ago, and we were running out of space, so we bought a warehouse. And part of the reason the product gross margin is up is because the warehouse is now driving margin benefit or scale benefit that we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise seen. So, if you do buy these properties, you can be in them anyway, it does make sense to buy them. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open. Jonathan Ho : I just wanted to start off with the North American enterprise. And can you talk about maybe the recovery there? And is there sort of further opportunity to see improvement and what are some amount of the big changes that may be had an impact? Ken Xie : Yes. This is Ken. Definitely, there is a lot of room for improving in the North American enterprise. And not only just enterprise but also see some opportunity from the carrier service provider, the cloud side and also the channel SMB side. But, it\u2019s starting more focus on enterprise, we made some improvement but there is still a lot of room to grow compared to some other competitors. And that\u2019s where the enhancement of the marketing like lead gen, some other channel program and also starting helping them, starting to see some good results. So, we like I said, just coming from the Partner Conference in about a couple of weeks ago, we see the partner -- some customers also -- they see a pretty -- enthusiasm we see from the conference is much stronger than we see before, and they all like the new program and also the new product we\u2019re offering. And that\u2019s really, if you can, really helping the growth going forward. Drew Del Matto : I think the vision, Jonathan, when I talk to customers and when Ken and I talk to customers, the vision resonates the breadth of portfolio, the Fabric Story. And you really see -- I do think the non-FortiGate sales are an illustration of the uptake in the fabric and resonance of that with our customers. And again, they want to buy more security; they want to buy sensibly; they want it to work across their network and through IoT into the cloud. And we\u2019re giving them that vision, and I think the vision part of it is not to be underestimated. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is now open. Catharine Trebnick : Thanks for taking my question; my has to do with the service provider segment, Ken. What type of opportunities are you seeing for the virtual firewall? Ken Xie : I think like a couple of months, we started integrate the cloud and that carrier service provider came together, and that\u2019s actually -- it\u2019s a long-term vision we have, eventually like some of the cloud provider also become some service provider. And also I mentioned in script, we see the cloud business grow faster than other part of our business. And we have the best carrier service provider position among all the other competitors because of our strong cloud offering and also the virtualized and also the hardware performance is a huge advantage. But we also see the -- the service provider also starting transition themselves little bit from the traditional carrier offer some [indiscernible] they also started offering additional service and also some content there. So, that\u2019s why we feel we\u2019re well-positioned to drive the future business there, whether into the cloud or the mobile, we have market opportunities both on the product offerings and new service offerings. Drew Del Matto : Other than that, what we\u2019re hearing out of that sector is just that -- as they go more virtual, they do talk about that. It actually creates more complexity and it requires -- it necessitates more performance and really the breadth of security. And again, similar to my last answer, it is the fabric resonating. It\u2019s the ability to provide the high performance, obviously procedures [ph] provide and I think we had a -- we\u2019ve got some announcements recently on our high performance products but those are drivers along with complexities and the breadth of security, the breadth of security we provide is critical. Ken Xie : Also, I mentioned we deliver the security to the cloud and for the cloud. So, that\u2019s both with the service provider offer to the customer and also for the cloud provider themselves, as a lot of opportunity we see. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open. Hendi Susanto : Drew, how should we think of the tax framework if the U.S. government lowers the federal tax rate under the new administration? Drew Del Matto : It\u2019s very early and we are not -- obviously not quite sure what will happen there. We would hope that it would be obviously a tailwind, but there is so much variability in there right now, it\u2019s just hard to predict. For right now, we will just stay where we\u2019re modeled. And then, when we get beyond kind of all the, if you will, dialog and back forth phase, I think we\u2019ll have a better opportunity to give you firmer guidance. Hendi Susanto : And then, if I may ask one question for Ken. Ken, now that we\u2019ve finished the year 2016, would you be able to shed some color on how much penetration your subscription business is today versus a year ago and how much upside opportunities remaining? Ken Xie : Subscription, you mean the\u2026 Drew Del Matto : The mix is higher. Ken Xie : You mean enterprise service model or\u2026 Drew Del Matto : Hendi, I think you are talking about the mix, I mean which would\u2026 Hendi Susanto : Product\u2026 Drew Del Matto : Clearly be higher, the product is primarily hardware. So most of the subscription fall to deferred because they are delivered over time or they would fall in service line -- service revenue line as they\u2019re amortized. So, you would really have the numbers. The only other thing I would go back to the fact that we just have more types of virtual products and term licenses and so forth, and the enterprise security which is obviously part of what\u2019s driving higher deferred. Ken Xie : Also we started offer like we call the enterprise bundle about two, three quarters ago, we see very strong growth, almost quarter-over-quarter, and that\u2019s really helping the service part and also helping the margin. So, that\u2019s where offered additional ATP and also mobile cloud security in enterprise bundle. We see a lot of customer need this additional service is one of the strong driver of the gross margin and growth. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Lucia with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. John Lucia : Most of the major firewall vendors talk about providing firewall capabilities on-premise and in the cloud being able to connect the two; they also talk about consolidation around the firewall in terms of subscription services. Can you just give us little more detail on what makes the Fortinet Fabric differentiated versus the others, particularly as it relates to the cloud and the integration there? Ken Xie : Yes. We definitely see the strong demand for both on-premise as well as on cloud and also the balance of two deployment but also we have additional in the fabric like from the endpoint working with other. Also we mostly partner with some other endpoint provider people together and same time, we have access path that\u2019s FortiWiFi other competitor has. And then we have the application that we mentioned FortiMail, FortiWeb and some DDoS deployment is also helping, and that\u2019s we also offer pretty strong solution there and then pass the cloud IoT. So, we have a -- I think we are number one on the unit deployed globally, probably more than double the number two. That\u2019s also helping driving these broad favorable solutions. And we also see some other networking gears starting connect together. So, we also offer, both the secured monitor application with some other networking device and especially try to do the security and analysis part. So that also drives a lot of, what we call, the fabric growth. John Lucia : And then one more question. Your revenue was much better than expected and OpEx came in a little lower than our estimate. I would have expected variable expenses to be higher due to the revenue outperformance. I just wanted to see, if there were any expenses that push into Q1. And I know you had maybe a lower headcount than you wanted in Q4. Then also just if there has been any change in terms of thinking around investing; is there any reason why you wouldn\u2019t pull forward that goal of 20% operating margin exiting 2020, given the outperformance here? Drew Del Matto : So, I think there are couple of questions in there. First of all, we clearly can\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t -- I think you asked me if I pushed out any expenses; is that the first question? John Lucia : Yes from Q4 into Q1? Drew Del Matto : I said it already. I think you\u2019re asking about why wouldn\u2019t -- because commissions would be the major variable expense I think. It will grow obviously the margin line, as you saw another product, you have to expense the hardware. That would be one thing, but the commissions would be the other. And commissions is on as a percent of billing. And so, as we drive operational efficiencies and I think we remove the overlays, we end up with a more efficient structure. And that\u2019s really the answer of how we did it in Q4. We started those things in Q3; they certainly bore fruit in Q4. And also just other expense, just expense discipline, I would say, grown the Company, just more focus on expense discipline, which will continue. As far as go forward, you have our guidance. We\u2019re committed to the 20%, existing 20; we remain committed and we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Taz Koujalgi : I do have a question on the subscription business, different bundles. It seems like you have three bundles now. You have the old traditional bundles you had, the enterprise bundle, I think in Q4 you launched the 360 bundle. Can you talk about how much -- what was the mix in the quarter among those three bundles? Drew Del Matto : I don\u2019t have a mix to share. I think Ken shared that the enterprise bundle just about doubled quarter-over-quarter, slightly less than that to be fair. But, it was a nice -- and I think we even mentioned in Q3 that it was a nice ramp. So, that we\u2019ve seen a nice uptick there. But the three bundles are the core UTM bundle, which is our traditional bundle. A reminder, we raised prices on that just about two years ago. And then the enterprise bundle which was really Q2 of this year. We\u2019ve been out there sort of but we hadn\u2019t really been marketing it through all the price books, just kind of testing it. And then that had a nice ramp throughout the year since Q2. And then the 360 bundle, and I think that was a little early because, in that is the SIEM, and we\u2019re just early, FortiSIEM is in that, it\u2019s just still little early, we just integrated that in Q3 really. Ken Xie : We\u2019re still moving that; 368 bundle is still in the trial, beta stage that really launched. Drew Del Matto : Yes, too early. It\u2019s in there but it\u2019s too early. Taz Koujalgi : What is the difference in price points in those three bundles? Drew Del Matto : I don\u2019t have. Ken Xie : It\u2019s on the copy for sure there, but also think the 360, we still try to improve in a handset; I don\u2019t think we formally launched in some of country region yet. Drew Del Matto : Here, I have it. We do have the bundle. We of course have the template handy. So, on the UTM bundle, 24 with -- and I\u2019m just doing it -- you can give me an 855 24x7 or 360. The 24x7 support was for UTM with 65% of the hardware price, Taz. And the enterprise bundle is 90% of the hardware price and 24x7. And that\u2019s in our template, if you have one of those. Taz Koujalgi : And did you mention you\u2019ve given the -- did you give the price for the 360 bundle? Drew Del Matto : I\u2019m sorry, 360, just a second. You go -- so for UTM\u2026 Taz Koujalgi : That\u2019s added 10? Drew Del Matto : Yes, you would add 10 percentage points. So, for UTM -- you can get 360 either with UTM or enterprise, and basically that includes FortiSIEM and some monitoring of your system to see kind of where you need to have the devices so to speak around the -- in your environment. And so that\u2019s at the UTM level, 75% of the hardware price versus 65% for the 24x7. And then in the enterprise bundle, the 24x7, as I said was 90% of the hardware price but if you buy this 360 option, it\u2019s at 100% of the hardware price but again that one is a little early. Ken Xie : Basically 360 just has a health check for other deployment that will help monitor how the deployment going on like weekly or monthly. So, let\u2019s add 10% on top of that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mike Feldman : Hi guys, this is Mike Feldman on for Tal, thanks for taking my question. Service provider was good sequentially but year-over-year the growth still continues to decelerate, I believe it was up only about 6%. What\u2019s causing the slowdown in that environment and what are your expectations for 2017? And then separately, have you seen any change to the run rate in that environment given the increasing competition in Palo Alto and Check Point, both of those companies have some new higher end firewalls addressing that market? Drew Del Matto : 2016, I think we did very well globally quite frankly, I think some select providers probably more in the U.S. 2016 was more of a valuation year we think. 2017, more likely a decision year probably in the back half of the year somewhere is what we\u2019re hearing. We hear that they\u2019re more focused on virtual solutions and CapEx and what we\u2019re hearing is that we\u2019re the best provider with our fabric again, with breadth of portfolio, security orchestration, end-to-end through IoT to the cloud, whether they\u2019re using it internally or externally and I think they\u2019re trying to basically doing the same for both. And then obviously in service provider, we provide performance that none of the competitors actually can provide. And we don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t lost any deal to them that we\u2019re aware of. So, I don\u2019t think any of that\u2019s changed. Ken Xie : Also we\u2019re launching the new product like the 7000 series, 7040 about quarter ago, now we just launched the 7060. So that\u2019s the farthest next generation product in the whole industry and also the highest product in our own product line. Plus this 3980, that\u2019s a single appliance, I don\u2019t see any competitor have single appliance can deliver service throughput. That\u2019s also kind of a sometime customer want a evaluate its product and same time like Drew said, a lot of service providers, carrier cloud providers, they are also changing their business model from offering security line, now they also add additional service and also compensate. So with all this evaluation, sometime the decision can be longer. And also the new product received very strong interest from all the customers, service providers. So, we do see quite a lot of potential going forward. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Fenn Hoffman : Hi guys. This is actually Fenn Hoffman on for Ken. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to dig a little deeper, if I could on the enterprise subscription bundles. If you have a sense for whether the growth there is being driven primarily by new sales or sales to existing clients? Thanks. Drew Del Matto : It\u2019s probably both. It\u2019s just hard to break that out right now, too early to tell. But it\u2019s probably both. I mean, we are obviously offering it both and then you would generally see it on a new product deployment. Fenn Hoffman : And just a quick follow-up if I could. You guys saw quite a jump in deals over 500,000. I am just wondering what some of the primary drivers behind those have been? Drew Del Matto : Just enterprise focus; I think it\u2019s just a signal that better execution in the enterprise globally. Ken Xie : Also the fabric story also makes the deal larger, because there is multiple products starting together, not just the FortiGate, but also like I mentioned from the mail and also some even some WiFi. Operator : And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kelly Blough for closing remarks. Kelly Blough : We want to thank everyone again for participating in the call today. If you want -- if you have further questions, please dial in for the Q&A session that begins at 3 :30 Pacific Time. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

We also encourage you to refer to the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fortinet.com for important information, including our earnings press release issued a few minutes ago, the slides that accompany today's prepared remarks, and other important information about the company. A replay of this call will also be available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thank you, Kelly, and thanks for everyone joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2017 results. In the first quarter, Fortinet delivered billings and revenue growth that exceeded our guidance, and continued to surpass the market growth rate. We continue to improve our profitability. And as we have discussed in the past, we plan to steadily increase our operating margins to create additional value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, we saw strength in the large multi-product deals, demonstrating that the security fabric architecture is continuing to gain mind-share and market-share for Fortinet. Our customer and partners recognize that our competitors' multiple point products and loosely integrated solutions do not provide the breadth, depth, performance and orchestration needed to address the demands of today's digital economy. The Fortinet Security Fabric is cohesive, multi-product platform that works together to detect, monitor, block and remediate attacks against the entire enterprise surface area, responding to our customers' need for a seamless, tightly integrated approach to security that protects all points in the network. Enterprises do not have to sacrifice their network performance to ensure that their networks are secure in this highly competitive and evolving landscape. Our latest next generation firewalls, the FortiGate 7000 series with the 7030E, 7040E and 7060E deliver ultra-high speed Next Generation Firewall and advanced threat protection in a flexible chassis-based form-factor, based on the latest CP9 security processor. Many security vendors detect threats, some prevent them with integrated solutions, but only Fortinet excel in all five stages of network security : detection, prevention, integration, performance and value. As we continue to land and expand into some of the largest enterprise corporations and government organizations in the world, we again added more than 10,000 new customers during the quarter. This brings the total to more than 310,000 customers worldwide. Broader adoption of the Security Fabric also result in increased sales in the quarter of non-FortiGate solutions. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce that several leading technology companies joined the Fortinet Security Fabric-Ready ecosystem, including Cisco, Hewlett Packard, Nuage Networks from Nokia and more. To date, Fortinet has 22 Fabric-Ready Program Partners, representing a cross-section of leading information technology providers whose offerings are tightly integrated with the Fortinet Security Fabric. This open approach enable multiple vendors' security solutions to share actionable threat intelligence and mitigation information in real-time. We are also pleased to announce early this month that Fortinet has extended the core capabilities of our Security Fabric architecture to enable businesses to experience the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence in cloud environments as they do in their physical networks. The latest enhancement of the FortiOS 5.6 offers customers the ability to manage security capabilities across their private, public cloud and software-defined wide area network, SD-WAN, environments. Early this month, Fortinet and Vodafone announced a new global relationship to provide next generation security solutions to enterprise customers by embedding Fortinet's high-performance virtualized security solutions and integrated Security Fabric architecture within Vodafone's core network products. Our strength in cloud offering is driving demand for on-premises implementation of the Fortinet Security Fabric. By providing the highest performance, most complete and well-integrated solutions, the Fortinet Security Fabric has positioned Fortinet as an innovator and the market leader. I will now turn the call to Drew, to review our first quarter financial results and forward guidance. Andrew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. Now, let me now share our financial results for the first quarter, which can be seen on Slide 3. Fortinet had a strong start to 2017 with billings and revenue exceeding the high-end of our guidance ranges. Billings increased 22% year-over-year to $403 million. Reflected in this number is approximately $12 million from a single deal closed in the quarter. Approximately 70% of the revenue from this multi-year contract was deferred into future periods. Revenue of $341 million was up 20% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in North America, particularly in enterprise, demonstrating ongoing improvement in sales productivity. As Ken mentioned, we saw success in large deals and in multiple product deployments, demonstrating adoption of the Fortinet Security Fabric. Deferred revenue grew strongly again to $1.098 billion, up 31% year over year, reflecting the business shift to more margin rich, recurring subscription and service revenue. Sales of enterprise bundles were again strong in the first quarter, driving higher-priced and higher-margin recurring revenue over time. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 75%. Our strategic focus on driving sales of higher value, higher price, and higher-margin recurring revenue streams, such as services and virtualized product offerings contributed to our improved gross margin in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 13%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.17. Finally, we generated $116 million of free cash flow during the quarter, an increase of 65% over the first quarter of 2016. Our first quarter results benefited from customers' recognition of the value, performance, and comprehensive security coverage provided by Fortinet's Security Fabric. This was evidenced in the first quarter by continuing strength in large, multi-product deals, and sales of non-FortiGate products to enterprises. The number of deals over $100,000 grew 20%, deals over $250,000 grew 15% and deals over $500,000 grew 31%. The majority of our large deals were attributable to the key differentiators of the Fabric, particularly manageability, orchestration and integration across the enterprise. For example, in the aforementioned multi-million-dollar, multi-product contract with a large educational institution. Fortinet's technology beat out the incumbent and other competitors not only due to performance, but also to the manageability and integration capabilities that the Fabric provides. In another first quarter deal, Fortinet is being deployed in a large European financial institution, whose incumbent security solution was not scalable, powerful, or manageable enough to respond to its growing business and larger attack footprint. The customer chose Fortinet Security Fabric for our ability to provide internal segmentation and advanced threat protection in the context of a scalable, well-orchestrated, high performance solution. Cloud solutions are a critical component of the Fortinet Security Fabric, and represent a significant expansion opportunity and long-term driver of our growth. Fortinet delivers security to the cloud and for the cloud. The latest enhancements to the FortiOS enable customers to manage security capabilities across their cloud assets and software defined wireless access networks. We also announced this month the launch of FortiCASB, a cloud access security brokerage providing customers and partners, with an interface to gain visibility and control over SaaS applications through the Fortinet Security Fabric. Turning to our quarterly sales results, the breakdown of billings across our top five verticals was : service provider at 21%; government at 15%; education at 13%; financial services at 11%; and retail at 9%. On a geographic basis, billings in the Americas grew 27%, led by the United States, which outpaced all other regions in the first quarter, validating the changes that we made to our sales structure just a year-ago. EMEA billings grew 17%, and APAC billings grew 22%. Now turning to billings by product portfolio on Slide 4, high-end products accounted for 36% of total product billings, our mid-range products accounted for 31%, and our entry-level products accounted for 33%. Revenue was $341 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. As you can see on Slide 5, revenue performance was driven by the combination of 9% year-over-year product revenue growth, and 28% year-over-year services revenue growth. The continued shift to higher services growth reflects our ongoing success in driving higher-priced subscription bundles, metered model business, and virtual solutions. On a geographic basis, from a revenue standpoint, you can see on Slide 6 and 7 that revenue continues to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business. Revenue from the Americas represented 43% of our business and grew 22% year-over-year; revenue from EMEA represented 37% of our business and grew 20% year-over-year; and revenue from APAC represented 20% of our business and grew 15% year-over-year. During the first quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin was 75%. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 84%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 60%. We continue to focus on productivity and efficiency in our operating model, paying close attention to the growth in billings versus operating expenses. On a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, billings grew by 22%, while sales and marketing expense grew just - by just 16%. As expected, general and administrative expenses were elevated in the first quarter due in part to preparations for our implementation of the new revenue accounting standard. In all, year-over-year we had $73 million of incremental billings, on just $31 million in incremental operating expense. As a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 44%, down from 46% in the first quarter of last year, research and development expenses were 13% flat from last year, and general and administrative expenses were 5% also flat with last year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $211 million during the first quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $43 million, or 13% of total revenue, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $31 million or $0.17 per share, based on approximately 178 million diluted shares outstanding. As expected, the annualized non-GAAP tax rate declined to 32%. As seen on Slide 8 and 9, we ended the first quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $1,444 million in cash and investments. Free cash flow in the quarter was $116 million, an increase of 65% over the first quarter of 2016. Annualized inventory turns for Q1 were 1.6. Inventory turns were lower than expected in the first quarter due to early receipt of $8 million of inventory that was scheduled for Q2 delivery, and due to a ramp in inventory for our transition from the D to E series of appliances. We expect to normalize our inventory turns to 2 or better over the next several quarters. Deferred revenue increased to $1.098 billion, an increase of $261 million or 31% year-over-year. DSO was 71 days. Before I discuss guidance for the second quarter, I want to provide an update on our real estate plans. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we are addressing our facilities requirements over the next several years both at headquarters in California as well as in Vancouver. At the beginning of the year, we guided $140 million to 150 million in CapEx for 2017, including approximately $120 million on real estate. Earlier this month, we concluded the purchase of the Vancouver building, so the vast majority of the real estate CapEx for 2017 will occur in the second quarter, affecting our Q2 free cash flow. We expect to return to strong free cash flow generation in the second half of the year. Let me now finish with our guidance for the second quarter, and updates to our previously issued guidance for the full-year, which can be seen on Slide 10. I will also address our plans for longer-term operating margin expansion. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements, including all of the guidance statements provided, are subject to Kelly's cautions at the start of this call. Fortinet's market opportunity and competitive advantage is significant. Our investments have helped lay the foundation for our future growth, share gains, increasing profitability, and shareholder value creation. As I have mentioned, our model is shifting toward more margin-rich services revenue, which tends to have a higher ratio of deferral. These factors along with typical seasonality of the business and our expense structure are carefully factored into our near-term outlook. For the second quarter of 2017, we expect billings in the range of $425 million to $432 million, revenue in the range of $357 million to $363 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 75%, non-GAAP operating margin of 14% to 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.20. We are updating our guidance for the full-year 2017 to reflect the first quarter's performance. For 2017, we now expect billings in the range of $1.770 billion to $1.792 billion, revenue in the range of $1.485 billion to $1.495 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 75%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.89 to $0.91. We had approximately $2 million of overachievement in non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter, which equates to approximately 10 to 20 basis points of operating margin on the full-year at the middle of the range. We are adding that to our non-GAAP operating margin expectation for the year. I'd like to conclude with some commentary on our longer-term operating model. As you know, over the last couple of years Fortinet has carefully considered our investment strategy to find an appropriate balance between high revenue growth and profitability. We made critical investments in sales and marketing to broaden our go to market capabilities, and focused on driving higher margin recurring revenue streams. In 2016, these efforts delivered non-GAAP operating margin improvements of approximately 200 basis points, exceeding our operating margin guidance despite the dilution from the acquisition of AccelOps. We remain focused on driving higher sales productivity and maintaining a flat organization. We also have made a number of model and productivity improvements, and changes to our operating structure to increase profitability. As our Q1 results illustrate, we are seeing the benefits of our focus, efforts and strategy. We meet with shareholders frequently, and have heard from many of you that you would like more clarity and definition related to our path to operating margin improvement. In response to this feedback, and recognizing the importance of increased profitability to our business and our shareholders, we are updating our margin targets as well as the milestones we expect to achieve to get there. We plan to add 150 to 200 basis points to operating margins each year following 2017, reaching a minimum non-GAAP operating margin of 25% by 2022, and remaining thereafter in the 25% to 30% range. We appreciate our shareholders' feedback, and we welcome an ongoing dialogue with you on how to improve our business and increase shareholder value. Now, I'll hand the call back to Ken to close. Ken Xie : Thank you, Drew. We are very pleased with our first quarter results and with the progress that Fortinet is making. The Fortinet Security Fabric is winning in the marketplace and we are gaining market share against our competitors. We believe the long-term operating model that Drew just outlined will bring the best value to our shareholders. Our first quarter results illustrate that our strategy to expand operating margin is working. And we believe our model will continue to offer improved profitability and value to our shareholders, while allowing Fortinet to remain an industry leader. In closing, I would like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers, and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Kelly Blough : Operator, you may now start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Gabriela Borges : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking in the question. Congrats on the solid results. Maybe I'll pick up right where the prepared remarks left off on the new operating model. Drew, Ken, maybe you could just comment on how you arrived at that 25%-plus target in the 2022 timeframe, and how you think about what the right level of revenue growth will be as you progress from where you are now today to that 25% level. Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Sure, Gabriela. Yes, I think we're - first of all, historically, I think a while back we were in the mid-20s. We felt like we could get back there. And if we look around the industry, we thought that was closer to a longer but term [ph] benchmark that made sense for us. We know where we made the investments. I think we've been saying all along that we like the flat model and the changes that we made over the last year and they appear to be working. And so, I think now the kind of stage two of that is really the path into driving higher productivity and operating margins over the next years. As far as revenue growth, I mean, without getting into that, we continue to want to take share. We believe our model supports doing that. Historically, we've done that and we think we can do that while also expanding margins at the same time. Ken Xie : Yes, also the Security Fabric story also starting and hence the sales, I mean, for the cross-sell for the upsell opportunity. And also, we see the security at ISP or the security processor also starting as a long advantage over competitors. That all can help in keeping expanding the margin, also help increase the growth. Gabriela Borges : Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Melissa Gorham with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Melissa Gorham : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I would want to maybe start with the deal that you mentioned at the beginning, Drew. I think it was a $12 million deal. And I'm wondering if you can maybe just provide a little bit more color as it seems pretty significant for you all. Is there anything that you can talk about in terms of whether it was a competitive displacement? And is it fair to assume that that was a multi-year deal and was that embedded in your expectations coming into Q1? Andrew Del Matto : Well, it was a competitive win. And the customer was really looking for a long-term model in their next generation architecture over the next, say, five to ten years. And it was competitive displacement. The Fabric were the key - the Fabric and performance were the keys to winning it. And, yes, it was a longer - it was a multi-year deal. I mean, what else did you ask, I'm sorry? Melissa Gorham : Was this embedded in your expectations when you're guiding Q1, this deal? Andrew Del Matto : We take variety of factors into account for the forecast, to the extent that's in the funnel, that it's weighted into the forecast decision. Melissa Gorham : Okay. Got it. And then, just one quick one on the operating margin guide. So for FY 2017 you're still looking for about 100 basis points year-over-year improvement. But it seems like the longer-term guide is looking for a little bit more of an improvement after FY 2017. So I'm just wondering why the modest operating margin improvement in FY 2017, is that just conservatism or is there some other factor to take into consideration? Andrew Del Matto : Well, actually we picked up a little bit this quarter. I think we left in the table 16% for rounding. But we picked up about $2 million that we're going to get back. That will go back into the margin improvement for the year. I think it's just 10 to 20 basis points. I think we had a paragraph on that in the script if you will. And so, we wanted to give the overall performance back. The other thing, weighting, if you add that to the $10 million for the revenue implementation, I think you get fairly close to 200 basis points for the year. Melissa Gorham : Got it, okay. Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. I want to actually ask about competitive landscape. I apologize; I missed the first few minutes of the call, if you did comment. But given all the news coming out of the various vendors in the quarter, et cetera, what are you seeing in terms of the competitive landscape? Anybody getting weaker, anybody getting stronger, any changes in who you're seeing in that kind of final shortlist in deals? Ken Xie : Sterling, this is Ken. I think in the big environment, we don't see much change compared with the last two years. And certain vertical space like some bigger provider carrier, they probably spend more time to planning. Some agencies [ph] where they transition to some cloud, some other service offering model; other part, where the enterprise SMB with UC is pretty strong. And also, the new product we offer in the e-models, starting to ramp up pretty quickly, also helping. On the competitor side, I don't see much changed. We're starting promoting. We call the Security Fabric. We have a pretty broad, probably broader than other competitor on the product portfolio here. Not just network security, but also the other part like for endpoint with the access part, with the application like web and e-mail security, and then to the cloud. So we have quite a broad offering, so the Fabric start really help and compete better compared to other competitors. So other than that, I see the whole environment pretty normal. Andrew Del Matto : Yes, Sterling, it's Drew. I would just summarize that. And that I think the consolidation theme remains profound out there. And the Fabric is clearly resonating. And the larger deals we do, it's common theme. And I think that's very consistent with what we saw in Q4 and consistent with what we'd see going forward. Ken Xie : Yes, I think some - and some like - we also improve in the sales productivity like by two points compared to one year ago. It's 46% or 44%. Andrew Del Matto : I think [indiscernible] has a percent on. Ken Xie : A percent [indiscernible]. Andrew Del Matto : Yes, but productivity, I don't - yes, productivity was good. Yes. Sterling Auty : And then just one follow-up, how would you answer - the one question that I get on a frequent basis is, okay, as we look at the shift to the cloud, moving to these virtual environments, Fortinet is long been known for having your custom ASIC and gives you performance advantages, et cetera. How does Fortinet then compete in the world of AWS and Azure and public cloud providers in that situation? Ken Xie : Like in my script we mentioned about, we offered the best cloud and also together with the on-premise solution. So the cloud starting, generate a lot of interest. They grow faster but on pretty small base right now. On the other side, customer also evaluate - it can give them some flexibility, but don't have to - I mean, saving the cost or maybe even increase the certain risk, because you have actual data in the cloud and also have to increase the bandwidth for accessing the cloud. So there is always a sort of balance point and whether using see some cloud also using some on-premise, that's where the hybrid solution probably will be the best. So customer can like changing their like a balance point based on their need at certain point. So I think cloud have to offer certainly flexibility, but there is other part need to be considered. So that I believe the vendor side, they need to offer both. And if only one part of it, it's more difficult to meet customer demand. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Yes. And it's also - right now, it's helping pull through on-premise for us as well, Sterling. Ken Xie : Yes, also the new security processor also being used by lot of cloud provider, service provider, because they can drive much better performance and efficiency policy when compared with the traditional CPU. They can easily improve the performance like 10 to 100 axiom [ph], then consume like a few percent of the power consumption. So there is a lot of advantage. And also in the SMB in the - at our branch office to access the cloud that's where the low-end we see pretty healthy growth also. Sterling Auty : That makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Casado with Pacific Crest. Your line is now open. Rob Owens : Great. Sorry to disappoint, this is actually Rob Owens in for Mike Casado. So hi, guys. A couple of things - dovetailing Sterling's question a little bit, so thanks for the color on the competitive landscape. Can you also talk about where you think we are in terms of the firewall cycle? Are there still firewall cycles, is there any anticipated refresh. We are starting to pick up through some of our channel work that people are looking optimistically at next year. So just some broader color in terms of where you think we are in terms of an overall industry refresh cycle first? Thanks. Ken Xie : I think that refresh cycle, probably, we see the buying pattern in like two years ago kind of - we call the rush buying. Now, newly the network security equipment probably will survive for four, five years. And then they start gliding [ph] the cycle there. I think a few are like under one, two, three year to go. But also the service providers, under like a lot of us being branch office, we also see pretty strong demand, and also because the cybersecurity is always the most important part of IT, the total percentage also keep increasing. So we do see the overall market growing pretty healthy. And a lot of existing customers, they also want to expand beyond just the traditional firewall. That's where the Fabric, the Security Fabric stories starting working much better than just to refresh the firewall. So basically you can cover from endpoint, to the access, to the networking side with traditional firewall doing, and also the application, and then the cloud. So that's where tie all this together has a much better solution feature compared to refreshing. So we see all these studying kind of helping the growth. Andrew Del Matto : Rob, we were talking about this earlier today actually. And we always thought that target, if you go back - I think it was late 2013. That was really the kick off for the last big I think spike if you will in the spending. And then it went on for couple of years, obviously. And that, when you get into 2018 that's four years roughly from, say, that happened and then understanding [ph] it started to happen in 2014, early 2014. I think probably somewhere in 2018, you would begin to see that click in the [four to fifteen] [ph] I think the consolidation theme probably does create an opportunity from the Fabric perspective for us. And that's really how we are thinking about this opportunity. Rob Owens : Great. I appreciate the color. And then second, if I look at your sequential services revenues, I guess, going back historically it was flat up or down a couple of percent. But last year you saw a spike sequentially from Q4 to Q1 in services. So maybe talk about why this is more normal seasonality and remind us what happened in that year-ago period Q1 2016 that drove that services spike? And I apologize, if this was referenced earlier, I was late to the call. Thanks. Andrew Del Matto : The services spike - I actually think that the answer this year is probably more due to Q3 this year. We had a softer Q3. And so, you don't see as much of the registrations come through in Q1, when you would expect the revenue to lift up, start amortizing. Rob Owens : Thank you. Ken Xie : Also, we starting offer the, what we call the enterprise bundle, which has more service component, but one year ago. That also started helping to see the service percentage get higher now. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Ken, could you talk about the non-FortiGate business, the size of that and how you are thinking about that kind of medium-term in terms of how large that may be come as a percentage of your revenue? Ken Xie : The non-FortiGate side grew faster than FortiGate. And also feed in the total solution covered a whole infrastructure is that just some network side looks much better. I don't think we disclose the detail percentage yet, but it's starting to get - definitely grow faster than the FortiGate. Drew, any data we can\u2026? Andrew Del Matto : Yes, Walter, I mean, I don't think we are giving numbers out, but I - generally speaking that's been the story for the last couple of quarters. Where we've seen a nice uptick on the Fabric, and then illustrated the non-FortiGate project - products that's doing well. We also look at the number of Fabric customers if you will. And that's been growing very nicely and nice trend there which adds to it. And then finally, the enterprise bundle again it was a very strong story in Q1, and very consistent with last several quarters. So we are seeing a lot of consistency in kind of the themes internally around productivity seem to be lifting and part of it doing just do selling multi-product deals, selling non-FortiGate products, up selling the bundle, the enterprise bundle, and so very good on that front. Walter Pritchard : Andrew, just a follow-up here, is it fair to say that if that business were more than 10% your revenue, you would break it out was non-FortiGate? Andrew Del Matto : Yes, we haven't decided on that one, Walter. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Nolan with Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson Nolan : Okay, great. Thank you. And Drew, I wanted to follow-up on the updated operating model it seems like sales and marketing were offer the most long-term leverage, and I guess on the question is what's the change now versus the previous guidance. Is the expectation for your headcounts ads going forward, and sales are changing. And how you market the products or any more color there would be great? Andrew Del Matto : Well, a couple of things like I did think you want to start with the top line, Jayson. So we are doing - the strategy around creating the higher margin, higher price recurring revenue streams. That's obviously coming through, you could see in the billings, and you could see in the deferred revenue. We expect that drive value to the gross margin line over time. And then as you move down in to sales and marketing, that's where the bulk of our investments, or if we go back historically that's where we want to see the productivity. And the way, you get there is some of the things you were taking about, Jayson, but really what to trying to do is give them opportunity to sell more at higher price, and so I think we are doing well on that firm, we just talked about the non-FortiGate sales and the Fabric sales. So that's one dimension of that. Then the other thing, we didn't, if you look at the pivot we made in August to really go to, what I would call a flatter very customer centric sales model. That part is working very well. And from customer centric, I mean, we are very focused direct touch reps versus overlays, and very direct SE coverage, more direct contact with the customer. We still have - we are still very focused on the channel, but we have just more direct customer touch. And that was the focus really scaling up the augment functions over time, and that's where you would have less headcount over time on those functions. We also think the marketing the go-to-market and to the marketing is working, training helps, you got higher productivity through training. We made investments there those are beginning to scale, and show fruit in terms of the Fabric sales and just the higher productivity overall. So that's really the story there, when you look down the line on R&D and G&A, you probably expect to go a little more out of G&A over time then R&D, certainly the revenue project goes away at some point for instance. And we should see those benefits over time. Ken Xie : Yes, also there are some change in the whole environment, I think you can see in the last few years some competitor were aggressively to the marketing sales, it's very difficult to sustain the long-term. And if you - right now, the whole inventory [ph] study more look in how to be a little bit more efficient healthy model and sustain long-term, as also like we also believe this long-term model probably can would be better for the shareholder and for the company also. Jayson Nolan : Ken, make sense. And then follow-up, like Ken, on ASIC refresh calendar, any color you can provide on refresh around the network processor, it seems like it would be important for the high-end of your customer base? Ken Xie : Yes, we have a three security processor like pretty much every year there is one new come up, because on average it takes about three year to build the security processor. So the CP9 we just mentioned like come up study helping the high end especially to 7000 series, and there is also IOC, and that's in the network processor. I think, they are not directly impact revenue, because they still needed some to build into the product, and then we refresh products like few products every quarter pretty smoothly, steady, helping the growth. But you can see the latest offer we made on a 7000 series that leverage latest security processor CP9 can help the performance grows a lot. And then we probably see the other next generation like IOC that also can easily improve the performance multiple times. That's also what keep the cost the same. That's also helping the growth a lot. But I say, while keeping probably on average one new offering or regression [ph] per year on the security process side. Jayson Nolan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore. Your line is now open. Kenneth Talanian : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first, I was wondering if you could discuss any changes that you've made either your hiring processes, your systems, to better manage your OpEx? Andrew Del Matto : Well, Ken, we are very focused on making sure that we look at every open headcount rack and every - the background - everyone coming in the door. And that's part of the flat structure that we are talking about were Ken and myself, and Lisa, our VP of HR are all focused on looking at every rack and every person comes in the door and there background makes sure it's fit. We also evaluate where we are, and I think the key here is you want to bring people in, you want to make sure that they are going into place, we feel there fertility and opportunity for them to be productive both near and long-term. And so that's we are really trying to do. And then balance, the purchase investments we have over time in to their roles. And last thing I would add is, when you think about the ramp of this. You want to do it in the way that doesn't create disruption, because clearly if you go too fast, it just becomes disruptive. And that's how we think about, but we really want to keep a flat organization very much, and we've been saying this for several quarters now later focused on productivity, and that is the primary driver. Ken Xie : And also the mid-20 operation margin, we have achieved that in 2012. So we have reached a level before, and then just in the last few years, we kind of more invention of growth. Now kind of more go back to the normal and take care both the profit and the growth side. Kenneth Talanian : Okay. And I just curious, if the economy were return negative over the next few years, or the security market were return. Would you be willing to forego top line growth to hit those margin targets? Ken Xie : I think, in the industry for like 20 plus years. Sometime even when economy goes slow, we are not impact security that much, because if you want to keep the security. And also security is pretty sticky and is it difficult to replace, the cost could be higher. Andrew Del Matto : Ken, I think the - look the answer is, you obviously want to step back and look at what's going on in the industry. But we are very focused and committed to driving the higher margins. I mean that's the model we are operating under, and again we are trying to ramp there in a productive way, if you will. We feel like, we've done a very good job of building the model, we wanted to do over the last couple of years in terms of our go to market adjustments that we've made, you will find those and then you are very focused on the higher margin recurring revenue streams, which are also coming in. so that that's what we are going. Kenneth Talanian : Okay. Thank you very much. Kelly Blough : And I want to say, we've got about 10 more people lined up for questions. So if I may have to try to restrict people to single questions going forward. And then we can follow-up again on the second call, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turitz with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turitz : Hey, good evening to Drew, and Ken, and Kelly. So very good to see the milestones on the margin, and the guide to 150 to 200 bps after 2017. But let me take it from this margin question with slightly different perspective, which is - why in theory couldn't we get to 20% plus margins even sooner? And when you were at mid-20s margins, when you are much smaller company growing with less scale and growing over 20%. So what's different about now, what's change that you actually have to invest in a higher rate, you couldn't get there even sooner in that. Andrew Del Matto : Well, Michael, I think, you want to balance productivity, again disruption the impacts in the risks of disruption. We've done a very good job of rebuilding the model we believe, we pivoted to the enterprise, and that's doing very well. And you want to continue to drive those higher margins. And we are going to look at everything we can to achieve our results are better. But I think you have to be very careful to avoid disruption and I think some people seeing that recently, some others have seen that. And so I think that's part of the issue, because that's going to be very damaging both short and long term. Michael Turitz : Okay, thanks. Andrew Del Matto : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski : All right. Thanks for taking the question. So your product revenues remain well above your peers, even today Check Point called out strength in the small and mid-market, yet they only had 2.9% growth in product revenue this quarter, and obviously Palo Alto seeing some product revenue to decline? So can you just give us any color on us to what drove of the strength in your product revenue this quarter, and then kind of what you are expecting that to stay at through FY 2017 for based on your new guidance? Ken Xie : Yes, I think some of the new product like whether the e-model and also some high-end product offer to the big enterprise service provider is to help drive the growth. And also we have a quite big installation base, I think based on IDC probably like more than 25% total global installed deploy [ph] base is a Fortinet ForitGate solution there. So that's also having - keep in driving and we also keeping refresh the product, which like - said earlier like every few years, customer also need to refresh product to get a better performance more function that also helping to drive with product growth. And then the service also, because the new products offer additional function, additional service that's also kind of helping to drive the long-term service growth. Andrew Nowinski : Got it. And then what level you're expecting for the remainder of 2017, and keeping in this high-single-digit? Andrew Del Matto : Yes. We don't - unfortunately we don't guide on product revenue, Andrew. There is the one thing I would mention is there, we try to - I think we were try to be helpful with the mix shift in Q3, and it was about - we thought about 200 to 300 basis points of product revenue is now reflected on the services line, if you think of it, it's being more software that's ratable, more metered model those appear on the services line. And then also with the enterprise bundle, you end up re-attributing through accounting more of the product up from the invoice on to the services deferred revenue and then amortizing over time. So do you measure that that's probably close to 500 bps that's really now that year-ago probably going to showing up on the product line, it's now showing up on the services line. Andrew Nowinski : Got it. Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : So big number, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Barclays. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Drew, I've got a philosophical question for you, maybe slightly different way of asking Mike Turitz' question earlier. But what factors went into updating the long-term model. We certainly appreciate the path and the milestone. But we're just - I was just wondering, is it something that - is it part of sort of a normal five-year planning type of process or what went to kind of thinking about profitability even beyond the original fiscal 20 target? Andrew Del Matto : Philosophically, we were just - I think it's the next stage of the company. If you go back a few years, we took down the margins really, because we wanted to build out an enterprise sales force and a broader go-to-market model so to speak, broader go-to-market model. That took some investment. And we refined it along the way. And we feel now as we've gone through a couple of quarters here, a year past, I think reorganizing if you will the sales force in the U.S. And we feel like we're doing very well. There is also - and we felt like the maturation of the model would then provide the benefits that we were hoping for all along. And we look at that obviously. We model it. We look at the vectors of that. Clearly, the mix shift on the gross margin line is helpful. Looking at productivity and you look at the natural ramp for it over time. Also, I mean, we received a lot of shareholder feedback to be frank. And we want to make sure that, one, we show we appreciate our shareholders' feedback. And we continually focus on creating - increasing shareholder value. So we appreciate everybody's feedback, that's very helpful. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough. Thanks very much, Drew. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the solid set of results. Drew, solid performance in the Americas. I know you guys don't break out the U.S. contribution within the slides. But can you provide us with some qualitative description of Fortinet's progress in the U.S. during the quarter, whatever color you can share with us? Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Yeah, the billings growth from the U.S. was very good. It was about 31%. And so, again, that's where we made a lot of the investments and whether you - when you look at that kind of near-term and longer-term that's - you get very comfortable that we start to get very comfortable with the productivity and improvements in the things we talked about in the rebuilding the go-to-market model and the refinements we made over time. It feels like the numbers indicate that that is going in the right direction. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is now open. Catharine Trebnick : Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. Mine is more on the service provider venue. It seems like a lot is the next generation implementations in their core networks will be NSE, SDN like. And what should the architecture that Fortinet has that would be most apt to go after that type of opportunity? Ken Xie : That were both on the new 7000 series, also with the new release, FortiOS 5.6, offer a lot out as a function, or lastly the SDN and Network Functions Virtualization. That's where we get a lot of our feedback from the service provider, from the cloud provider, the customer which we integrate into the - both the new hardware and also the new software. Andrew Del Matto : And then, Catharine, we constantly engage with our cloud and carrier team. And ask them what to expect. And they continually tell us that we're in all of the top careers. We're working with them on their architectures. And the breadth of portfolio, the Fabric matters and obviously, historically, performance matters. But we can help them, whether it's virtual or physical. And the other factor that we tend to see is just that whatever - they want to run their businesses inside out, so what they're sharing - what they're using or providing to their customers, they also want to run their systems on and run their business. And we feel like we're in those top prospects, they're forthcoming. Catharine Trebnick : Okay. Thanks, and I'll save some more up for the next call. Thank you, gentlemen. Kelly Blough : Thanks, Catharine. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. John Lucia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is John on for Erik. I was just looking at your headcount additions. It looked like you added 50 headcount per quarter over the last three quarters. It looks like the lowest level since 2011. So firstly, is this intentional or would you like to be adding more headcount in that. And then secondly, is increased attrition weighing on your headcount growth or has attrition remained constant over the last year? Andrew Del Matto : Erik, we evaluate the headcount based on the value they bring back to us. So again, we're doing a couple of things. We're trying to make sure we're covering the right opportunities, both from a customer perspective and then also from an R&D perspective and then the various other things we need to do to grow and scale the operations. But we're very focused on looking at the headcount requisitions that we open and they tie to that model, that they bring back an appropriate incremental return so that, one, that it makes sense term, but also long-term. Then, Ken, myself and as I said, Lisa, VP of HR, look at every hire that comes in the door from a resume perspective and what they're doing. And I think we just become increasingly focused on - we said several quarters ago. We're laser focused on productivity. And we continue to do that and we feel like that mode of operation. That process is working very well. John Lucia : So should we expect 50 going forward, 50 headcount additions going forward this quarter? Andrew Del Matto : Well, we really been guiding on operating margin, Erik. John Lucia : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Colville with Arete Research. Your line is now open. Patrick Colville : Thanks for taking the question. So the guidance implies for billings and revenue pretty steep sequential deceleration. Can you just help me understand what I might be missing? So that kind of manifests itself, because momentum is really strong. Andrew Del Matto : A couple of things, Patrick, one, clearly if you think about our business and now it's changed over time, first of all our SMB channel business is fine. It's very consistent and it's been doing very well. We've gone more into the enterprise. And what happens then is you now have inherently a more - I hate to use this word, but lumpiness to the business. And it just tends to be more pushed towards the end of the quarter. And so we're trying to do our best to adjust for any of that in terms of timing and take that all into account. And any given quarter you can get one or two large deals that can dramatically influence the results. And for instance, this quarter we had the university, the deal that we spoke about earlier, the $12 million - they'll be slightly north of $12 million. And so that can happen. We're just trying to take all those things into account when we look at it. Patrick Colville : Okay. Great. Thanks. Nice work. Andrew Del Matto : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is now open. Fatima Boolani : Hi, thank you for taking the question. Drew, just wanted to double click on the comments you made around productivity. It's very evident in the results that the changes you've made and the investments you've made have been paying off. But I'm curious if you can maybe qualitatively talk about sales force tenure and attrition levels, especially as we've now anniversaried Patricia's changes in North America. So any qualitative color around that would be very helpful. Thank you. Andrew Del Matto : Yes, I think we've done a - Fatima, it feels like we've done a great job of hiring the right people to approach the enterprise. And so, that's worked well. We don't - typically, aren't going to share exact tenure statistics, but I would say that statistic has improved since Q3 I think when we did share some. So we feel like we're better positioned and we're seeing that more consistent performance over time. And I really think that's the key driver, just getting people in the C getting them trained and the consistent performance. Ken Xie : Yes, also the marketing side also has and starting helping contribute in the result. And then also we offer probably the best training and the biggest training program in the industry. That's where both on the customer and the partner. And also even our own sales force side also was starting benefit from other - the training program we did. Fatima Boolani : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. It comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Mike on behalf of Tal. So billings growth rate was solid this quarter, up 22%. But your guidance is calling for deceleration to about 15% in the second quarter. Can you give us little color on any other areas in your - or what are the areas in your pipeline are contributing to some of that deceleration? Thanks. Andrew Del Matto : Hi, Mike. Fatima asked a similar question just a minute ago. So let me repeat what I said and then maybe add a little bit on to that. There are various elements or parts of our business, if you will, dimensions. And so think of this SMB as being a fairly consistent flow of business, and so, that one tends to be a little easier to predict if you will. We've been more focused on the enterprise. We've been very successful there. We're seeing the uptick in larger deals. What goes along with that though is it tends to be more of the deals falling into quarter end, closer to quarter, as enterprises are very good at pushing you to that to get the best deal. And so that timing, the lumpiness and timing that goes along with that are really addressed in how we guide. We're thinking about that very closely as we guide. What I would say, there was a larger deal that we mentioned during the quarter and I think if you adjust for that a little bit and you come off of - you'll come into a more what I would probably consider a historical sequential range for us from Q1 into Q2. And hopefully, that's helpful, Mike. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Andrew Del Matto : Yeah. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Kelly Blough for closing remarks. Kelly Blough : Thank you, everyone. I'm sorry we couldn't get to a couple of questions. Please do call in again at 3 :30 for our next phone call. Thank you. We'll talk to you then. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

You join the Fortinet Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Announcement. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Kelly Blough. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Kelly Blough : Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us this afternoon to discuss Fortinet\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2017. With me today are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Drew Del Matto, Fortinet\u2019s CFO. Ken will begin our call by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Drew will then review our financial and operating results, and conclude with our forward guidance before opening up the call for questions. During Q&A, we ask that you please be conscious of limited time on this call, and make your questions brief to allow for others to participate. As a reminder, today we\u2019re holding two calls. For those who have additional questions, we will hold a second conference call at 3 :30 pm Pacific Time. Both calls will be webcast from our investor relations website.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular the risk factors on our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of this date and we undertake no obligation, and specifically disclaim any obligation, to update our forward-looking statements.

A replay of this call will also be available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thank you, Kelly, and thanks to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to discuss our second quarter 2017 results. In the second quarter, Fortinet again demonstrated strong leadership in the security market. We continue to grow revenue and billings above the market rates. Ongoing strength in subscription services is creating high-margin recurring revenue, and improving the predictability of our financial results. We are pleased that our operation margin and earnings per share well exceeded our guidance, and we remain committed to continued growth and operation margin improvement. The second quarter offered an important test of Fortinet\u2019s technology leadership, as businesses and organizations small and large were hit with multiple ransomware attacks. The Fortinet Security Fabric provided customers with proactive and comprehensive protection, stopping the spread of Wannacry and Peyta through multiple, integrated, and automated lines of defense. At the first line of defense, FortiMail detected the malware from infected links, and if attachments were downloaded, FortiSandbox stopped the malware from entering the network. FortiGate blocked pfishing attempts, and FortiClient detected malware coming into organizations from external devices. FortiSwitch and FortiAP quarantined infected hosts, and stopped the ransomware from connecting to and encrypting file servers. Finally, FortiAnalyzer and FortiSIEM enable customers to monitor these and other security risks and react to them in real time. Fortinet is taking the lead in providing actionable threat intelligence through the use of our new cloud-based Threat Intelligence Service. Fortinet is partnering with global intelligence organizations such as NATO, and Interpol to combat cybercrime. Recently, our collaboration with Interpol led to the identification and shut down of 8,800 Command and Control servers and compromised websites, including government portals. We are proud to announce that Fortinet was recognized as a Leader in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls. The report evaluated the completeness of Fortinet\u2019s Security Fabric vision and our ability to execute as factors for the inclusion in the Magic Quadrant. FortiGate Enterprise Firewall customers provided three times more reviews on Gartner Peer Insights than the nearest competitor. As a foundation of the Fortinet Security Fabric, the FortiGate Enterprise Firewall is the only solution that delivers the scale, automation, and performance needed to protect from the edge to the datacenter and from IoT to the Cloud. We also retained our status as a Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Unified Threat Management. For the eighth year in a row, Fortinet was recognized by Gartner for vision and ability to execute in the UTM category. Fortinet UTM technology reduces IT complexity for SMBs providing advanced protection, network performance, and unified visibility and control offered by the Fortinet Security Fabric. This innovative technology has made Fortinet the leading security provider and the largest market share holder in the UTM space. Additionally, IDC again named Fortinet the unit market share leader for security appliances shipped. In the second quarter, Fortinet demonstrated commitment to the leadership in cloud security. In April, we announced extension of the Fortinet Security Fabric to the cloud as part of our FortiOS 5.6 release. We also launched FortiCASB, extending the core capabilities of our Security Fabric architecture to provide businesses the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence in cloud environments as they do on their physical networks. And we enhanced FortiGate SD-WAN capabilities to enable distributed enterprises to apply Security Fabric visibility and control to their software-defined environments. During the second quarter, Fortinet expanded cloud security capabilities for Microsoft Azure and AWS customers. While many of our competitors are talking about their cloud solutions, the Fortinet Security Fabric delivers performance, effective security, and management across private and public cloud environments. More leading technology companies joined the Fortinet Security Fabric-Ready ecosystem in the second quarter. Microsoft joined the Fabric-Ready program to be able to deliver cloud security at scale for global enterprise corporations. To-date, Fortinet has 27 Fabric-Ready Program Partners, representing a cross-section of leading information technology providers including Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whose offerings can integrate with the Fortinet Security Fabric. Fortinet offers the most open program in the market today, even allowing competitor products to integrate with the Fortinet Security Fabric. Our open approach offers customers the management, visibility and control benefits of the Fortinet Security Fabric within their existing environments, whether on-premise, in private clouds or in the public cloud. Fortinet is proud of the recognition by industry analysts of our market leadership and positioning in the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewall and Unified Threat Management. We remain committed to maintaining this leadership position by investing in growth while making continued progress toward our profitability goals. I will now turn the call to Drew to review our second quarter financial results and forward guidance. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. Let me now share our financial results for the second quarter, which can be seen on slide three. Fortinet had another strong quarter. Billings increased 14% year-over-year to $427 million. Revenue of $363 million dollars was up 17% year-over-year. Deferred revenue grew to $1,161 million, up 28% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing business shift to more margin-rich, recurring subscription and service revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 75%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.27. We generated free cash flow of $58 million during the quarter, an increase over the same period last year in spite of the impact of the $85 million purchase in April of the two buildings in the Vancouver area. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $145 million, an increase of 113% year-over-year. We had another good quarter in large enterprise deals. Year-over-year, the number of deals over $100,000 grew 21%, deals over $250,000 grew 5%, deals over $500,000 grew 10%, and deals over $1 million grew 25%. The majority of our large deals were attributable to the key differentiators of the Fabric, particularly manageability, orchestration, and integration across the enterprise. We again had a strong quarter in the government vertical, and we made some significant strides in the U.S. Federal space. Two of our seven-figure deals in the quarter were Fabric deals with U.S. government organizations. The breakdown of billings across our top five verticals was Service Provider at 18%; Government at 15%; Financial Services at 13%; Education at 10%; and Retail at 8%. On a geographic basis, billings in the Americas grew 13%, EMEA billings grew 13%, and APAC billings grew 19%. North America again had a strong billings quarter, lending us continued confidence in the maturation of our sales model. Now, turning to billings by product range on slide four. High-end products accounted for 39% of total product billings, our mid-range products accounted for 29%, and our entry-level products accounted for 32%. Revenue was $363 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. As you can see on slide five, revenue performance was driven by the combination of 4% year-over-year product revenue growth, and 26% year-over-year services revenue growth. The continued shift to higher services growth reflects our ongoing success in driving higher priced subscription bundles, metered model cloud business, and virtual solutions. Global revenue diversification is a key strength of our business. Turning to slides six and seven, revenue from the Americas represented 44% of our business and grew 21% year-over-year; revenue from EMEA represented 36% of our business and grew 13% year-over-year; and revenue from APAC represented 20% of our business and grew 14% year-over-year. During the second quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin was 75%. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 85%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 58%, lower than recent quarters due to inventory reserves as we transition to our newer appliances. We continue to focus on productivity and efficiency in our operating model, paying close attention to the growth in billings versus operating expenses. On a year-over-year basis, in the second quarter, billings grew by 14%, while sales and marketing expense grew by just 1%. In all, we had $53 million in incremental billings year-over-year, on just $12 million in incremental operating expense. As a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 40%, down from 46% in the second quarter of last year; research and development expenses were 12%, flat from last year; and general and administrative expenses were 5%, up 1% from last year due to the ongoing implementation costs of the new revenue accounting standard. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $206 million during the quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $66 million, or 18% of total revenue, up 600 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $48 million or $0.27 per share, based on approximately 180 million diluted shares outstanding. As expected, the annualized non-GAAP tax rate was 32%. As seen on slides eight and nine, we again ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $1,465 million in cash and investments. During the quarter, we spent $33 million to repurchase 849,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $39.07. As I mentioned earlier, cash from operations was $145 million, representing growth of 113% over the same period last year, and free cash flow in the quarter was $58 million. Annualized inventory turns for Q2 were 2.2, an improvement over inventory turns of 1.6 in the first quarter of this year. Deferred revenue increased to $1,161 million, an increase of $257 million or 28% year-over-year. DSO was 68 days, down from 74 days in the second quarter of 2016. Let me now finish with our guidance, which can be seen on slide 10. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements, including all of the guidance statements provided, are subject to Kelly\u2019s cautions at the start of this call. Our business is more heavily weighted toward international markets than most of our competitors, and as such we are cautious that slower summer months, particularly in Europe, can sequentially affect our business, particularly when it comes to larger deals where more signatures are needed. With this is mind, for the third quarter of 2017, we expect billings in the range of $417 million to $427 million; revenue in the range of $367 million to $373 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75%. We are pleased with the margin performance that we had in the second quarter, but are mindful that some of the profitability improvement came from not hiring as quickly as we had planned. For the third quarter we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 16% to 17%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.22 to $0.23. We are revising our guidance for the full year 2017, which is billings in the range of $1,775 million to $1,795 million; revenue in the range of $1,487 million to $1,495 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 74.5% to 75%; non-GAAP operating margin of 16.2%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $0.96. Additionally, the Board of Directors doubled our authorization for share repurchases to $600 million through January of 2019. We expect to repurchase at least $150 million worth of stock in 2017, including the $33 million that we spent in the second quarter. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Ken to close. Ken Xie : Thank you, Drew. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and with the leadership that Fortinet is demonstrating in the market today. The Fortinet Security Fabric offers us a unique and strong competitive position, and we are gaining market share against our competitors and mindshare with customers around the world. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank Fortinet employees, partners, customers, and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Kelly Blough : Operator, you could start the Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Owens of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please? Rob Owens : Thanks for taking my question, guys. First off, EMEA\u2019s [ph] proven to be kind of a wildcard for a lot of people this quarter. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing over there, ahead of GDPR and the mandate? And it looked like performance from a billings perspective is kind of in line with what you saw here in the U.S. So, just was curious to get additional color. Drew Del Matto : Sure, Rob; it\u2019s Drew. I think for GDPR, we view it really as early stage. And most of what seems to be focused -- customers seem to be focused on at this point is privacy, and that\u2019s really getting the various sector agreements in place with their customers or client base, if you will, and then focus on complying with those rules. And then I think what comes next is the security and compliance piece of that, where they are looking to make sure that they have the appropriate security along with the privacy and then the compliance of course, because there is signs [ph] all the reporting requirements. And that part we think is early stage. They probably want to focus on the privacy at this point, and ultimately security and compliance piece really becomes about architecture and visibility, if you will. And that is something that we think is going to happen. It just hasn\u2019t been a catalyst yet. Ken Xie : Yes. And just to add a few points as well. We see the GDPR as generally positive because they drive a lot of internal security segmentations and that\u2019s the -- the Fortinet Fabric story is feeding quite well. And also the additional reporting and administration that\u2019s also a benefit for the security provider. The only downside is they may take a longer time to making foreign decisions. So that we see, maybe delay some of the deal but in general it\u2019s very positive for the space. Rob Owens : And for an unrelated follow-up. You didn\u2019t speak to your longer term margin guidance that you gave last quarter of that 150, 200 basis points once we get beyond this year, and curious if you are sticking to that. And any sense for an impact of 606 on 2018 and beyond, how that margin could play out? Thanks. Drew Del Matto : Yes. We are sticking to the 150, 200 and the 25% by 2022, Rob, no change there. We are sticking to what we said last quarter, absolutely committed. Kelly Blough : Yes, 606. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Kelly. Yes, we are still evaluating that. I think on the revenue side from a product, I mean it looks we\u2019ll be on the model similar to most of the people in space, which I think we are still on our product, upfront product model, the services of course will be amortized ratably. So, we haven\u2019t quantified the change, but I think it\u2019s similar to what you are seeing in space. The commissions, the product piece will be immediately expensed in the quarter, the upfront piece and then the services will be amortized over that time. And as you know, just one thing to note, 2017, this is one question we think we\u2019ll get is, 2017 is our baseline for the 150 to 200 points of margin premium annually and the 25% by 2022. So, as that adjusts the baseline, then we will go from there with the 150 to 200 basis points beyond. But it\u2019s 150 to 200 basis points from the base line which was 2017; if that adjusts, the baseline adjusts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Melissa Gorham of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please? Melissa Gorham : Drew, it looks like the billings in the quarter was a little bit light of your midpoint in terms of the guidance for Q2 but your commentary was fairly positive and it looks like you are slightly raising the full year billings guide. So, was there anything that came in below your expectations and what gives you confidence that billings growth can accelerate in the second half of the year? Drew Del Matto : Yes. I mean, we\u2019re roughly in line with expectations, to be fair, Melissa. I think the story of the quarter is that a lot of enterprises are looking at the architecture, the Fabric plays extremely well as we continue the theme of consolidation and customers to look, to buy more functionality in subscriptions and bundles. And we think that plays favorably for us. It\u2019s always hard to call exactly where any given quarter\u2019s going to end. But I think going forward, we feel like we\u2019re getting a lot of inbound opportunities; our funnel looks good. The Magic Quadrant; we believe helps the fact that we\u2019re in the leadership quadrant, the Magic Quadrant on Next-Gen Firewall. And we believe those things create great opportunity for us, along with things like GDPR. Ken Xie : Also the service provider side, we see a little bit, takes maybe long time to make some decision. But we do have a lot of test and evaluation going on. So that\u2019s contributed some of the building softening in the Q2. On other side, we see very strong enterprise growing and especially the Leader in the Enterprise Firewall, Magic Quadrant from Gartner, I think that will help a lot and we see a lot of potential in enterprise sector. Melissa Gorham : Okay. Yes. And my follow-up question was just going to be on the service provider space, because it did seem like that was a weak vertical for you guys this quarter. So, was there some deals that slipped in Q2 and you\u2019re expecting that\u2019s going to close in Q3 or is there any expectation of material rebound in that vertical in your guidance? Drew Del Matto : Yes. Melissa, we continue to be in evaluation mode with the service providers. We feel like we\u2019re making good progress with them and we continue to be a strong player in the space. What we\u2019re seeing is, I think it\u2019s fair to say, they\u2019re more focused on their cash flow, their free cash flow and they do more pay-as-you-go models. And I think that\u2019s a shift in their business, which means pay-as-you-go basically meaning buy as they need versus buying a large chunk. So, we\u2019ve seen I think some of that quite frankly. Ken Xie : Yes. The other part is really as some of the service providers starting to have some overlay with certain cloud provider. So that\u2019s also we kind of are starting more focus on the cloud side like in my script, I mentioned, the new cloud initiative, the leadership we have in cloud both on portal and the service side. So, we\u2019re also starting to consider service provider and cloud provider together. And that\u2019s I think overall, if we combine the cloud and the traditional service provider together, the space in service provider, see whatever positive. Kelly Blough : Melissa, to get your question on our expectations, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we don\u2019t have really high expectations for that segment of the business for the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please? Gabriela Borges : I\u2019d love to get a little more color on the commentary on international markets in the guidance. Maybe Ken or Drew, you could comment on whether you\u2019ve already started to see a slowdown in Europe that looks different from what you would typically see to the summer? And as I think about the larger deals potentially taking longer to close, are you already seeing that or is that more just the deals in the pipeline are getting bigger and by default they would take longer to close? Drew Del Matto : Gabriela, it\u2019s Drew. Just we\u2019ll start from the top of the geographies. So, I think Asia, especially South Asia did I think extremely well, we don\u2019t see -- we continue to see good opportunities there, we saw that last quarter. I think the U.S. in particular has looked good. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments there. The enterprise part of the business is doing really well. We see uptake in the Fabric, the number of Fabric deals and multi-product deals and multi-product customers and penetrating further into our install based. And that\u2019s part of the story, I think primarily certainly in North America and especially in the U.S. If you get into Europe, the GDPR piece of it is a little hard to call. I don\u2019t think we would say that that caused -- that had an impact on our results. I do think it\u2019s fair to say that customers clearly are focused on it, and it\u2019s hard to predict how they will behave, I think in the coming months. Gabriela Borges : That\u2019s helpful color. And just as a quick follow-up, Drew. Any commentary on duration? We\u2019ve seen a pretty consistent trend towards the longer term deferred revenue, which come -- kind of how we would imagine with enterprises engaging more on a strategic basis over the longer period of time. But any additional color would be great there. Drew Del Matto : Yes, that\u2019s it. I mean, at the end of the day, the longer term deals are generally enterprise customers and it reflects their longer term commitment to the products and the Security Fabric, Fortinet Security Fabric. Clearly, the focus on the enterprise is paying off and that\u2019s result of it. It did, I think it was roughly flat duration, roughly flat with last quarter, sub 24 months, is that right? Yes, about 24 months about flat, Gabriela. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. I guess question just, Ken, it sounds like you\u2019re quite pleased with the performance the Fabric deals are up-ticking. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about any sort of metrics around -- we\u2019ve sort of gotten used of modeling attach and looking at sources attaching the product. Products seem slowing down, it sounds like you\u2019re seeing maybe uptick in attach or customers that are doing more of these Fabric deal that will drive more substitution over the long-term despite some slowdown in product. Any color you can give us around how to think about, maybe how that\u2019s trending now versus in the past? Ken Xie : Yes, we definitely see the non FortiGate [ph] which part of the Fabric also grow faster. And also the Fabric including the cloud, including endpoint and that\u2019s where the FortiClient and also the cloud offering and some other like AP and also need a lot of surveys and also some other emails, switch, FortiMail, FortiSwitch. So, all this actually drives overall growth and also the potential markets much bigger. But also we need to train ourselves, train the partner, it\u2019s beyond the traditional firewall, general fire, it\u2019s also including how to cover the mobile device like the example I gave, how to protect the ransomware just like a four, five line of defense. And so that\u2019s all kind of looking to help customer to stop all the ransomware there. So, we see the growth of the Fabric Solutions at much faster and but also take some time, because some part of the Fabric is really the software as a service; that\u2019s also probably helping contribute, I don\u2019t know the percentage. Drew Del Matto : That\u2019s right. There is a mix shift I think as us and others in the space have been seeing, I think consolidation is part of it. Clearly the Fabric and the facts that we are doing multi-product deals contribute to that along with selling more virtual products, even the longer term deals as we have discussed before has an impact on how you recognize the upfront versus how much you defer, late on the deferred side. And then the emerging products are doing very well. That\u2019s one area that are doing really well. And again there is the virtual products in that cloud and those again tend to weigh on the favor of the services line, if you will. So those things, those elements are driving the mix shift. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open. Jayson Noland : Great, thank you. I wanted to ask on cloud service provider, maybe an update on this category independently of telco service provider pipeline and visibility? Ken Xie : I think if we see the call service provider are mostly public, also some private starting growing quite well, that\u2019s where even some traditional telecom service providers also starting tap in cloud space. And also when we offer the Fabric, the customers need both solutions on-premise in the physical format, also some in the cloud, so they can have the flexibility. So that\u2019s where -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re just done yet, but we do see the cloud side grow faster on a still relatively smaller base. I think for the long-term service providers region because the cloud, the mobile can play some of the business but on other side like last quarter, the ransomware, some other attack still get into the company network side. That\u2019s where we feel that the Fabric, so they can offer a combination of a physical, on-premise combined with cloud how to protect the cloud, the mobile is also kind of important. So, we see this kind of the overall infrastructure security starting replacing some of the traditional network only security. Jayson Noland : And these are high-end deals typically, Ken, large deals? Ken Xie : Yes, the Fabric tend to be working well for the big customers, big enterprise. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your question, please? Jonathan Ho : Good afternoon. Just wanted to start out with the competitive environment, whether you are seeing any changes out there or any competitors getting little bit more aggressive in terms of the network security area? Ken Xie : We have a more broad offering and also the price performance also as a better leadership in the space. So, we don\u2019t see much in the competitive space, and also we are taking share from competitors right now. Drew Del Matto : Yes. I mean, Jonathan, we are really selling on value, the value of the Fabric, the integration, the management capabilities, the orchestration and visibility that\u2019s required. If you think about GDPR for instance, it\u2019s a spot on. And I think that\u2019s the case in the enterprises. And we are still successful there and it\u2019s because we are selling the value. And so, we don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we necessarily feel all the pressures that the other competitors see in the space. And we feel like we are certainly doing a good job of taking share. Jonathan Ho : Got it. And then, can you talk a little bit about the ransomware attacks and purchasing behavior by the customers? Are you actually seeing that accelerate purchase behavior or is it actually delaying? We\u2019ve heard both from various competitors. Ken Xie : Actually the real damage, probably a little bit smaller compared to some other like what happened in the past. But the media definitely gave a much bigger coverage of the ransomware and also the customers also want to know how to protect. That\u2019s where we offer multiple line defense and from the FortiMail side to stop the email, which has a bad content or link attachment and then to the FortiGate which stop all the network site, and then the FortiClient and then FortiSandbox working with FortiSwitch, FortiAP, which also can quarantine the infected host. And then in end also the analyzer FortiSIEM can also give the monitor and real time react. I think overall, it\u2019 really hard to do the infrastructure protection compared to the traditional protect a few point on our side. So that\u2019s where -- once the customer\u2019s been educated about how to protect the infrastructure, which also including traditional side and also cover the mobile and the cloud, they definitely sync in the Security Fabric story much better and much advance, the new generation compared to the traditional Next Generation Firewall security. So that\u2019s where we get a lot of customers, especially big enterprise customers starting, interesting all this Security Fabric story. And so, not also like the Gartner Magic Quadrant also helps a lot and that\u2019s also will be potentially a big potential for us to keeping -- grow more in the enterprise environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : I wondered if you could characterize the competitive dynamics and your win rates in the two ends of the spectrum in terms of markets. So, in other words, what are you seeing in the low-end? I think Palo Alto has a new PA-200. And any change in the competitive dynamics there? And what are you seeing, if you characterize your win rates in the enterprise over this quarter versus what you\u2019ve seen? Ken Xie : In the low-end, we continue leading. And I think based on some ADC data, they have Q1 data on the ADC tracker. We grow like 12.4% compared to a year ago, all the other competitors probably less than 10%. So, we\u2019re keeping gaining share there. At the same time, the unit shipment we probably more than doubled the number -- number to number some other competitor. And we already lead in the market probably like, every -- we say, every like one of a four box deployed globally is a Fortinet box, FortiGate box. So, we already have pretty big market share on the total unit deployed. It\u2019s more because some of the technology we have in the SMB, we have System-on-a-Chip, we call a security processor System-on-a-Chip, which can use a single chip to offer the whole system compared to some other competitor have to lower software in some PC server there. So, it\u2019s a huge advantage on the price performance. So, we keep leading there, we keep gaining shares and we feel we are very strong and we don\u2019t see any competitor come close or threaten our provision on the growth in the SMB. On the enterprise, we tend to a little bit behind, but now we see the momentum is very healthy and we\u2019re gaining a lot of momentum, market share and also with the help of the Magic Quadrant leadership there, that also will open a lot of doors and lot of deals we start seeing come in and starting to get some interest from customers now. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then one follow-up for Drew. So, look at the guidance for next quarter, specifically to revenue, I\u2019m just curious if there is anything that you\u2019re looking at a little bit different in terms of mix, the product versus subscription or linearity or anything else? Just want to make sure I understand how you kind of build the revenue guide for next quarter, given the billings guidance that you have and the billings results in the quarter. Drew Del Matto : Sure, Sterling. No, we haven\u2019t really changed anything. I think as you get more quarters of mix shift, certainly want to reflect that and how you think about the forward revenue. And I\u2019d say that\u2019s what we\u2019re taking into account. It\u2019s just -- I think it\u2019s hard to predict what the product side will be; it\u2019s also hard to predict how much virtual versus kind of traditional hardware, if you will, and then even the tenure of the deals and types of things that impact the accounting. So, what we\u2019re doing is kind of estimating continued -- believe there is probably still a continued mix shift and we just wait more on that going forward. Kelly Blough : And I\u2019d like to just remind everyone, we\u2019ve got eight or nine people lined up for questions. So, if you keep it to one question and then call back at 3 :30 that would be great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thanks very much and of course I get the one question rule imposed. I did want to ask -- it\u2019s okay. I did want to ask about cash flow and specifically your working capital cycle. Your day cycle on cash flow this quarter was an improvement down the call to 113 days from 131 days, but it\u2019s still almost double what Palo Alto\u2019s cash flow cycle is, the days cycle. Is there a structural reason why your cash cycle is so much worse than one of your key competitors? And what would it take to improve that? And then just finally, if you could just update us on your real estate aspirations or what you tend to spend on real estate versus your last comments? Thank you. Drew Del Matto : Sure. I\u2019ll let you get away with two questions. Look, I think what\u2019s different in the model is we have inventory, I\u2019m not sure that Palo has a lot of inventory. And I think that obviously consumes cash and I think -- I haven\u2019t seen the math, how you got to your numbers. But if you think it\u2019s just traditional cash conversion cycle, inventory would be a huge component of that. Our DSO at 68 is better than last year. I mean, I would say we have been focused on cash conversion cycle, but probably the biggest impact is the inventory turns going after 2.2 from 1.6 last quarter. But, the big difference in the model would be the inventory. As far as the real estate goes, we\u2019re through the Vancouver area billings. So, we paid for that in April. That\u2019s reflected in the $58 million of free cash flow we have this quarter, which in a good way, was even better than a year ago, I think, with that big chunk. So, we feel good about that. And operating cash flow was up I think a 113% as well. So, felt pretty good. Now, going forward, again, we\u2019ve guided I think $150 million of CapEx for the year, $120 million of that is real estate related. I think we\u2019re through\u2026 Kelly Blough : 95 of that. Drew Del Matto : 95 or so of that. So, we have a bit to go. We\u2019ll stick to that certainly for now. And then, in the next couple of years, we said about $60 million each year to build out our headquarter location on property that we basically own. So, rather than go buy building, we own the property. So, we\u2019re going to build here, keep our employees centrally located where they are. They are less at risk; that\u2019s one of the reasons we did -- one of the key reasons for being in the Vancouver area properties is the location and it just appeals to our employees. Keith Bachman : All right. Thanks very much. Drew Del Matto : You\u2019re welcome. Ken Xie : On the working capital, we have a much more broader product and also the lower end, actually you look at the unit shipment, we\u2019re probably like a [indiscernible] on the unit shipments, because a lot of lower entities, manufacturing some other remote location and they are taking -- shipping by ocean that will take long time because we try to measure the total cost with opportunity cost which is -- you cannot ship in backlog and also the shipping cost, shipping by ocean and also the other capital cost, working capital. So we have a pretty good model [indiscernible] this is different cost and therefore the best combination. So, we feel the model really helping us improving the margin a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your question, please? Fatima Boolani : Thanks for taking the question. Drew, a question for you. The retail vertical, just from a macro perspective, in a secular routine and you have been able to keep the mix of your billings tied to that vertical pretty stable. I am just wondering what the puts and takes for you are there, just given the anemic overall health of that vertical? Drew Del Matto : Yes. Our value preposition is very strong and I think this is really -- again, much of it is distributed enterprise type of situation and hospitality is in there too, and certainly that sector is doing fine. And there are other distributed enterprise types of situations that go on. And so, our Fabric is very strong and we have always sold a lot of units into that enterprise. And I think just from a value perspective our success in that business reflects the value proposition. Fatima Boolani : If I could sneak another quick one in on the education vertical, any large deals around the WiFi opportunity with respect to E-Rate program that are relevant to call out given your strength there in that vertical? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Ken Xie : I think we try to combine the WiFi and security together and customers see big value mandate together using 40k. [Ph] So, we see also both in education and some other vertical space, they structure the benefit of a combined WiFi security. Not quite related to E-Rate, which is probably only focused on WiFi but really when we consider the security and the WiFi together like infrastructure security, we have a huge advantage benefit and also even cost savings for the customers for the total IT security solution. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ken Talanian : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, you noted that you didn\u2019t hire as quickly as planned. And I was curious, was that mostly a result of greater scrutiny during the hiring process or more difficulty in actually finding the right talent? Ken Xie : The hiring environment actually is improving because some of competitors compared to like one to two years ago, some companies hiring like crazy, now is -- we do see more candidates and also a lot of competitors. We also kind of pretty carefully evaluate the hiring and also because early in the year, we also try to see how the business is going. We kind of -- but I think overall hiring environment is improving. We see more candidates come in, but on the other side, we also tend to be more careful selecting the candidates. Ken Talanian : Thank you. Ken Xie : We hope we\u2019ll catch up some of the hiring, we kind of -- in the first half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turitz of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turitz : I wanted to go back Jonathan Ho\u2019s question, where he asked, if ransomware had actually caused any delays in spending. And therefore, given the slight weakness in billings, if I really had to factor down, might have had negative influence. Was it delays around ransomware, delays around GDPR? I know you listed service provider a little weak, and was there anything else? Ken Xie : No, I did not delay on the ransomware. Ransomware is helping driving awareness of the importance of security. And also, we try to educate customer to protect the ransomware attack, you need to have the infrastructure approach and not just only network approach. So that\u2019s where the multiple, and defense will be much better solution. On the other side, we do see the GDPR I think still positive but it may take the decision maybe longer. The service provider kind of a little bit different story, because some service providers, maybe evaluate the business model like a CapEx model, OpEx model; some other more relay to how to transition the cloud, how to offer in mobile protection. So, thus tend to do a lot of testing, evaluation, but not quite making a decision yet. Michael Turitz : Okay. And anything else that we should think of as possibly having to do billings in the quarter? Ken Xie : The enterprise is more positive and also we see a big potential going forward. Drew Del Matto : Enterprise has been really good, Michael. Obviously, it\u2019s good news. The leadership quadrant on the Next-Gen Firewall from Gartner is obviously important. Ken Xie : The Fabric, we see customer running like a lot, because you\u2019d have a too many different vendors to work with. And also we called a Fabric-Ready program, which we have the bigger networking companies, the software companies Microsoft, there is also like HP server, some other. There are a lot of companies we are starting working together to making the management of security IT more-easy and customer, lot of bigger enterprise like this a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz : A bit of a follow-up to Michael\u2019s question. You did well in seven-figure deal activity this quarter. Although the growth in the number of deals in the bands between 250k and 500k as well as between 500k and a 1 million slowed fairly significant this quarter and aside from perhaps what you noted in service provider and possibly slightly with GDPR as well. Just wondering, if there is anything else that you would kind of attribute some of the deceleration within those bands? Drew Del Matto : No, Michael. There is nothing really to point out there. I think that\u2019s just the way the deals came in this quarter. Gregg Moskowitz : And then maybe just a quick follow-up. So, what has -- I guess the question is for Ken. What has the response been so far to your new appliance models, specifically 70-60 E and the 39-80 E? Thanks. Ken Xie : We see [indiscernible] 7,000 and lot of evaluation and actually both in the enterprise and also the service provider, because they have the best performance and the Next-Gen Firewall and other part. But as you know the bigger units usually take a longer time to sell and especially some bigger enterprise service provider, which sometime may take one to two year, but we see the interest is high. We also transitioned some of the D model to E model in the low end and we also see the transition doing well. We do make a little bit reserve on the inventory as Drew said. But so far, the new model, both in the high-end 7,000 and 3,000, also the low end like 60 D to 60 E, we see a lot of good transition right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your question, please? Shaul Eyal : Question also with respect to the progress you have shown on the high end appliances this quarter of 39% of revenues. Is the large $12 million contract that was announced in the first quarter had any impact this quarter also on high end appliances? Drew Del Matto : No, Shaul, no. That was last quarter. I believe we took that last quarter. Yes. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s it on my end. Thank you. Ken Xie : I think the 7,000 also will help in the bigger deal a little bit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Arete Research. Your question, please? Patrick Colville : Thanks for taking my question. So, just circling back from high level, product growth little bit slower than the recent trajectory. Is anything specific there, was that just kind of boarder slowdown that we\u2019ve seen Palo Alto and Check Point, maybe the initial impact, just any kind of virtual firewalls? Ken Xie : We don\u2019t see much slowdown. Actually, I think when they enter some bigger deal or long-term deal, the way they calculate which part of the product or which part of the service may have a few impact -- maybe I don\u2019t know, a couple percentage impact assumption\u2026 Drew Del Matto : I think the way to think about it is, customers continue to buy the Fabric, which includes emerging products which are growing very well, it includes virtual products, cloud, a variety of things. As Ken said, some of that gets recognized on the services line, which I think to your question, Patrick, it is something that we\u2019re seeing across the industry. From our perspective, there tends to be -- there is a continued theme of consolidation. Customers have too many security devices they are looking to consolidate. A lot of that we do through enriched subscription bundles that we charge more for and they\u2019re higher priced -- higher priced obviously, higher margin over time but they get reflected over time. We think actually the fact that on the leadership quadrant, Gartner Magic Quadrant on Next-Gen Firewalls reflects the visionary part of the Fabric, if you will, the vision that actually plays to those things. Patrick Colville : And can I just ask a quick follow-up, just on the guidance, kind of second on the year. You guys are looking for acceleration in the billings. Can you just remind us the good reasons for that please? Drew Del Matto : Q3 of last year was -- generally Q3 to Q2 is flattish in the absolute dollars, roughly flat, let\u2019s say, could be plus or minus a couple percentage points. I think over time it\u2019s about average, about the same, flat. Last Q3 was a challenging quarter. And so, there was a dip from Q2 to Q3. And so, the growth there I think probably explains most of that, if not all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. I\u2019ll keep it to one. Drew, can you just talk about product gross margin a little bit? I know you mentioned somewhat was related to the inventory write-down; we certainly understand that. But can you talk about how gross margins maybe look excluding that? I guess I just want to dig into maybe how the discounting environment maybe compared to prior quarters? Drew Del Matto : Well, look, I think the margins look fine; our pricing remains competitive, Saket. We certainly feel like we are holding price and discounting seems flat. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike Feldman : Hi, guys. This is Mike Feldman on for Tal Liani. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one, financial vertical\u2019s been strong for last few quarters. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving the strength there and if you could talk about the competitive landscape in that vertical? Thank you. Drew Del Matto : Again, I think we just -- our products hit the spot on financial services. Performance has always been a key requirement for that space along with excellence in security, and we provide both of those things. I think our vision is outstanding as reflected in our leadership in the Magic Quadrant as we have been talking about. Again, they are looking to consolidate. We are able to provide that and deliver the performance. The management, the orchestration and the visibility that they need to run their security operations and do it effectively and efficiently, and that\u2019s why it resonates there, and we are doing very well in that vertical. Ken Xie : Yes. Also finance sector, they are more leading on the internal segmentation and also they lag the infrastructure security including a WiFi together with networking side, especially the branch office. So, we see -- we have a huge advantage compared to all the other competitors with the infrastructure security, with WiFi together with networking security and also with also the security Fabric and internal segmentation. I think that\u2019s all helping and gaining the share in the finance sector. I think the Magic Quadrant we just got in this month in July that eventually will also help a lot because the finance sectors do consult this Gartner Magic Quadrant a lot. So that also helps us to gaining more market share there. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Blough for any closing remarks. Ma\u2019am? Kelly Blough : It looks like we\u2019ve got through all the questions with three minutes to spare. Thank you, everybody so much for dialing in. And we look forward to speaking with you again in about an hour, an hour and three minutes and please call back in for the second call. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am and thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude your second quarter 2017 earnings announcement. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fortinet Third Quarter Financial Analyst Q&A Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Kelly Blough, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Blough, the call is yours. Kelly Blough - Fortinet, Inc.: Thanks, Sherry. Thank you, everybody for dialing back in. I would like to remind everyone that the disclosures and cautionary language that I read at the beginning of the call at 1 : 30 today still applies to this call. We will be making forward-looking statements and all of those are subject to risks and uncertainties as outlined in our presentation online. This call is entirely Q&A, so I will turn the call back over to the operator to moderate that Q&A session, and we request, again, that you try to limit your questions to one at a time and then you can dial back in for more. Operator, you can go ahead and pool for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Jayson Noland with Baird. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the Fabric, it's come up a lot on the call today, and it's a term that's used widely across the industry, so I guess my question is, how do you differentiate relative to others? Is there a good way to do that in a proof-of-concept, or what's the best approach there? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. This is Ken. We have a more broad product to cover different applications than other vendors. That's where \u2013 we're also working on this for a long time in the last seven, eight years since the company started, like whether it's the Mail product, the FortiWeb product, the Client product, it's all in-house developed. On this product \u2013 actually when we develop the product, we also intend to make it working together with FortiGate which is the firewall, next-generation firewall UTM product. So all these kind of integrate well, and they can also \u2013 ease of the management. So we have the FortiSIEM, also one of the fastest growing in the last couple of quarter, which also help in manage all this together. So that's different than some other company they may have one or two products that are working together. We have much broader, not only that, but also the Access part, WiFi, like the networking part, like the cloud side, and also the endpoint and the IoT side. So all this tied together is the internal develop \u2013 the intent to make it working together from the beginning. So that's different than some other company, whether by acquisition or by some like mostly integrated product. So I think that's where we feel the Fabric start that we have is much better and work more tightly integrated better than the other vendors. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And maybe just a quick follow-up there, Ken. Is the pricing offer concessions for bundles or volume deals, be it an enterprise agreement or something similar? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Right now, the bundle more tied to different function. Yeah, the Enterprise that you'll have \u2013 to say in some enterprise they may even have like ELA, Enterprise Liable Agreement, so that's where we all were open for that and we are definitely working together to try to see, some time we may sell all this together, but right now it's still in the early stage. It's more like \u2013 the FortiGate is still leading a lot of our deal, so we learn is FortiGate first and then eventually expand into some other product, upsell, cross-sell, but going forward could be all bundled together. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anne Meisner with Susquehanna Financial. Anne M. Meisner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. So I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the product revenue growth. The Q4 guidance implied somewhat flattish growth and if I take this year's sort of sequential growth rates and I apply them to 2018, I basically also get flat growth. Now I know you're not guiding for 2018, so I'm not going to specifically ask you, but I was hoping you could just tell us kind of how you're thinking about the product revenue line longer-term? Because if you're running the business to maximize subscription revenue, which I would argue is probably the right thing to do anyways since it's profitable, it's recurring, not so volatile in the quarter. I guess you could ask yourself, does products really need to grow longer-term? Can it just stay flat? And then we'll let the services revenue line kind of pick up the slack in terms of driving the growth for the company? Is that one way to think about it? Because it wouldn't necessarily be a terrible thing if that's sort of what happens as long as the growth in services is it's more sustainable. But I guess the question is, if that's kind of the case, and that's how you're thinking about it, maybe it's better to just sort of message that a little better to the Street, so it's better understood? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Fair enough, Anne. I think what you're seeing, however, is it is what you said. We're definitely seeing a mix shift. As we do more enterprise business, as customers buy more of the non-FortiGate, they buy higher products, more content-rich bundles, and they buy higher level of service. And I think I've mentioned a couple of times now that they're buying more 7x24 than 5x8 for instance. But what happens along with \u2013 as you go into the enterprise, we tend to get customers buying three-year deals or longer. They're really just spending out, because they don't want to be doing the renewals. We're seeing that on a competitive basis, that competitive landscape, I think our competitors see the same thing. And what happens when you mix those two things together, they end up compounding the deferral of revenue from the product line to deferred revenue. And that's why you see product revenue at 7%. But deferred revenue you see growing 30% and off of maybe a one month increase in average duration. And so basically that's what's happening there on the product line. I think that becomes harder to forecast, if you will. But at the end of the day, it has the effect of what you're saying, where you're just ending up basically becoming more subscription oriented, more routable, more predictable on the revenue line so to speak. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Makes sense. We are not intend to slow down the product growth. The way we calculate maybe have a few percentage impact. But also we're a little bit behind hiring the sales capacity. So we already realized that a couple months ago, starting to try to accelerate hiring, but also that takes some time to see the results. So that's where we're a little bit cautious about Q4. But we do intend to keeping growing the product side together with service. Anne M. Meisner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. And then quick follow-up on the service provider vertical that's been a topic of conversation for you guys. Some of your competitors have also discussed kind of making a bigger push into that market. And again, I'm talking about the traditional service provider markets and not the cloud providers. Maybe you can just kind of talk about what you're seeing in terms of the competition? Are you seeing anything different there, are sales cycles lengthening because customers are just taking more time to evaluate other products in the market as well? Maybe you can kind of speak to what you're seeing competitively, specifically in service provider. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Service provider, like a few years ago is a big sector for us. They account more than 25% of business. But in the last couple of years, there's some changes shifting there. The call provider starting have more interest compared with traditional service provider, so we realized this one or two years ago starting build a team, the call team, the service product team together and grow both. So if you combine these two together, we have healthy growth, but the traditional service provider they're also try to position themselves compared to the new cloud provider. That's where we view, long-term wise, the service provider \u2013 that means together with call provider is still a big potential, big growth. But somehow the industry has some change in transition going on right now. The traditional service provider, kind of, whether they slowed down some investment infrastructure, whether (9:01), and then the new call provider have some impact there. And some of the traditional service provider also moved to the cloud. So that's the part we feel is not quite settled down yet, and we see a lot of new testing going on. But they are not quite reached some of the decision or like big deployment yet. Anne M. Meisner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Melissa Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the discussion on the product revenue and the deferral. So, when you do have to defer a higher percentage of product revenue than you've seen in the past, I just want to clarify, does that go into product deferred and then eventually it gets recognized into product? Or is that really the percent is moving to subscription, the value goes into subscription, and then that eventually flows through to subscription revenue line? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Good question, Melissa. And just to back up, I mean, by the way all of this is a characterization of an improving enterprise business, to be frank, right? We're getting more complicated deals, they're buying more, and they're buying more of the services and subscriptions. To answer your question directly, yes, it ends up being in services, in subscriptions. So it gets \u2013 I use the word carved out, a product, and then re-characterized as services and subscriptions and recognized over time. Not back into product. Melissa Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's perfect. Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys, a couple of questions. First I just want to \u2013 just kind of a housekeeping on CapEx. I was wondering if we're still in line for doing $150 million or so this year, maybe $90 million next year, and then growing from there? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We're \u2013 I didn't \u2013 Michael, we're in line for $150 million this year. I didn't hear the second part of the question. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then I have it at $90 million for next year, and then growing after that? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes, we haven't guided for next year, but I think we said \u2013 I suspect the way you're getting there, and not to put words in your mouth, but it's probably roughly $30 million of general CapEx and maybe $60 million of real estate. Because I think we said $60 million and $60 million of real estate for the next couple of years, if I go back to the last calls. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. But then it (11:34) Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: That would get me \u2013 that would get to about $90 million, again, we haven't formally guided for next year, but I think people tend to ask us what's our run rate CapEx, and it generally weights out to be around $30 million. You know, could be plus or minus a little bit, and then the real estate has, as we fill out the headquarter property, we've said $60 million and $60 million for, I think 2018 and 2019. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then I just wanted to understand, Ken, you were talking about the traditional service providers. I assume you mean the carriers, and then you were talking about the cloud service providers, but I didn't understand. Was your point that the cloud \u2013 that you're starting to sell more to the cloud service providers as opposed to the carriers? But that's not making up the difference? I was trying to understand what you were trying to convey. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: We category a little bit differently the call provider and also the traditional service provider. I think so far the service provider still more count on the traditional service provider, not (12:32), the service provider line, the vertical. Yeah. That's where the one we gave out I think it was 17% adjusted traditional service provider, there's no cloud provider there, but they do have a cloud provider starting to... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: It's actually in there. I think it includes \u2013 from a provider perspective it's in there, right? If it were a virtual license, it would either be a product or on the subscription services line, if it's routable. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay. Yes, we can confirm with you later. Yes. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Yes. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then another question. So it sounds as if one of the major factors is lumpiness in the enterprise business, longer sale cycles, bigger deals, more complex. And this sounds like something that you went through a couple of years ago where enterprise got really good, and then it got tougher and the way you explained it at that time, was that you were doing well with winning a lot of those large, high-end box and larger deals, but you weren't getting \u2013 I think you termed it as the run rate enterprise business that would drive more consistency. I'm wondering, is that the same dynamic that we're seeing this time around? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I think it's different. What we're seeing now is more complexity because they're thinking architecturally. Again, to step back and you think about security spend, I think Ken mentioned earlier that post-Target everyone, there was a lot of reactionary buying. What you're seeing now is more strategic buying, and the Fabric resonates extremely well because, as Ken said, it's broad, integrated, and an open architecture, if you will, provides the management capabilities. And so if they buy the full package, the Fabric or more of the Fabric, like the example I gave, they end up with more products. And then from a forecasting perspective I think it becomes more of a challenge because they may buy some or all at the same time and I think that's where it generally from a sales perspective becomes harder to forecast. You know they believe they may get a customer for instance, but forecasting the actual deal size when there were a variety of products on it, may shift some in or out of the quarter and like you said, you know some of it may become more run rate, some of it may become more upfront, but as they think architecturally, I think this just becomes more of a challenge to basically forecast at a basic level. Again, and to revisit, again we did a very good job I think of drilling into our geographies and trying to understand what was going on in the business, and I'm going to repeat myself here but we did, when we look at North Asia we saw some macroeconomic issues there, really we believe due to geopolitical issues and then we're talking to our people on the street there and that's what they're telling us. And in Latin America, we have a sizable business especially in Mexico and somewhat in the Caribbean and we saw some softness there in Q3 and the team is telling us to call that forward into Q4, and that's a bit of the explanation. And then as Ken said, just to go back, we're a bit behind on head count. And I think all of those factors weigh in and blend together and it's hard to weight one ahead of the other, but they blend to form the forecast or the guidance this quarter. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, Drew, Ken. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, but your gross margin guidance has bumped up over the course of fiscal 2017. Is there any reason why it would reverse and go back down in 2018 or are there any trends that were anomalistic in 2017 that we should be factoring in? And then similarly, you did about 18% to 19% operating margins for Q2 and Q3, and that's your guidance for Q4. How can we think of trends in terms of your hiring as you look into fiscal 2018? Is it likely to come down because you're going to be hiring aggressively? Or how should we think about that? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: So I think there's two questions in there. There is a bit of a head count question I think, Erik, is the second part in that ramp. And I believe the first part is related to gross margin. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yeah. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: And so on the gross margin, one of the interesting things is it actually would have been better if we didn't have the carve-outs that Anne and I were discussing earlier. Because effectively, we're recognizing the cost of goods sold \u2013 the hardware cost upfront, yet we're deferring more of the product revenue onto the balance sheet. And so that margin ends up coming back over time in that strong, ratable revenue recognition, if you will. So structurally \u2013 the way to think about it is, structurally our business is driving higher margins all around with this mix shift to one, more enterprise, and then more Fabric. And that Fabric's composed not only of non-FortiGate products, but more margin rich services and subscription and if you blend that together, Erik, you end up with a higher-margin business, because most of that's higher margin and to the extent that some of that's product revenue coming back on through the services and subscription line, I've already taken the cost of goods sold in the quarter I shifted. So that's the first part. Headcount, we're behind. And again, we believe, structurally our business has changed, it's driving higher margins, and we need to make sure that we catch up on head count so that we can continue to grow. And so we're balancing that out and we'll talk about guidance when we get into 2018. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Ken, can you just comment, though, how far behind are you on head count? I think you added over 100 this quarter. Would you have liked to have added 300? Or how can we think about the plans on the head count front? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think to supporting some of the growth target we have, we probably need to add little bit over 100 a quarter, but in the first two quarter we are less than half of that. And that's also making margin probably above the target, and the Q4 guidance will be low. So we realized that. We (19:23) in Q3, but it's Q4 we need to keep and catch up some of head count hiring. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Very good. Thank you. Kelly Blough - Fortinet, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Just a question for you on the product gross margin. You did talk a lot about the traction that you're seeing in the enterprise, and we saw the products mix skew very nicely to the high end of your portfolio. But the product gross margins were essentially flat sequentially. So is there any other dynamic that we need to consider that's kind of going into that line? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : And then just a quick follow-up on free cash flow and any modeling points you could share with us? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay. So Fatima, I think I heard two questions, product gross margin and then I think you're talking free cash flow guidance. Fair enough? Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Correct. Yes. Thanks. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Good. So what I was attempting to explain to Erik earlier is that basically because we end up with a combination of more content-rich services being sold, if you will, more higher level of FortiCare support 7x24 versus 5x8. And then richer content in the subscriptions that are higher priced, like the enterprise bundle for instance. That combined with duration, longer duration we shifted from 24 to 25 months, causes more of a carve-out if you will, more of a deferral from the product line being re-characterized onto the services and subscriptions line, if you will, the services line ultimately, the services and subscription. And what that does is, while we're effectively taking that product revenue over time on those lines, the cost is recognized upfront. And so if you really looked at it on a deal-by-deal basis, the margins actually are better than reflected in the gross margin line. It would be higher, for instance, if you just looked at it on a billings perspective. And that's really what's going on there. There were no other anomalies in the quarter. I think last quarter we referenced taking some reserves on inventory. We didn't do anything out of the ordinary on that front this quarter. It's just really a reflection of some of that product revenue ending up in deferred revenue, which grew 30%. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Very clear. Thank you. And just any directional color you could share on free cash flow and how that shakes out because you had a very strong collection quarter this quarter. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: What we guide is \u2013 to be frank we've been focused on linearity and cash conversion cycle, Fatima. It becomes a little harder to predict because there's a lot of timing differences in there. I think I can share CapEx. We expect still to end up at CapEx at $150 million for the year. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I'll jump back in line. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And we spent $122 million to-date I believe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious, have you made any changes to either the frequency or the methods you're using to evaluate your pipeline? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: No, Ken. We continue to look at it very closely. No, we haven't made any changes. Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI : Okay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, there's a greater shift of ratable revenue. Can you give us a sense for maybe for 4Q how much of your ratable revenue is expected to be rolling off the balance sheet from deferred? Kelly Blough - Fortinet, Inc.: I don't think we've ever released that metric, how much of the in-quarter revenue came off the balance sheet. I mean, it's reflected in the services line. If you look at the balance between product and services revenue in an individual quarter, it should sort of reflect that percentage. Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from Patrick Colville with Arete Research. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Thanks for taking my question. I've got quite an easy layout one first. You guys are still growing product revenue faster than the markets. Who are you taking shares from right now, October 2017? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think, if you look in the first half of this year, our building growth probably faster than any other major security vendor, and so probably we take some share. I think anyone grow below the market range, so we take share from them. I cannot name the... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I would say we're playing on the theme of where integration and that organic integration really sells well, where we can get the visibility end-to-end, Patrick, and that tends to be large enterprises. And so that could be a variety of incumbents, quite frankly, and I think you could probably guess the names. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And the enterprise section grow faster than the other section, so that's where some traditional enterprise player will take quite some share from there. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Got it. Okay. Sure. Thanks. And then if I can add two quick follow-up. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: And also especially in U.S. I have to say, you can see U.S. is a fast-growing region. So that's where we take most share from some of the U.S. player. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Got it. Okay. I mean, I guess the basis of the question is that some investors are nervous that Cisco and Juniper have less share to give up. And one of the reasons for the kind of slowdown in the products' growth is because there's less share to take from those guys. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Some of other competitor also, their U.S. slowdown probably below the market growth. We also take some share from there. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Okay. And then, Drew, quick question on the share repurchases. It looks like you guys are doing that more consistently now. And the kind of dollar amount increases (25:57). Is that something we should kind of think about modeling forward, just much more consistent quarter-on-quarter share repurchasing? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, as we said on the call, the board I think is signaling a more aggressive approach to share repurchases. And they approved up to $1 billion, the current authorization. I think we have $765 million remaining, or had, as of the end September. And so as far as consistent, I think it's a little harder to say, but more aggressive for sure. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Hey. Hi, guys. This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. I wanted to understand the price difference that happens when you actually sell a virtual firewall in lieu of a physical firewall. Assume that you are going into an enterprise and selling a physical box, and in lieu of that, if you sell a virtual firewall to them, what is the pricing economics on that for the same throughput? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, Ugam, the way we answer the question is that it's an accretive model to the overall business because right now what we're selling, we're seeing multi-cloud environments where they're buying a variety of products. And whether it's the virtual \u2013 the cloud orientation is pulling the hardware as well because it's a hybrid model. And so the economics work out and it's accretive to our model. The other way to think about it is that to the extent that there's virtual, it's a higher-margin business. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Okay. Okay. That's pretty helpful. And secondly, just to expand on the share repurchase program, in terms of assuming, are you planning to do share repurchases that offsets the dilution in share count, or are you willing to go beyond that and do more share repurchase to offset more than the dilution? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Right now we are focused on being more aggressive on the share repurchases. Again, I'll repeat what I just said, and I'll have to leave it that. And you can see, first of all, the board approved up to $1 billion of share repurchases. We have $765 million remaining. You could see that we're becoming more profitable on a GAAP basis, and we are very focused on the equity comp aspect of the dilution, if you will, and that's how I would answer that question. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Smith with First Analysis. Howard S. Smith - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on kind of the other side of the gross margin, not product but services. That continues to grow, and I know part of that is the opposite of what we just talked about, the deferred coming through and being very high-margin. I calculated about 95%-plus incrementally this quarter on a non-GAAP basis. Is there some head count adjustment, a catch-up that needs to be done that would affect that line? Or is it just that profitable as the incremental services come in? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, we're effectively \u2013 I think you're getting scale benefits is the way to think about the answer, because you're really getting more revenue on a not completely constant head count or infrastructure basis. There are some scale investments. There are some investments you need to make in head count over time. We're probably a little behind on that, which helps a little bit, but I don't think it's significant and probably not the right way to think about it, but a little bit behind on head count on the support side, if you will. We've become more efficient all around on just managing the business, and things like RMAs, for instance, RMA costs are I think managed better over time, and so we're driving efficiencies like that. And so even though you might hire more people and it's not a huge ramp there, we're finding ways to offset it by driving other efficiencies in the business. And then you offset it again by just increasing revenue on the services line, like we talked about, that mix shift benefit. Howard S. Smith - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. I'll leave it at one. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-ups here. So first, Drew, just on the billings guidance. I've just got \u2013 sort of got a philosophical kind of question on the approach. If you compared your approach to billings guidance today, compared to the approach that you took at the end of Q2, and what we (31:01) raised it in Q2, we're trimming it now. If we exclude some of the regional stuff, has the pipeline for enterprise this year gone down? Or is it maybe more prudent close rates on that enterprise pipeline than you expected before? Does that make sense? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. So as the pipeline goes down, or do you need higher \u2013 I think are you asking if you need higher close rates? Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Or are you assuming lower close rates in the fourth quarter guide than maybe you did before? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Not really. I think overall, we're billing off \u2013 it's a variety of things. I mean that's one of the factors in there, Saket, but we're really relying on our sales force to tell us what they're going to do and call the shots. And when you dig into it, as we said, take out the macroeconomic issues by the various geographies and the carrier business, what they're all trying to sell is the broader fabric, and I think it just becomes more complicated on exactly what a company is going to buy at any given point in time. And so that really creates the complexity we have in forecasting going forward. I would point that as the issue. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And then a quick follow-up, if I could squeeze in, and forgive me, it's probably a dumb question. But I just wanted to understand the pricing just a little bit better. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I guess on the carve-out accounting, I think we get sort of the idea of additional content that enterprise customers are getting. You mentioned 7/24 instead of 5/8, but if an enterprise customer is getting more, wouldn't the carve-out be of a higher number? Or are we maybe discounting that, so the carve-out is actually impacting the same number? Could you just talk about that number, that approach to pricing a little bit? Maybe that could help clear some of the confusion about sort of the carve-out and the products... Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. Saket, I'm going to ask you to \u2013 if you could \u2013 I didn't quite \u2013 I'm trying to answer the right question. If you could perhaps maybe ask it again? Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So can you talk a little bit about the pricing in a carve-out situation. So in a situation where an enterprise customer maybe opts for more content-rich items like an enterprise bundle or 7/24 support, that would presumably be additive to a deal. And so the carve-out, right, would be a carve-out of a larger number. But I guess it almost implies that maybe we're seeing larger carve-outs of the same number. Am I thinking about that right? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: I think two factors. I would say two factors. Generally speaking, if we're going to discount on a deal, and we can talk about discounting if you want, it's not a big issue. But to the extent there's always some discounting, the discount would tend to be on the product line to preserve the annuity stream on the recurring revenue lines, which are the subscriptions and services. As you discount across the board, you end up carving more out from product to deferred. And I think the compounding factor tends to be the duration that we pointed out, quite frankly. And that's what's going on where the duration impact, we've gone from 24 to 25 months I think average duration. That compounds. So on a three-year deal, you end up carving out 3x of whatever you were going to carve out, and regardless of where the discounting occurred. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. It's a follow-up on Saket's question, actually, so for Drew. One of the things that has been mentioned a couple of times is that enterprise deals are becoming more complex, they are a larger pieces of the business. Given that that seems a little more structural or ongoing in nature rather than temporary, I'm wondering if there are business intelligence tools or forecasting tools that could maybe help internally to drive a little more consistency in the forecasting, given that it feels like this is something that will be ongoing over the medium-term. Kelly Blough - Fortinet, Inc.: I mean, I think it's fair to say that we know what tools are available at our disposal. We do pay a lot of attention to forecasting. We have regular meetings with our executive team and our sales team to go over the forecasts. I mean we get your point, Gabriela. In this particular case, it feels more like there were things that were in the forecast that came out because of, for example, the things that Drew mentioned, the Mexico environment, (35:54), Latin America, and other parts of the world. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We take your input, Gabriela. I would say this. We're very diligent in drilling down on the forecast and getting the explanation from our sales team and understand what's going on all around. And at the end of the day, that's the most important thing, is really getting the story and getting what their commitments are and why, and effectively, that's the story we're relaying to you. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. That makes sense. Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question, and I apologize if it's been asked, we've had five calls tonight. One thing I noticed during the quarter was channel, you brought back a person that had been at Fortinet and promoted him. Can you just give a little update and more color on the channel strategy, where are you headed with it, U.S. versus Asia versus other geographies? Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Jon Bove came back. He was excellent. He came back from Proofpoint, and an excellent employee. Nothing's really changed in the strategy. We believe our business is doing fine there. We look at that in detail. We haven't seen any issues there, and we believe Jon is a great addition coming back into the team, and we think we're fine. Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks. Kelly Blough - Fortinet, Inc.: Is there a second part to that, Catharine? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: No. That was really what I was looking for. I noticed he came back. Obviously he likes working for you, so congratulations. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Co. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Drew, product gross margin is lower this year than last year, and you alluded that it's driven by the shift of products to different revenue. Should we view this gross margin trend to amplify to a larger degree down the road? In other words, whether product gross margin may slide down further as this trend grows. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: The way I would think about it is to re-characterize revenue that in some way causes a slightly-lower gross margin this quarter will shift the trend, that's on the product line slightly-lower gross margin on the product line this quarter \u2013 excuse me \u2013 will tend to come back as ratable revenue over time. And, really, I think you want to look at them in tandem, as a blend of gross margin, because it comes back as a higher gross margin altogether. And if you look back over the last several years, gross margin has gone up from Q3 of 2014 about 71.5% to 76% this quarter-end. So that's a bit of what's going on. And if I look back over the quarter, 59% is not out of line with some of the past quarters. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Got it. And one question for Ken, with regard to the challenges of less predictability and more complexity in enterprise deals, do you see this as unique to Fortinet? Or do you see this as a general situation that applies to your market and your competitors? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: We just need to get a sales force, more trend for some enterprise, especially the new sales force. We are starting our salary hiring, so that's taking a little bit more time to ramp up. That's where \u2013 like I said, you can improve your margin quickly, easily, probably the same quarter or the next. But to invest in growth, that takes about 6 months to 12 months. So if we are behind or early in (39:39) the year, we're catching up, and that's probably we'll not see the result in the quarter right away. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: And if I understand that correctly, so that implies that partially it's due to the sales force situation and partially it may be driven by the customers in the market overall. I don't mean to put some words on your mouth, but is that the right interpretation? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also sometime we will sell multiple products. It's a little bit more complicated and maybe take a little bit more training, more time compared to traditionally more single firewall product. Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Thanks. Your operating cash flow, you said that's going to grow in line with the operating income going forward. But obviously, in 2017, it looks like operating cash flow clearly outpaced operating income. Do you think it'll more closely track operating income growth in 2018 and beyond? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, when you step back, I think a couple of things have happened. One, as you said, I think you've had some margin expansion, if you will. And that characterized part of it. And we've also done a really good job I think on cash conversion cycle growing, basically increasing our working capital. We'll continue to focus on that Andrew, but it's a little early to really call that for next year. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Fair enough. And then DSOs continued to decline as well, despite the lumpiness in the large deals that you called out. So what are your expectations for DSOs going forward? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, again we've been focused on as I would say cash conversion cycle, and that includes linearity as a component and working with sales to drive more even linearity. And we saw that in Q3. It's a little harder to predict what will happen in Q4. Quite frankly, it'd be nice to see that continue, but it'd be a little early to call that one too. But we remain focused on it to be fair, we do. We talk about it. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Then, Ken, I think you mentioned that you started to see a refresh cycle having a more material impact two years out. Are you seeing any customers thinking about upgrading their firewalls to get better SSL decryption performance, given the increasing amount of encrypted traffic that's coming into a data center now? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Some service providers, some call providers, for them I treat SSL encryption acceleration is very important. And using (42:05) approach, difficult to achieve that high performance, so with our SPU, the secured processor, they can run that acceleration 10 to 100 times faster, and even at lower costs after 100 times acceleration. So that's where we see quite some opportunity and also business from there. So it's SSL definitely driving some of the major growth, especially on the e-commerce, on the web based. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : My question has been asked. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Back at it (42:55) again. Drew, just a question for you on some of the longer-term targets that you've talked about historically. So, you're tracking at about 18% billings growth for this year, but the longer-term aspiration is to hit kind of the 20% mark. So the acceleration there, can you help me understand what the input would be to help you drive towards that? And maybe contrast that with some of your comments around you being behind on hiring? As well as some of your comments around 150 basis points to 200 basis points of per annum (43:31) expansion on the operating margin? So just help triangulate your billings acceleration, you being behind on hiring, but then also sort of driving operational efficiencies to drive margin expansion? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure, Fatima. Structurally, our business is driving higher margins and you could see that primarily from the gross margin impact, and I think we spent a lot of time talking on the mix shift and more enterprise business and how that reflects more on the deferred revenue, where you have some of the upfront margin due to the product side over time, and then you take \u2013 the ratable revenue comes back really in pure margin over time. And so that's a tailwind to the business and it's a structural change that's driving. Also, you get more subscription and services revenue, not on a completely flat cost basis on the gross margin line, but it drives, there's scale benefits in that business. And you've seen the leverage as we move forward on the operating lines as well. In terms of head count, we absolutely need to catch up, and that would really be the question in the balance at this point in time. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And if I can sneak another one in. Kelly Blough - Fortinet, Inc.: Sure. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : You talked at a high level about the penetration success you've seen with the enterprise bundles as well as the SMB bundles. You have a tremendously large base and, historically, because you sold your security functionalities sort of a la carte, if you will, can you help us understand what proportion of the base still not had a chance to buy into the bundle proposition, whether it's SMB or enterprise? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. There's actually a couple of things, Fatima. One is the enterprise bundle. Then there's also selling a higher level of support, if you will. We talked about 7x24 versus 8x5. And then we continue to focus on developing more higher-priced higher-content bundles, if you will, which seem to be resonating very well as we continue to sell the Fabric. And so I would characterize it as early, still in that process. We believe we have way to go to upsell and cross-sell and move that into our install base. We're very focused on it and so there's plenty of opportunity there. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. Just a quick question. Have your hiring plans been altered at all by your real estate investment plans? I mean is there a correlation there? Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: No. Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anne Meisner with Susquehanna Financial. Anne M. Meisner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Drew, quick follow-up for you. I don't think we've discussed everyone's favorite subject yet, which is ASC 606. And I know that the last time you gave an update, you felt that there wasn't going to be a ton of change in sort of the recognition part of that on the rev rec side, I guess. But since we're kind of talking about product recognition and carve-outs, I just wanted to ask you again because some other security vendors have talked about how ASC 606 may require them to ratably recognize the appliances because they would be kind of tied to their subscription components. And I'm just wondering if that's something that might end up being the case for your model as well. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: We're not finding that to be the case, Anne, obviously we're not through it, but right now we would still say that we don't see a significant impact on the revenue line. Anne M. Meisner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. Thanks. Andrew H. Del Matto - Fortinet, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Kelly Blough - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you again, everyone, for being on both calls today, and if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to call me. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude this program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

A replay of this call will be available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks to everyone for joining today's call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 result. As we begin 2018, Fortinet has more market momentum and opportunities than ever. Our fourth quarter again demonstrated strong market leadership with revenue and billing growth of 15%. For the full year 2017, our revenue grew 17%, while our billing grew 19%. Based on reported billings, Fortinet grow faster than any of our top competitors over the last four quarters. In 2018, we will continue to deliver growth in excess of the market, balanced with profitability. Four powerful growth engines will drive our business in 2018. First, our core business of network security continues to offer growth in new, displacement and adjacent market such as SD-WAN. The announcement we did today of FortiGate 6000 series will provide another opportunity for market share gains. The 6000 series is the fastest next-generation firewall appliance in the industry and is fully integrated with the Fortinet Security Fabric. It is built upon a new hardware process and architecture that delivers over 100-gig of advanced threat protection and SSL inspection to handle massive volume of traffic driven by increased adoption of the cloud. Second, we have only just begun to scratch the surface of the Security Fabric adoption. Billings for non-FortiGate security product and services were about a quarter of our business. We are still in the early stage of Security Fabric adoption, and there's a huge opportunity for growth. Third, cloud security is the fastest-growing part of our business. We will continue to expand our solution and the business model for multi-cloud environments. We deliver the broadest portfolio of cloud security applications, all managed through a single, integrated, management console with automated threat response and policy, unified control, workload visibility and management across all cloud environments. We just announced that Fortinet cloud security is now available on the Google Cloud Platform, making our cloud security solution available across all major cloud providers, including Microsoft, AWS, Google, IBM and Oracle. For the fourth growth engine, we will continue to extend broad security to IoT and OT environments. In January, at CES, we demonstrated integrated security and threat protection for the connected car for the future, an example of how IoT and digital transformation are creating new security growth opportunities. In 2017, we received more independent industry validation than our close competitor, with eight recommendations from NSS Labs. And as of 2017, Fortinet now appears in six Gartner Magic Quadrant. Fortinet is strongly positioned to lead in each of these area because of our vision, investment, and superior technology. Fortinet also continue to expand the visibility and control of Security Fabric to third-party solution providers. In 2017 alone, we welcomed 18 new partners to our Fabric-Ready Partner Program, including industry leaders such as Intel, AWS, Microsoft. Our Fabric-Ready Program now stretches to 37 eco partners. Our reach in the market continue to expand. The investment we have made in sales and marketing has driven strong penetration in the enterprise space, which was a key driver to our growth in 2017. According to IDC, we again shipped more appliance than our two nearest competitors combined through Q3 of 2017. This unit-driven increase to subscription services and other security functionality and enable us to monetize our customer base for the years to come. I and the rest of the leadership team and Fortinet are proud of the significant accomplishments our team made in 2017, and we look forward to even greater success in 2018 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to Drew to review our fourth quarter and the full-year results, I would like to share that this afternoon we announced the appointment of Keith Jensen as our Interim Chief Finance Officer, effective February 16. Keith will be replacing Drew who has served as the CFO since January 2014 and is departing Fortinet for another opportunity. Drew has made a strong impact on the business and has significantly contributed to the company's growth and profitability. During his time here, he developed a deep bench of seasoned leaders and a strong financial organization to support and grow the business. We wish Drew the very best in his new role, and we thank him for his significant contributions. I will now turn the call over to Drew. Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Ken. My past four years at Fortinet have been incredibly rewarding, and I'm honored to have worked with Ken, Michael and the rest of the Fortinet team. I'll miss everyone as I move onto a new opportunity, and I'm excited for Keith to be taking over the Interim CFO role. Given today's announcement, I'm going to review our fourth quarter results and then hand the call over to Keith so he can provide guidance. Let me now share our financial results for the fourth quarter, which can be seen on Slide 3. Fortinet had a very strong end to 2017. For Q4 2017, billings increased 15% year-over-year to $534 million. Revenue of $417 million was also up 15% year-over-year. Security subscriptions and support services continued to drive our business with overall services revenue growing 25% year-over-year. Deferred revenue grew to $1.336 billion up 29% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing business shift to more margin-rich recurring security subscriptions and support services. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 76%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.32. We generated free cash flow of $144 million or 35% of revenue. Operating cash flow was $158 million, an increase of 56% year-over-year. For FY 2017, billings grew 19% to $1.796 billion. Revenue grew 17% to $1.495 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for 2017 was 17.2%, which grew 210 basis points over 2016. In 2017, the business generated $459 million in free cash flow and used $446 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares of Fortinet stock. This quarter, we experienced strong deal flow in our six-figure enterprise deals, driven by the adoption of Fortinet Security Fabric. Non-FortiGate-related billings represented about a quarter of our billings in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Multiple product adoption continues to contribute to growth in deal sizes. Year-over-year, the number of deals over $100,000 grew 21%. The number of deals over $250,000 grew 31%, while deals over $500,000 grew 24%. We had a record 40 deals over $1 million in the quarter, beating the previous record of 39 deals recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Among our enterprise successes in the quarter was a mid-seven-figure deal with a U.S. CRM company. This new Fortinet customer sought a single vendor that could unify and integrate security across the next-generation network infrastructure, stretching from the local area network to the cloud. We provided a truly integrated and comprehensive fabric solution, including FortiGate, FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiSIEM and FortiSandbox. This customer is a good example of a hybrid cloud implementation of Fortinet Security Fabric using Fortinet's AWS offering managed centrally from their security operations center and seamlessly integrated with their on-premise security deployment. The breakdown of billings across our top 5 verticals was service provider at 22%, government at 16%, financial services at 12%, retail at 9% and education at 8%. The cloud continues to be a driver for our business. In 2017, billings driven by the cloud, including virtual machines, SaaS, and hyperscalers represented the fastest-growing part of our business.  We also saw strong growth in on-demand consumption. Across all cloud partners, we are seeing strong growth with five and six-figure engagements through AWS and Azure. As Ken mentioned, we're very excited that Fortinet cloud security is now available on the Google Cloud Platform. Our government business in the United States and the rest of the world continues to expand, demonstrating that customers with the highest level of security needs trust Fortinet to protect their most sensitive data and assets. For example, during the fourth quarter, a European government agency that handles highly confidential information chose Fortinet over an incumbent solution in a large fabric contract. This customer chose Fortinet Security Fabric for its high level of performance, as well as our industry-leading integration, segmentation and threat intelligence capabilities. Turning to billings by product range on Slide 4. High-end product billings accounted for 41% of total product billings; midrange products accounted for 29%; and our entry-level products accounted for 30%. It's important to note that deals, including high and midrange products tend to include more security subscriptions, support services and more non-fabric solutions. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $417 million, up 15% over a very strong fourth quarter of 2016. As you can see on Slide 5, revenue performance was driven by 25% year-over-year services revenue growth. Product revenue was up 2% year-over-year. As previously mentioned, there are two significant reasons for the single digit product revenue growth.  First, the mix shift towards higher-value security subscriptions and support services leads to a larger percentage of revenue being deferred onto the balance sheet for recognition in future periods. Second, our continued enterprise segment success is leading to longer-term deals. As a result, our average contract length in the fourth quarter increased sequentially one month to 26 months. As you could see from Slide 6 and 7, revenue from the Americas represented 42% of our business and grew 16% year-over-year. Revenue from EMEA represented 38% of our business and grew 14% year-over-year. And revenue from APAC represented 20% of our business and also grew 14% year-over-year. On a geographic basis, billings in the Americas grew 10% year-over-year. EMEA billings grew 20%, and APAC billings grew 17%. Our gross margin remains strong due to the mix shift in our business driving high-margin subscriptions and deferred revenue. This deferred revenue will roll off the balance sheet into revenue in subsequent period, providing a tailwind to longer-term gross margins. During the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin was 76%. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 87%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 58%. As I've mentioned in prior quarters, this also negatively affects our product gross margin as hardware costs are recognized in the income statement upon shipment. Additionally, when this deferred revenue rolls off the balance sheet into the revenue, it's recognized without any associated COGS. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $237 million during the fourth quarter, resulting in non-GAAP operating income of $79 million or 19% of revenue. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $55 million or $0.32 per share based on approximately 175 million diluted shares, a reduction of 3.6 million shares from the third quarter, due to share repurchases. As expected, the annualized non-GAAP tax rate was 32%. Slides 8 and 9 review our balance sheet and provide more information for your reference on our cash flow. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $1.349 billion in cash and investments. As I mentioned earlier, cash from operations was $158 million, representing growth of 56% over the same period last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $144 million. In 2017, Fortinet generated free cash flow of $459 million. On an adjusted basis, excluding real estate purchases, Fortinet generated $566 million in 2017, representing a free cash flow margin of 38%. We've added an adjusted free cash flow slide, Number 10 in the deck, for your reference. Deferred revenue grew to $1.336 billion, an increase of $301 million or 29% year-over-year. DSO was 75 days, down 3 days from the fourth quarter of 2016. Returning value to our shareholders was a key hallmark of 2017. As promised on our prior call, we were aggressive with share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We used $322 million to repurchase a total of 7.9 million shares at an average price of $40.73. In 2017, we used $446 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares of Fortinet stock at an average price of $39.83. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $443 million remained in our Board of Directors' authorization for share repurchases through January of 2019. For the full-year 2017, billings were $1.796 billion, representing growth of 19% over 2016. Revenue grew 17% to $1.495 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 75% and non-GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, representing an improvement of 210 basis points over 2016. This is 120 basis points higher than what we originally guided for the year. Now, I'd like to introduce everyone to Keith Jensen who will be named Fortinet's Interim CFO upon my departure. Keith is a 35-year finance veteran who I hired in May of 2014 to be our Chief Accounting Officer. Before becoming a valuable part of my team, Keith served as the Chief Administrative and Accounting Officer at DataDirect Networks and Chief Accounting Officer at Sybase. Before Sybase, Keith was Chief Financial Officer of Dorado Network Systems. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Drew. Before I go through our guidance, I'd like to thank Drew for being an excellent leader, mentor, and friend for the past four years. It was a pleasure working with you, Drew, and I wish you very well in your next endeavor. I'd now like to share our guidance for the first quarter and full-year of 2018, which can be seen on Slide 12. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements, including all of the guidance statements provided, are subject to Peter's caution at the start of this call. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect billings in the range of $449 million to $457 million, reflecting first quarter seasonality; revenue in the range of $387 million to $393 million, also impacted by seasonality; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margins of 12% to 13%, also impacted by seasonality and our continued investment in our sales team. Please note, we expect the operating margin benefit of at least 150 basis points from the adoption of ASC 606, taking our operating margin up to a range of 13.5% to 14.5%. I'd also note non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter at $0.21 to $0.22. For 2018, we expect billings in the range of $2.030 billion to $2.050 billion; revenue in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.715 billion; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 17.7% to 18%, representing a 170 to 200 basis-point improvement over our original 2017 guidance. Note also, we expect an additional operating benefit of at least 150 basis points from the adoption of ASC 606, taking our operating margins up to a range of 19.2% to 19.5%; the non-GAAP tax rate at 24%; non-GAAP earnings per share for the year, $1.30 and $1.32. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Ken to close. Ken Xie : Thank you, Keith, and congratulations on your promotion to Fortinet Interim Chief Finance Officer, and thank you again, Drew, for your outstanding contribution to Fortinet. We are very pleased with our strong finish to 2017 and with the industry leadership that Fortinet continue to demonstrate. I would like to thank Fortinet employee, partner, customer, and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Peter Salkowski : Operator, before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to invite everybody on the call to the 2018 Analyst Day event taking place at The Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas on Tuesday, February 27. A registration link can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Events. Financial presentations will be webcast and available on our IR website, but we hope to see many of you there. With that, operator, we're ready to start the Q&A session. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Melissa Franchi : Thank you for taking my question. Drew, congratulations to you and best of luck. So just a question on the Q4 billings growth. I think last quarter when you guided, you noted a number of headwinds, including, I think, elongating sales cycles as you are just moving into the enterprise space, as well as under-hiring in sales heads. So, I'm just wondering if you can maybe update us on how those factors played out in the quarter relative to your expectations. And was there anything that came in a little bit better or perhaps a little bit worse than what you were expecting? Drew Del Matto : Thank you, Melissa. I think Q4 actually went really smoothly. I mean, if you look at one of the indicators that's interesting is DSO because it was down 3 days versus Q4 of last year. And what we saw was a pretty, I would say, high-velocity quarter with transactions flowing throughout the quarter. And that's important because when we talked about some of the concerns we had when we guided, most of those turned out to not be issues at the end of the day. Things actually flowed very smoothly throughout the quarter, and it was just a nice ramp right to the end of the quarter. And when we look back, I think we only talked about Latin America and some geopolitical things and even in the carrier space, it all turned out to go really smoothly. Melissa Franchi : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your question please. Sterling Auty : Thanks. I actually want to follow up on Melissa's question initially. You mentioned the one very large deal with the CRM company. It seemed like a lot of our research from a number of people on The Street were indicating there was probably more than one large deal. Were these follow-on deals? Were they large companies that were buying fabric for the first time? And was there any change in the go to market on those types of deals with any of them coming direct or through alternative channel partners than usual? Drew Del Matto : We're very committed to channel partners. We really do sell almost everything through the channel and rely on our partners to sell alongside of us. So, we're very successful on that front. The CRM deal that you referenced was a new customer. So, we won that over an incumbent. And that was truly a fabric solution. As I mentioned before, they bought not only FortiGate, but FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiSIEM, FortiSandbox and a variety of other products along the way. And it's also a hybrid cloud implementation of Fortinet Security Fabric, and they're using Amazon Web Services, AWS, which they're actually managing centrally from their own security operation center. So, it's seamlessly integrated with their on-premise security deployment and it's just a great win, illustrates the power of the fabric in an enterprise. Sterling Auty : Got it. Got it. And you mentioned the benefit to margins from 606, but I believe in terms of the footnotes in the guidance on the slides, that the revenue does not reflect 606 impact, can you give us a sense of what that might look like? Keith Jensen : Sure, I would try it this way. This is Keith Jensen, Sterling. We would describe the revenue impact as being insignificant both to revenue and to the trends in revenue. Small impact on some software licenses that we were previously amortizing over time, a little bit of change in the U.S. model in terms of when we recognize revenue either in sell-in or sell-through, but those are largely offset by the deferred revenue balance that we lost through with retained earnings at the adoption date. So, net-net, no impact to the revenue that's significant. Commissions, however, is a much larger item for us. We do expect that benefit that we talked about of 150 basis points is attributable to the change in how we will recognize commission expense. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Gabriela Borges : Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Ken, over the course of last year, we talked a little bit about under-hiring in the first half and then maybe catching up in the second half. How do you feel the company is today with respect to your hiring plans? And as you look out to 2018, maybe you can just give us directional color on whether you plan - on how you plan to invest in headcount? Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. We catch up some in Q4, and we continue to keeping hiring because the sales capacity, if we can add sales capacity, we have superior product technology, especially the fabric solution is the broadest security solution in the industry. So that definitely will help us to grow. So, we'll continue to invest in the sales capacity. And we catch up some in Q4, but we'll continue to keep on hiring in this quarter. Gabriela Borges : That's helpful. And quick follow-up for Drew. You mentioned the ongoing dynamic where you're seeing duration increase. With billings guidance for fiscal 2018, is there an assumption that, that billings duration should continue to increase? And can you give us some color on how much? Keith Jensen : This is Keith and I'll jump in for Drew on that a little bit, if you don't mind. Yes, I think, obviously, as we continue to push into the enterprise market, our enterprise customers have tended to buy longer-term contracts, be they 2, 3, even 5 years in duration. To the extent that our mix shift continues to move towards the enterprise, I would expect the duration continue to tick up just slightly as we move through the year. And I think we have that in our model. Gabriela Borges : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Gray Powell : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I'm curious, like a number of your peers have seen decelerating product growth over the last couple of years. What do you see is the industry level of product growth going forward? And then have you seen any significant changes in the level of discounting just over the last six months? Thanks. Ken Xie : This is Ken. I think it's a very good question. We don't see the slowdown of the product growth. And also, like probably couple reason. The first one, we're keeping - get a new product. It's a much better performance. Like we announced today, the 6,000 series is really the fastest firewall appliance in the industry with over 100-gig of threat protection, SSL inspection. So, none of the competitor come close. We're keeping, like I said, the new opportunity, replacement opportunity, that's what's helping. The second part, also, the fabric, we have quite a broad solution, which also was helping on the product growth. But also, the longer term of the service, I think 1 year ago, we average about 22 months. I think Q4 is about 26 months. That kind of push up like a few percent of the product revenue into the future service revenue. So, if you count that one in, actually, we don't see much slowdown at all. I think it's - overall, we still see pretty strong growth in product and also the new customer base. Drew Del Matto : Yes. And Gray, this is Drew, just to add on a little bit. The unit shipments continue to grow. And I think this broad mix shift is something that you do see across the industry, as you noted. For us, just more our own, more within Fortinet, what we are seeing is growth in these enterprise bundles were higher-priced and we're selling more 7x24 support. And so, it's not all accounting, so to speak. There's economics supporting the mix shift that end up really on the balance sheet and then appear - reappear in a more profitable stream over time as we do take product costs upfront for anything shipped, any units shipped, and then that revenue comes back margin-free over time. And then on discounting, in most of the geos, it was about the same. We always have some competitive displacement. So, we saw a few of those in North Asia and maybe a few in parts of Europe, but that's really the extent of it. Gray Powell : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your question please. Saket Kalia : Hi guys, thanks for my questions and Drew, congrats on the move. Just two quick accounting questions from my end. First, Drew or Keith, feel free. You talked about strong growth in on-demand consumption of virtual appliances. Could you just remind us how the rev rec there works in terms of going to product or subscription and whether that changes at all with 606? Keith Jensen : Not sure I understand the question exactly, but we certainly - I don't see any difference in how we recognize our product revenue or our service revenue. The service revenue will continue to be recognized over the length of the service contract, the product revenue upfront. Saket Kalia : Well, I was referring specifically to kind of the virtual appliances, so not hardware, but actually, the virtual form factor? Ken Xie : The virtual and cloud, still pretty small percentage. I don't feel they have much impact on that. Keith Jensen : No, you won't notice it. You will not see that in our trends. Drew Del Matto : And then also just, Saket, there's some deferred revenue that washes away given the new accounting. It just goes away. And I think for the year. And Keith, I don't serve to put words in your mouth, but I believe it's pretty much an offset. Keith Jensen : Correct. We have - you're really talking about software licenses that are recognized currently on the subscription model in Q4 that will slip over to the upfront model, but those are fairly small dollars. And you pick up some revenue, yes, in Q1, but you've lost some amortization from the prior licenses in the prior year. That's why net-net it's... Drew Del Matto : Yes. There was some ratable software on the balance sheet. So that goes away. Saket Kalia : Got it. That makes sense. And then maybe for my follow-up, you folks talked about just more product being deferred because of the richer services mix. And we've seen other competitors in this space kind of have the same thing. I guess the question is when do we lap that effect? And the reason why I ask is, just so we can maybe better calibrate when we could stop - maybe we can start - stop seeing that headwind on product and perhaps see a reacceleration if that is in the cards just as that effect kind of laps itself, if you will. Drew Del Matto : Well see, Saket, there's economic reality here or there's economic value being created through the mix shift with higher-priced bundles, like the enterprise bundles, which had a very nice quarter. And that's been the trend since we released those - it feels like a year-and-a-half ago. And the same thing is we ship more into 7x24 services. So, there's a continued shift in the economics as we get into the enterprise customers. And we continue to penetrate that part of the market. This can continue for quite a while. We also see a lot of headroom within our existing customers, not just by acquiring new customers, but we believe we have substantial room to grow in our installed base, upselling not only enterprise bundles, but FortiCare 360 and even higher levels of support going forward. And we'll continue to look at ways to do that. Saket Kalia : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Your question please. Shaul Eyal : Thank you, good afternoon. Congrats, Drew; congrats, Keith; congrats, Peter, on your new promotion. Ken, sales leadership, do you think that from a sales leadership perspective the company is well positioned to continue and execute well within its primary geographies? Ken Xie : Yes. I think we built in not only very strong product technology, also very strong team here. So, that's where in all these different areas we see pretty strong growth potential. And like I said, we are in the best position, the best time to keeping growth. And from my script, you can see in the last few quarter, we grow faster than any of our competitor based on the billing, reported billing, and also mentioned, we - the unit shipment has more than the two-close competitor combined together. So that's where we feel it's good potential Fortinet keeping growth. Shaul Eyal : Got it. So maybe, Ken, while staying on the topic and maybe from a higher level. You're probably aware of the ongoing debate touching on whether firewalls are needed in what is becoming more of a virtual infrastructure arena. What's your thinking about the topic? Is it that the hybrid infrastructure, which is the way to go? Are firewalls gradually disappearing? Is cloud completely taking over? How should we be thinking about it? Ken Xie : I recall in the last few years, I started to see, we go to the third generation of network security. Like I mentioned, when we started Fortinet 17, 18 years ago, we started second generation, moving from a traditional firewall, VPN, which my previous company, NetScreen, are doing for the connection security move to the - we call the application content security, just look at inside the connection, whether through UTM, next-generation firewall. So, that's doing well in the last, like 17, 18 years. I think right now maybe 80% or close to 90% the network security deployment are already using the second generation, but with all the mobile, with all the cloud, with all the IoT, just cover the network no longer enough, so you need to cover the whole infrastructure. So that's what we're starting to call is the third generation, which, including network security, but also need to addressing the cloud, the endpoint, the IoT, the access part, the application, like email and web, altogether. So that I see is a - we started promoting we call the fabric - Fortinet fabric in the last 1 to 2 years. It's a huge potential. The difference about third generation compared to the second generation, really they are not replacing the traditional firewall, that it become part of the solution. So that's where the total addressable market is bigger, but all these security piece need to be working together with network security. Network security is still the biggest in the cybersecurity, but also need to tie together with the cloud, with the endpoint, with the application, email, web, with the access control, like a AP, and also with the IoT going forward. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your question please. Walter Pritchard : Hi. I guess for Keith. On longer-term margin goals, could you - I guess, I didn't hear you necessarily confirm those. We have some accounting impacts and so forth, just wondering how the accounting impact the margin goals in 2020 and then and I guess, beyond that. And then a question for Ken on product. I guess on the fabric, could you maybe help us understand, which products are you most likely seeing bundled into fabric deals? I think some of these markets we're very much hearing best-of-breed purchasing areas like email security or SIEM. Just wondering, which areas are you seeing the most success on a product addition into the fabric deal. Keith Jensen : Walter, this is Keith. And yes, we are still targeting 25% in 2020. That has not changed. Drew Del Matto : 2022. Keith Jensen : 2022, excuse me, 2022, sorry, Drew. The commission impact has got a number of factors that are going into it, and that's why where we end up in 2022 with commissions would be a net change to that number. It's impacted by your mix between product and services. It's impacted by your mix by geography. It's impacted by your growth rate. There's a ton of variables that go into it. So, it's obviously pretty difficult to project that out that far. And I think that's why we're just comfortable stating again that we maintain our targets, and we'll see how the commission number plays out, whether it's accretive or not to that number in the future. Ken Xie : Yes. To answer your fabric, we have like we call the fabric 8. There's a top 8 product actually working together quite well with the FortiGate network security. That's including the email, the web, the endpoint we call the FortiClient, the sandbox and the FortiAP for the WiFi access control and the FortiSIEM and the FortiSwitch. So, I think like Drew also and Keith mentioned, we do win - starting to win some bigger deal that the Number 1 issue facing a lot of enterprise really, there's too many different security products and most of them not even talking or working together. So, the management cost is much higher compared to the money they spend on buying product. So that's where the fabric will help in and address all this issue. And that will tie all this together, not only different application, but also the cloud side, the remote access, the mobile, the IoT going forward. So, we see a huge potential and also the benefit to the enterprise customer to using this fabric infrastructure approach compared to just the network side. So, that's why we mentioned the fabric grow faster - the non-FortiGate grow faster than the FortiGate. And right now, it's kind about a quarter of our business, but we do see that part like grow like 25% in Q4. Drew Del Matto : Yes. And Walter, it's Drew. And I'm just trying to - I think I'm going to clarify here what Keith was saying is that the 25% was before ASC 606. And so, what he was trying to describe was you get a benefit in the early years, but in some years, it may turn around. It may turn around later. And so, it's too early to really say what that would be, but the 25% is really based pre-ASC 606, which is consistent with what we were saying in the past. Keith, is that correct? Keith Jensen : Absolutely. Drew Del Matto : And that's why they broke it out when they did the guidance. If you look at the annual guidance in the quarter, they gave two numbers. They gave a baseline and then they gave the benefit, I believe, which was at least 150 bps, both in Q1 and for the year the way they did so you could track it. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. Drew Del Matto : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Tal Liani : Hi guys. Just one clarification first. If you - I still didn't get what's the impact of 606 rule on your financials, if you can discuss it. And then I have two kind of bigger questions, not about the quarter. The first one is, if I go back to your roots and your focus on appliances and your strength with smaller accounts, how is SD-WAN not hurting you over the long run and all the services that branch off the service offerings - security service offerings that are cloud-based rather than appliance-based? The second question is related to that, and this is kind of at the higher level, and I think someone asked it in a different way, and I'll ask it in a simple way without getting into the details. What are the impact of cloud migration? What's the impact of cloud migration on your business given that you're very associated with high-performance, hardware-based acceleration, et cetera? Are you getting hurt or not getting hurt by cloud migration? Thanks. And I ask it - on purpose, I ask it in a very general form. Thanks. Drew Del Matto : Accounting goes first. Keith Jensen : So, to clarify, for the revenue portion of 606, we see no significant impact in our revenue trends. Our revenue recognition model in terms of the results will look very much the same. On the commission side, we see a significant impact, where previously, we had charged to expense commissions on our hardware and services contracts and sales at the time of sale. Going forward, we will continue to charge to expense the commissions related to hardware, but for a portion of the service contracts, they will be deferred and amortized over an extended number of years. That extended number of years, I would estimate to be 4 to 6 years at this point. We'll have a final number for you in our Q1 call. You're going to see us put in the call that we are going to push out certain commission expenses that some of our competitors have already done by capitalizing them and deferring them. But at the transition day - too much accounting - we're going to capitalize an asset on the balance sheet of about $150 million related to prior commissions that will then be amortized over that period of time I described. So, you'll have a drag from the amortization of that asset and a benefit from the push of the deferral of new deals. The net effect of that is about 150 - is at least 150 basis points of improved margin in Q1 and in 2018. Ken Xie : Let me address your question. But before that, I think there's two things Fortinet different than all of our competitors, right? So, the first one, we're the only one building our own ASIC chip. So that's why you look in the network security, at FortiGate, we are using our own ASIC plus the best CPUs and [indiscernible] one. That gave us a much better performance and also lower the cost. So that's also making us like the Number 1 in the units shipped. So, we have more units shipped than the next two competitor combined in the network security space. So, none of our competitor have, as we are investing into the chip level, we call the SPU, gave the best performance and also much better cost in the industry. The second differentiation is really, we also build very broad security solution, we call the fabric. No other competitor has so broad solution. Also, most of them very internally developed growth from day one, making them working together. So, some of our competitor keeping buying different product, different solution and try to put it together, but we build it internally day one, making it working together. So, that's also differentiates us from our other competitor. So, for your question, like SD-WAN, there's a few SD-WAN player in the industry right now, but the current SD-WAN solutions are very low cost. They lack the computing power to address any security issue. So, they don't have any computing power to address all this security computing needed. I believe SD-WAN need to be integrated just like AP need to be integrated with network security and security is a very important part going forward. So that's where we have huge advantage because our solution combined with the SPU ASIC, which has huge computing advantage, computing power performance advantage compared any other SD-WAN solution. Also, for the cloud, we do have all the major cloud provider working with us. We have the best cloud solution. We see that grow also very fast. But also, just cloud is not enough. You still need to address the network side, the endpoint side, the application side, the IoT side. So that's why we say cloud is one of the growth engine we identify. We have 4 growth engines.  So, the network security's still keeping growing, still the biggest market in cybersecurity, and then go beyond that, it's the fabric, cover additional endpoint, the access part, the email application, web application, the FortiSIEM, and then the cloud, it grow very fast, but a little bit small base right now. And then IoT has even more great potential going forward. We don't see any of our competitor really addressing that. And also, just in the last month, in the CES show, we are probably the only security company, we demonstrate how to secure the connected car using our solution. So, that's also a huge potential going forward. Tal Liani : Got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your question please. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one for Keith. Keith, as we think about the size of your installed base, you have a pretty latent opportunity in terms of refreshing that base. So, as your portfolio has expanded and you've invested in and around the fabric messaging, can you help us understand what refresh trend you're seeing and the cadence of refresh you're seeing in your base relative to historical trends? And then a quick follow-up. Ken Xie : Yes. Like I mentioned, there's three opportunity : the new opportunity and then the displacement and also the adjacent market like SD-WAN. For the refresh, like I said, every 4, 5 years, the network security hardware need to be refreshed. So, we see the last cycle happen in like 2014, 2015 in our discussions because somehow the Moore's Law still apply every 18 to 24 months. The speed need to be double. And also, the network security tend to be 100x slower and about 100x more costly - 100% throughput compared to the network in routing and switching. So, that's what's continue to apply the rules, continue to apply in this going forward. So, we do see the refreshing cycle happen every 4, 5 years for the enterprise customer or even for SMB in this industry. And then that's why whoever can come up a better performance and the additional function, lower the cost, who has advantage. We believe we are the only one can go to the chip level, has huge advantage on the performance and the cost with a refresh and then add additional computing power just like some other GPU, TPU can address in some separate space. It's a huge advantage. It's a 7-to-8-year advantage on the performance on the cost compared to the software on a general-purpose CPU, most of the competitor do. And then also for the refresh, a lot of times the Number 1 issue enterprise customer facing is too many different products. And they are not talking. They're not working together. So that's the fabric also come in. So, we see a lot of deal, a lot of big enterprises, they need to address how the network security can - working together with endpoint, with the cloud, with other like email, with web security, with their WiFi access, with all the switch and also a - so a lot of thing need to be working together because the management cost is still the highest cost among all this enterprise security. It's not really the product; it's how to provide better management. So that's the fabric where we help address it. We not only develop our own kind of a very broad fabric solution, but also, we have very broad partner, like I mentioned, pretty much all the major networking company, the software company, the database company, the cloud company is our partner. This is the broadest partner program in the industry, making all this fabric working together. So, we have a 37 eco partner, including today, this morning, we announced with Google Cloud. Fatima Boolani : That's really helpful, Ken. Thank you. And Keith, a quick follow-up for you. Any guideposts you can share around how we should think about cash flow? And you've historically been a modest cash taxpayer and with the rate coming down, if you can help us sort of wade through that and provide some guideposts on cash flow, that would be really helpful? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. As you know, we don't guide on free cash flow, but having said that, in terms of cash paid for taxes, you can compare 2017, we paid $32 million. We project $40 million to $44 million in cash paid for taxes in 2018. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your question please. Ken Talanian : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I think you've previously talked about seeing margins expand about 150 to 200 basis points from 2017 and beyond. And I believe that was without the impact of 606, but your current guidance seems to suggest less expansion and I was wondering what might be driving that change? Drew Del Matto : Ken, this is Drew. And when we did it, the 150 to 200 was off 2016 guidance, which at the time would have been 16.2% for 2017. So, we're on track. If you go 150 up, that's 17.70% to 18% would get you in that range, I think, pretty easily. Ken Xie : Yes. Also, like I mentioned, we're a little bit behind our hiring last year, especially the sales. So, we started the setup in - towards end of Q3, Q4. That's starting to catch up. But also, we believe with the best product in the industry and if we can add additional sales capacity, plus the fabric expanded market opportunity, we definitely can grow faster than the market, keep on gaining market share. Ken Talanian : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. As we are coming to the end of the hour. Our final question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in and congrats, Drew, and everybody else over at Fortinet. My first question for Ken. Ken, it's nice to see that you've now got all the major public clouds covered with the GCP announcement today. Can you maybe talk a bit about, architecturally, how the virtual product compares with physical product if the public clouds themselves don't expose the lower layers of the OSI stack? And when we think about cloud and virtual product, how much of that is really being run in the public cloud versus customers using virtual editions of the product in their own virtualized networks? Ken Xie : Yes. It's good question. We do have the best software, which also the Forti SPU help accelerate that. So that's where I feel the cloud, you need to have both side working together. And the same time, even some cloud provider, they recognize it's very expensive to run on some of the security function in a general-purpose CPU, right? So that's where - there's like a - the purpose-built, chip-level solution can really help in accelerate the performance, also lower the cost, but also some cloud, they want to have certain flexibility. So, basically, based on our very broad approach, the huge installation base and also the combination of the fabric part, and - we see is a huge advantage compared to our competitor, which like where they play in the network security or in the cloud space. And that's where the fabric, we feel, is much better approach compared to the traditional, whether on the network side or just on the cloud side. You do see - if you only compare on the general-purpose CPU running on the cloud, there's probably not much differentiation, but with acceleration of the ASIC and acceleration of the broad fabric approach and combined together, that's a much better position, advantage compared to our competitor. So, that's why I do believe going forward even a cloud provider itself need to address how to increase the performance, also lower the cost of the cloud security computing they're facing right now, especially, like I mentioned, like today is the 6,000 announcement. They can address like a 100-gig throughput of SSL inspection. That's all the cloud provider also needed. This is the highest-performed appliance. And I specifically mentioned in the script, it's addressing the transition to the cloud because all the cloud provider and also for enterprise customer and the end user, they also need to have a secured access to the cloud data, which SSL encryption is a major part of it. Brad Zelnick : Thank you, Ken, that's very helpful context. And if I could just slip one in for Keith or perhaps Drew. If I look at your slide deck and I go to the slide on the ASC 606 impact, I appreciate that the comments suggest that there really isn't any material change to revenue recognition, but if you look at the shift from selling through to selling into the channel in 2018 under 606, it makes me wonder. Is there even a timing benefit or headwind in selling into the channel? And as it relates to that, can you just maybe remind us on your inventory policy as we think about what sits out there in the channel? Keith Jensen : Historically, we do not put a lot of inventory in the U.S. channel. It's not been a significant dollar amount. And I don't know that we would expect to see a significant change in that regard related to 6 - due to 606 in the first quarter. I think you can check our financial statements and see our inventory in the channel. Drew Del Matto : I think he's also - Brad's also asking if there's an impact from - to the sell-in basis. Brad, not to ask a question for you, but\u2026 Brad Zelnick : No, no, that is the essence of the question though. As you go from sell-through to sell-in, I would think that there's a bit of a timing benefit. And also, the related question as well, does it relate to billings or is it only impactful to revenue, even if a small impact? Keith Jensen : I think it pretty much offsets in the quarter the amount of revenue - the amount of inventory we expect to put into the channel in the U.S. is pretty much offset by the revenue that we lose from deferred revenue coming in due to the change. Drew Del Matto : So, it's not a material impact. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Peter Salkowski for any further remarks. Peter Salkowski : Great. Thank you. As a reminder, we will hold a second conference call at 3 :30 Pacific Time this afternoon. The dial-in information for that call is on our Investor Relations website to do a Q&A session. I'd like to thank everyone for your interest in Fortinet and have a good day. Operator, this includes the fourth quarter and 2017 earnings call. Operator : Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Salkowski - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Takira. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, at Fortinet. I am pleased to welcome you to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, our CFO. This is a live call that is available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website.

As for the presentation, the last slide summarizes the impact to the accounting change to ASC 606 with regard to the first quarter results. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thanks, Peter, and thank you for everyone for joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2018 results. Once again, we demonstrate our market leadership by our strong first quarter performance. In the quarter, billings were up 15% to $463 million and the revenue was up 17% to $399 million, both above the high-end of our guidance. We continue to invest to fuel our above-market growth, especially in sales and marketing, while remaining focused on improving profitability. During the quarter, we hosted our first-ever Financial Analyst Day, together with Accelerate, our global partner and customer conference. The event provided us with a forum to review the strong performance of our financial model as well as highlight our significant opportunities for growth with our Security Fabric architecture. The feedback we received from both analysts and the investors were extremely positive. An important message we conveyed during the Financial Analyst Day was the evolution of network security in this period of digital transformation. Fortinet pioneered and lead the current generation of UTM and next-gen firewall network security and is pioneering and leading the new generation of network security, which we refer to as the third-generation. The third-generation of network security, which is the Security Fabric, is in the early stage and delivers integrated protection and detection across the entire digital attack surface. We expect that this evolution will drive growth within our installed base and also with new customers. In the first quarter, our core FortiGate network security business account for three-quarter of the billings. This market-leading network security business is driven by our unmatched security functionality and performance of our highly-differentiated FortiASIC technology, Security Processing Unit, SPU. Developing customized ASIC to enhance application performance is a growing trend among leading technology companies, such as NVIDIA with its GPU and Google with its TPU ASIC. FortiOS 6.0 was released in Q1 and is the most widely deployed network security operation system in the market. It is the central building block for the latest evolution of a Fortinet Security Fabric, as well as applications such as IoT, SD-WAN and hybrid cloud security. Billings for our non-FortiGate part of our Fabric grow faster than our FortiGate business and accounted for a quarter of the billings. The Fortinet Security Fabric delivers a broad and widely-integrated and automated security solution for enterprise worldwide, offering huge opportunity for growth. Additionally, cloud security continues to be a faster growing part of our business. We work with all of the major cloud providers and will continue to expand our Fabric offering for multi-cloud environments. As of Q1, the Security Fabric is fully available within AWS environments. During the quarter, we announced 11 new Fabric-Ready partners, including Arista, IBM, McAfee, ServiceNow, and VMware. To-date, Fortinet has 43 Fabric-Ready partners which further expands our Security Fabric across the hybrid cloud. The transition into the third-generation of network security expected to drive our growth as well as market share gains in the next few years. We continue to balance the investment to make sure Fortinet remain a technology and market leader while improving our operating margin as we work towards our goal of achieving our long-term operating margin target of 25% by 2022. Now, before I turn the call over for a review of our first quarter financial result, I would like to congratulate Keith Jensen for being appointed by our board of directors to be our Chief Financial Officer. Congratulations, Keith. I will now turn the call over to you for a close look on our first quarter performance and our second quarter and full year guidance. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. I look forward to working with you and the entire Fortinet team. I also appreciate the support of the board and the Fortinet Executive Team. Now, turning to the quarter. I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Revenues, margins and earnings per share all performed well. We've posted strong year-over-year billings growth and we repurchased over $100 million of stock. Security remains a growing industry and we are well-positioned to outpace the market. Our product portfolio, geographic diversity, and our mission to deliver the most innovative and highest-performing network Security Fabric in the industry places us in a strong leadership position. We remain committed to achieving above-industry growth, improving profitability and, as Ken mentioned, achieving our non-GAAP operating margin goal of 25% by 2022. Now, for our first quarter results, starting with revenue. Revenue grew 17% to $399 million driven by service revenue growth of 25% to $256 million. As a reminder, we provide two subscription-based services attached to most of our product sales. Our traditional support offering, FortiCare, generated first quarter revenue of $110 million, up 35%. And our security subscription offering, FortiGuard, generated revenue of $137 million, up 20%. Consistent with my commentary at the Analyst Day regarding predictability, existing deferred revenue accounted for 60% of our first quarter revenue. In the first quarter, deferred revenue itself grew to $1.4 billion, up 27%. Our mix of short-term and long-term deferred revenue was consistent quarter-over-quarter at 59% current and 41% long-term. In the first quarter, product revenue was $143 million versus $135 million in the year earlier period. Product revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included a $5.7 million benefit from the change to 606 accounting. We expect a similar to smaller impact to revenue throughout the rest of 2018. The average contract length decreased sequentially one month to 25 months in the first quarter. FortiGate unit shipments increased 20% year-over-year. As you can see on slides 5 and 6, we remain a geographically diversified business. First quarter revenue for the Americas represented 44% of our business and grew 20%. EMEA represented 36% of our business and grew 15%. APAC represented 20% of our business and grew 16%. Now, turning to billings. First quarter billings of $463 million grew 15%, solid growth despite a difficult year-earlier comp due to an eight-figure deal in the first quarter of 2017. We saw continued growth in both enterprise and UTM service bundles during the quarter. The Security Fabric and cloud continued to outpace our growth. And the Security Fabric, which is the largest component of our non-FortiGate offerings, benefited from customers' recognition of its value, performance and comprehensive security coverage. Our enterprise successes in the quarter included a mid-seven figure renewal and cross-sell deal with a major U.S. technology company. The cross-sell component was a competitive displacement using our Advanced Threat Protection element of the Security Fabric, providing stronger integration and effectiveness against an existing point solution. Further, our licensing model provided the customer with the ongoing choice of appliance or cloud deployments. Regarding cloud billings, while the billings are relatively small versus the rest of the business, we experienced triple-digit growth in both on-demand cloud consumption and bring-your-own-license. Across our cloud partners, AWS continues to be the leader with contributions coming from Azure. Oracle, Google and IBM, each came online with initial billings during the first quarter. Bring-your-own-license growth was fueled by five and six-figure engagements across the major cloud providers, along with a seven-figure cloud engagement with a large enterprise U.S. retailer. Let's now turn to the breakdown of our billings across our top five verticals in mid-enterprise and enterprise markets. Service providers accounted for 20% of billings, followed by government at 14%, financial services at 11%, retail at 9%, and education at 7%. The billings breakdown by vertical, as well as the percentage of billings coming from the top five verticals, is consistent with the average of the last 10 quarters. On a geographic basis, billings in the Americas grew 11%, EMEA billings grew 21%, and APAC billings were up 13%. The number of deals over $50,000 grew 20%, illustrating the continued strength of our network security business among small and medium-size enterprise. Meanwhile, the number of deals over $1 million were up 21%, demonstrating growth in our enterprise business. Looking at our top 25 customer billings, which were all over $1 million, we saw a pattern similar to prior quarters. These billings showed a predictable balance across business verticals and geographies, with a slight uptick in the Americas. The top two deals were mid-seven-figure deals in the EMEA carrier group. In the first quarter, we saw customer billings weighted towards renewals in line with our seasonal pattern. Returning to the income statement, our first quarter gross margin was up year-over-year from 74.5% to 76.7% or 2.1 points. Our product gross margin was consistent with the prior-year at about 60%, while service's gross margins expanded 1.6 points to 86%. Our gross margin remains strong due to the mix shift in our revenue to higher margin, more predictable subscription services, providing a tailwind to longer term gross margins. Excluding a benefit of $11.7 million from the new accounting standards and how it impacted commissions, total first quarter operating expenses were up 17% to $247 million. The increase in operating expenses was driven by a $7 million headwind from FX and a 16.8% increase in sales and marketing. Hiring in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 was a significant driver of the increased operating expenses. Since September 30, 2017, the head count for sales and marketing has increased 12%. As we've mentioned previously, we continued investing in sales capacity in order to fuel growth. However, our goal remains to balance it with near-term and long-term profit goals. That said, we are now entering a phase of more normalized head count activity. Including a benefit of approximately 390 basis points associated with the 606 accounting change, the first quarter operating margin was 17.7%, up 510 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the 390 basis points benefit, the first quarter operating margin would have been 13.8%. This is 130 basis points higher than the midpoint of our 12% to 13% guidance range under the old accounting rules. The upside in operating margin is due to strong gross margin performance resulting from slightly better-than-expected revenue growth and the mix shift discussed a moment ago. Please refer to the last slide in the earnings deck, where we've posted on our Investor Relations website this afternoon a line by line comparison between our non-GAAP results and our non-GAAP results excluding the impact of 606. For the remainder of 2018, we now expect the operating margin benefit from 606 to be around 250 basis points. Net income for the first quarter was $57 million or $0.33 per share based on approximately 172 million diluted shares. Excluding the full 606 benefit, our first quarter earnings per share would have been $0.26 versus our guidance of $0.21 to $0.22, with the upside attributable to better-than-expected margin performance. As expected, the annualized non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. Slides 8 and 9 review our balance sheet and provide more information for your reference on our cash flow. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $1.4 billion in cash and investments. During the quarter, we repatriated $130 million of overseas cash. We expect to be able to repatriate an additional $150 million over the remainder of 2018. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $80 million. Inventory turns were 2.4 times, up from 1.6 times in the year-earlier period and above our average of approximately 2.2 times. Cash from operations was $140 million, representing growth of 8%. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $128 million, up 10%. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $12 million. Second quarter capital expenditures should be between $25 million and $30 million. Construction of our new headquarters is expected to start in the third quarter. We estimate 2018 spending on this project to be approximately $20 million to $30 million, occurring mostly in the second half of the year. Capital expenditures for all of 2018 are expected to be $85 million to $100 million. In the first quarter, we returned $115.5 million to our shareholders to the repurchase of 2.5 million shares for Fortinet stock. As of March 31, 2018, approximately $327 million remain in share repurchase authorization for the plan that expires in January 2019. We believe share repurchase is a good method for returning value to our shareholders and expect to continue this practice. Now turning to guidance. First, I'd like to remind everyone of the forward-looking disclaimer Peter presented at the start of the call and how it applies to the guidance specifically that I'm about to provide. In the second quarter, guidance including the benefit of 606, we expect billings in the range of $485 million to $495 million, revenue in the range of $420 million to $430 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margins of 18.5% to 19%. This guidance includes an operating margin benefit of 200 basis points from 606. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.36, which again includes the benefit of $0.05 from 606, and assumes a share count of 173 million to 175 million. For 2018, the full year, including the benefit of 606, we expect billings in the range of $2.040 billion to $2.065 billion, revenue in the range of $1.715 billion to $1.735 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 20.2% to 20.7%. This includes an operating margin benefit of 250 basis points from 606. Non-GAAP tax rate is still at 24%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.51 to $1.55, which includes a benefit of $0.19 from ASC 606 and assumes a share count of 175 million to 177 million. Slide 12 on the earnings slide deck, I referenced a moment ago, contains a summary of our guidance for the second quarter and for the full year. And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Peter. Peter Salkowski - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Keith. We are ready to open the call for questions. Again, as a reminder, just please keep your questions brief as we're trying to get through as many of you can in the next 40 minutes. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the strong performance and guidance. Congrats, Keith, on the promotion. Great work across-the-board when even excluding the 606 impact. Great work on deferred revenue; up nicely year-over-year. My question is on EMEA, another set of strong results. In your case, is the GDPR specifically or is it the ongoing good execution, demand environment, pricing, all of the above? How would you characterize that? Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Shaul, it's Ken. Good questions. I think it's a combination of both. We always had strong team in EMEA and also GDPR also help. And compared to some other region, the EMEA team's pretty long-term stable, they're keeping doing quite well. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you for that. I'll step aside this time. Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your line is now open. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you for taking the questions. A quick one for Ken. Ken, 2017 marked a year in which you saw a sort of divergent strength in the carrier vertical whereas international was strong, domestic was weak. I was wondering what sort of trends you're seeing in 2018? And then a quick follow up for Keith around large deal. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned a ton of large deal momentum both on the new product side as well as renewal side. Can you help us walk through sort of how you discount large deal and large deal momentum in your guidance? And that's it for me, thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay. I think the carrier service provider space are usually in a stabilized \u2013 starting to recover, but not quite there yet. And especially international, they're a little bit ahead of Americans here, U.S. And also kind of a little bit related to the previous question Shaul asked, because our top two deals come from the Europe service provider, carrier space, that's also kind of helping both in Europe \u2013 in the carrier space a lot. But if you compare it to year-over-year, it's pretty much on a percentage-wise pretty much flat. So I'd say it's still a lot of opportunity. And also, we launched a new product, high-end, more targeted at carrier, the big service provider, the big enterprise account, which also takes some time because it tend to be long-sales cycle. That's also kind of where we say, we need some time to ramp up. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, Fatima. Good question. To really get to the quick of it, we look at large deals. We split large deals between the U.S. and the rest of the world. It's a larger population oftentimes in the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world. And so we want to kind of bifurcate that when we look at our forecasting and guidance setting process. We look at our historical rates of number of deals, the dollar value associated with those deals and our historical close rates, and then we have conversations with the key salespeople that are involved to get a sense of where we should be with our expected close rates in the current quarter as we set our guidance. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Very helpful, and congratulations on the formal appointment. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Just want a little help reconciling, I think Keith you mentioned unit volumes were up 20%, yet billings up 15%. How much of the difference was mix which you talked about, how much was duration, and were there any other factors to bridge the two growth rates? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I think the \u2013 we're very pleased with the 20% growth in our unit shipments. Right? That provides a footprint for us to continue to sell services. So first and foremost, that's very attractive. I think when you look at the mix year-over-year, what we did not have was the large high-end deal in the first quarter of 2018 that we had in the first quarter of 2017. And so, when you look at the mix between high-end, low-end and mid-range, we saw more low-end in the quarter than we did a year-ago. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And then... Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No. Go ahead, sorry. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I see, that's the one single deal, eight-digit, one year ago, pretty much all high-end and also in the last few quarters we launched 6000, new 7000, which also take a little bit long time to sell because there's a bigger kind of carrier. And that's also contributed to some of the high-end percentage a little bit lower. But we do see as a more competitive product, which we feel confidence will keeping and gaining share also in high end later. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That makes sense. And then Keith one more, just working capital impact on cash flow in the quarter? I think cash from operations may have been down or flattish year-over-year. What was happening in working capital and what should we expect as we look to the full year on the cash from operations side? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: We don't typically model to free cash flow or operating cash flow. Our recollection was that it was up slightly 8% on operating cash flow year-over-year, so we feel good about that. I think I've spoken previously that some of the large drivers in addition to, obviously, earnings, monitoring inventory changes, deferred revenue and such are among the large drivers as you go-forward to model it. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Keith, on the outlook for the full year, you mentioned the elevated hiring in 4Q and 1Q. Just curious how you're thinking about the productivity of those folks ramping? And how you're incorporating that? Or thinking about what that could mean for guidance in the second half? The follow-up is for Ken on SD-WAN technology. What we tend to see with communications technology is that they take multiple years to ramp. So the question is, are you starting to see SD-WAN come up in more conversations? And how does your solution compare to something like a Zscaler or a Cisco? What do you think about the competitive environment there? Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, Gabriela. Thank you very much for the question. Yeah, I think the \u2013 we would expect and we're modeling seasonality in the current year that's not inconsistent with what we've seen in earlier years. I think that's one part of your question. The second part I think was productivity, and I would say I feel very comfortable with the required productivity level based upon the current head count and the net head count planning as we go forward for the rest of the year. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: For the question related to the SD-WAN and the other cloud-related player and also like Cisco, we have SD-WAN fully integrated into the FortiOS, which we have one box. They offer both the security, the SD-WAN, the other, like Wi-Fi access, the other network function, access function like Wi-Fi, all these things. It's different than the other vendors. They have to use multiple boxes because today's SD-WAN offering \u2013 they don't have a processing power, don't have a computing power to do any securities in there. So that's a huge advantage to the customer. And also different compared to some cloud providers which \u2013 SD-WAN is ready. The benefits will come from the branch office and a lot of big deployment for the service provider. And that's where it's a huge benefit, if they can integrate together with the security function with other network and access function together. So that's where we see a lot of advantage and a lot of interest, a lot more trial from the field. So we do believe we're leading this space, and we'll benefit a lot from this well integrated and automated approach. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you for the color. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much, and, Keith, congratulations on the appointment. I had two, and I'll just ask them at once. First, Keith, for you, you indicated that the 606 benefit to revs, which is in the \u2013 thank you very much for the helpful chart \u2013 was about $6 million or a little bit over, all-in. I think you said it was less going forward, but I just want to see if you could clarify pursuant to the top line guidance that you provided for 2018 what the benefit is? Again, you've been very helpful in providing the operating income and EPS, but just want a little bit of granularity on the top line. And the second, Ken, is for you. When we gathered in Vegas a few months ago, you were talking about the margins post this year, and you were going to take some investor feedback on the dilemma or challenge or opportunity of pursuing more market share versus the margins. And I just want to see if you had any additional comments pursuant to any feedback you might have gotten. My take from the call, you sounded positive on certainly reaching the milestone that you've established for 2022 of 25%, but I just want to see if you wanted to offer any follow-up color. That's it for me. Thanks very much. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, Keith. Thank you for your comments. So don't want to make too much of accounting granularity, but two things that impact us really on the revenue line for 606. One is some time-based software licenses revenue, and that's the kind of the small item that we continue to see benefit from the rest of the year. The second change was how we recognized revenue in the U.S. market. Previously, we were on a sell-in basis \u2013 probably sell-through basis... Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: ...and we are now on a sell-in basis. And so that change probably lifted revenue about $4 million in the quarter, and I would not expect that one-time change, even in small numbers \u2013 I would not expect to see that one-time type change again in future quarters. That's why I'm guiding a lower impact on the revenue line going forward. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That $4 million was part of the $6 million, Keith? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Like I said, I kind of repeat the target of a 25% margin by 2022 in my script there, but also we see the market opportunity. I think probably in the next one or two years you will see some refreshing cycle come up, and we do believe \u2013 we kind of in the last couple quarters, we add additional hiring effort and catch up the hiring shortfall we have in the early part of last year. And so, we do add sales capacity, but at the same time we also want to improve in the productivity and also make sure the efficiency is also there. So that's where we try to balance around this, too. So the end goal is the same. We may try to leave a little bit room on the way to reach there. But as we also depend on the market condition, the product launching and other things we're doing within the company, but the goal is the same. We want to reach 25% operating margin in the next three years, but also we still try to balance among both the growth and also the profitability in the margin. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you, Ken. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Melissa Franchi of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Melissa Gorham Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Ken, you mentioned 20% unit growth, but I'm just wondering if you could characterize to what extent is that coming from the refresh of your existing base or is there greenfield opportunity? And then when the customer refreshes an appliance, is there any way to think about the additional spend that they are spending with Fortinet, either through a bigger appliance or spending additional around the services? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think the high end take a little bit more time to close the deal because we launch the high end 6000, 7000 in the last few quarters. So that's where the percentage comes from high end, a little bit lower, but the total unit growth 20% above the billing growth of 15%. A lot of come from \u2013 the help come from whether \u2013 I think we're starting to have the SD-WAN function in 5.6, which is the FortiOS we launched almost two years ago. And then the FortiOS 6.0, keeping hands in that. That's also drive a lot of branch office deployment of other interest on the field. So that's we're helping drive a lot of like SMBs. Some low end unit growth in there, but we do believe the high end will keep coming back after maybe a couple quarters once the customer, like, fully evaluate the benefit of the high end unit. And also some time the carrier, service provider and the big account also take a little bit long time to close the deal. So the unit base more drive by the low end side is above average. Melissa Gorham Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up for Keith. I just wanted to hear your views on continued return of cash now that you're repatriating cash throughout 2018, and how investors should think about the use of cash across buy backs versus potential M&A? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thanks, Melissa. I think we've talked before that, in Q1, we said we thought we'd be aggressive in our buy back approach. And you should expect to \u2013 I would offer the same commentary that I expect Q2, as we move through the year, to be consistent with Q1, if that's what you're looking for. I think our overall strategy... Melissa Gorham Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Instead of just balancing relative to M&A? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I think we continue to have a history of looking at tuck-ins as we build-out the Fabric. I don't sense a change of that in the last couple of months. We continue to be very, very proud with our organic approach to building out our fully-integrated product suite. We continue to believe that there is significant benefit from that methodology and we're very happy with it. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also, for the unit growth, based on the IDC data, we almost have 30% of total global deployment. And in some region, countries like APAC, we almost have more than half of the deployment is really the Fortinet product. And we do expect to keep gaining share. I hope in a few years we can have a global, more than 50% of global deployment really of FortiGate product. And that's also keeping driving by the new ASIC come up later this year and also the new FortiOS 6.0 which also adds a lot of function, like SD-WAN, helping driving the additional growth. Melissa Gorham Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is now open. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here and congrats as well to you, Keith, on the permanent seat. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you very much. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Maybe just to start with you, Keith. Can you just talk a little bit about the cloud security part of the business? I think you said it's the fastest-growing part of the business, but can you talk about how much of that was maybe coming from new customers versus existing? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Don't know that \u2013 so we would have probably three key elements to the cloud, when we talk about cloud, when we talk about on-demand or pay-as-you-go as we call it, when we talk about BYOL, and when we also talk about on-prem or hybrid clouds. I don't know \u2013 obviously, the on-demand, I couldn't speak to the source of new customers or existing customers and I really don't have color in terms of new logos versus existing logos on BYOL or hybrid or on-prem. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Overall, I would say, I'm very, very excited about the cloud opportunity, particularly with them all coming online now, understanding they have somewhat different models sometimes. You may have some that are more focused on on-demand, others that are maybe focused on leveraging their current customer or client base and more of a BYOL model. But there's a lot of exciting things happening in the cloud for us. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Keith mentioned in the earnings script that cloud is a triple-digit growth. But also besides cloud, we also leading and see strong growth potential in the IoT, OT space. So we demonstrate at Analyst Day that connected car security and a lot of IoT, OT security also, we're starting to see a lot of potential going forward. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I would just come back to the one example we gave in my text earlier. It was an existing customer but we also use that opportunity to displace a competitor and we would call that a hybrid cloud-type of a situation. The total universe remains small but that was very noticeable and very positive for us. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I'll also mentioned in the AWS, we offered a full Fabric in the cloud environment and that's not only the network security but also from like email, from the web, from the rough analysis, from order management and endpoints. So there's just a lot of Fabric approach in the cloud environment. I think we have the most broad solution and that's really the Fabric approach also doing well in the cloud environment. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, Ken, that's actually a great segue to my follow up for you. I know that we said the non-FortiGate business is still about 25% of total, but could you just talk about your conversations with customers, and just anecdotally, how willing are they to consolidate perhaps some of their security vendors and adopt other parts of the Fabric outside of FortiGate? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think so far we're leading, gaining share based on the \u2013 most come from FortiGate but then the advantage we have without other part of Fabric integrated together, that's has huge advantage because the number one issue the customers are facing today is really the management costs are very high. And on the big enterprise, average they have to deal with 20 to 30 different security vendors and most of them don't even connect or talk to each other which making the Fabric, we call the, infrastructure security defenses more difficult. If you cannot integrate, you cannot automate a defense, you cannot make all these different part of infrastructure working together to defend an attack. So that's the huge advantage of the Fabric. Not only just our own product but also the Fabric-Ready program I mentioned. We have a 43 Fabric-Ready partner that's also make sure is \u2013 all different part of the infrastructure, can talk to each other. So Fortinet product have all the API to integrate with other different partners also. So this approach we see huge advantage and the lowered management costs make it more secure, more automate to defense, so that's where the enterprise like it a lot. So we do see a huge potential going forward, both within our own product, which we tend to build from the beginning to integrate, automate together and also working with our partner products. So it grows faster than the FortiGate and also it's a huge opportunity to up-sell, cross-sell our installation base. Like I mentioned, we have almost 30% global deployment on a unit base, which also gives us huge base to potentially grow from the current base and then the new opportunity mostly comes from enterprise. We also see a lot of potential there. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gray Powell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Gray Wilson Powell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just at the industry level, how do you feel about the pace of appliance or products revenue growth in 2018 versus 2017? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I feel the market condition probably improving a little bit. And like I mentioned, every four or five years the refresh cycle comes up. The last refresh cycle comes from like a 2013, 2014. At that time, it mostly comes from, we call, the current generation UTM, next-gen firewall replacing the traditional firewall. And now we see the new refresh come in, and I would rather say this is the new generation using the infrastructure Fabric approach, which connect from the network side to the endpoint to the cloud to the access to the application like email/web together to defend, replacing just the network security only. So that's where we feel this is a new trend and it just started and may take a few years to, even for some \u2013 both the customer partner to realize the benefit of this infrastructure protection approach. But I do believe this is quite an opportunity to refresh, to accelerate some of the growth, both in appliance and also in the cloud environment because the Fabric do include in the cloud, which is a part of the infrastructure. So that's kind of in addition to the traditional appliance, which also needed in a lot of CPM environment and also in a lot of branch office, also in the high quality data center. Gray Wilson Powell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And then you... Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Sorry, Gray. This is Keith again. I would just add to that again, 20% unit shipment growth year-over-year, and I think we've been talking about that for a couple quarters now on our calls. Yeah, I'm excited about the shipment growth, and I'm not \u2013 don't concerned about whether it shows up in product or services longer term. We just want to continue to have our footprint with our customers and the opportunity to continue to add more services to them. Gray Wilson Powell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then you actually hit on my follow up, which is, I mean, 2014 it was a really good year for you guys after the Target breach. Are you starting to see that refresh activity hitting now or should we expect that coming in the next, call it, 6, 12, 18 months? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: It's customer study evaluate. It is not like last time that they're rushed to buy because they feel bigger case make a lot of customer concern. But this time because every four, five years the hardware tend to get too slow and then lack of the additional performance or function. So the customer starting to do some evaluation, but they're not like last time they're like more rushed to buy upgrade, but this time they probably may take some time. But also the Fabric approach they all like it, they also starting evaluate whether the network part can working with other part of infrastructure. So that's where probably a sales cycle take a little bit longer, not like last time that the news drive some of the decision, but this time they are pretty carefully evaluate and see what's the true benefit. But definitely the hardware, just like any other networking gear or server, after a few years they need to be upgraded. Gray Wilson Powell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Okay. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is now open. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, just a question on Q2 margins. It looks like you are guiding them down year-over-year relative to if I look at it ex 606. And I'm just wondering if we think about where the additional spending is going and I guess maybe kind of longer term where you think you have the most leverage between sales and marketing and R&D on driving top line growth by spending? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I don't know that we think we're guiding down sequentially on margins from... Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I'm sorry, just year-over-year it looks like the margins are lower this year than \u2013 the guidance is for lower margins in Q2 than they were last year if I adjust for 606. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think a lot of things were happening in last year's number, right? I think if you look at Q1 and Q2 OpEx, by itself the total OpEx last year was down $4 million from Q1 to Q2. I've got the headwind coming in of FX that impacted the quarter as well. So I think looking at a quarter where it went up last year 5.5 points from Q1 to Q2, and trying to match that again this quarter is a little rough, right? So I think of it more of a sequential margin is probably more applicable as we try to get to a smoother glide path. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just longer term on where you see the most stability to accelerate the top line through investing, is it on the product side or is it on the sales and marketing side? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: The sales and marketing, we starting add capacity in the last couple quarter. If you look at the Q2 last year, the sales head count capacity actually was down compared to Q1, so that's actually limit our potential growth. So in the last two, three quarter, we started hiring \u2013 the head count hiring rate and we see it starting normalized now. But on the other side, we also starting improving the productivity and tried to improving both on the top line and the bottom line. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And, Keith, I'll add my congratulations on a well-deserved promotion. Actually I have a couple of very quick ones. For you, Keith, I'm wondering if you're still factoring in a slightly longer average duration in 2018 or if that's changed in one direction or another? And then just for Ken, I realized that it's still somewhat early, but what are you hearing from customers in regards to the Threat Intelligence Service that you've announced? Thanks. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hey, Gregg. It's Keith. Thanks for the comment. And I think we've talked before that we experienced \u2013 we modeled out a small uptick in term throughout the year. I'd probably pull back just a little bit from that, probably feeling \u2013 we've had good conversations about term internally, like the results that we've seen recently in our numbers. All the right people are focused on it. I wouldn't say it's a big shift, but I'm certainly not extending the term \u2013 let's put it that way \u2013 in the models. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think threat intelligence always is a big value-added to our customer because we have the biggest deployment globally, and help us collect a lot of available information. And also, we have one of the biggest team and the best team in the industry \u2013 and also working with some other partners in the CTA, Cyber Threat Alliance, which also cooperate and sharing some intelligence information. So we feel this is a pretty valuable, good intelligence information service, a lot of customer service providers can benefit, but it's still in the very early stage. We try to see what's the best way to share with some of the partner and the customer. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : Thanks very much for taking my question. Ken, I think it's fair to say there is a lot of conversation, if not even debate, amongst investors trying to appreciate the impacts of cloud and the opportunities and hearing triple-digit growth both in BYOL and on-demand in cloud, very, very compelling. And I was particularly intrigued to hear you speak about the seven-figure large retail deal that you took down in the quarter, and I was hoping perhaps you can just provide a little bit more color as an example. I'm assuming a transaction that large is an existing customer. And if you can just perhaps talk a little bit about the architecture, the use case in cloud? What it is that they're moving to cloud? And then, ultimately, what is their total spend with you today versus might have been in the past? I think that would be helpful to us. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hey, Brad. This is Keith. I'm just going to jump in front of Ken a little bit on this. So the first point is that's a new logo for us. That's not an existing customer. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : Wow. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. So we're very excited about that. And we did some economics on the back of the envelope of what it would have been if it had been an appliance sale. It's actually bigger as a software deal than it is as a hardware deal. So I'll hand that back to Ken. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Like I said, they also consider this as part of the whole infrastructure approach, but we have a very strong offering in the cloud environment also and especially very broad. Like I mentioned, we have the most broad cloud offering, not just network security, but also cover all different application from the sandbox, in the e-mail, the web, the management, and all the analysis. So that's because we're the strongest player in the cloud space, and also matched well in the Fabric approach. So we're the only vendor that can offer this infrastructure Fabric approach in the cloud environment. That's also driven the winning of some of the key customer. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : Thanks very much. And if I could, just a very quick housekeeping question for Keith. On duration, I heard the answer to Gregg's question about the full year. But can you remind us even just a year ago in Q1 \u2013 I don't think I have it in my model. Was that 23 months on billings duration a year ago? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I think sequentially duration is down one month. Year-over-year, it was up one month. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you so much. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, that's probably like making the product revenue a few percent lower if it's the same length. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse : Thanks, again. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Owens of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on something you said earlier with regard to the change in rev rec from sell-through to sell-in, and is that the balance of the delta in product? And is that persistent throughout this year? And not to get into the accounting side of it, but I'm curious what drives that change effectively. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, the rule certainly is consistent throughout the year, but we don't typically keep a lot of inventory in the channel. You can go back and check the Ks and the Qs. We have a mid-single digit number of weeks that we like to keep in the channel of inventory that's certainly not a large number. So what you saw in the first quarter was really just bringing the U.S. up to where the international distributors have been. To the extent that the U.S. has continued growth throughout 2018, there would likely be some uplift in that. But I don't see us making significant changes in how much inventory we keep in the channel at the moment. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And you're talking growth in partners or you're talking growth in kind of sell-through when you mention growth in the U.S.? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I mean, shipments and revenue growth, whether it's with the \u2013 I mean, the \u2013 I'm not quite sure I follow the question. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Well, if you're now recognize revenue on sell-in growth, then partners are going to afford you more opportunity to sell into a broader base. So I guess I'm trying to understand the velocity side of the equation more so? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: We sell to distributors who then sell onto resellers and we have a fairly short list of distributors in the U.S. to sell into. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the competitive landscape. Looks like your product revenue and subscription revenue growth clearly outpaced what Check Point reported this quarter. So I was wondering if you could give us any color on your competitive win rates versus Check Point. And then same thing versus maybe the other enterprise vendors, Palo Alto and Cisco? Thanks. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think our advantage over any other competitor is the first on the network security side. We're the only one building our own ASIC chip, and that's from day one when we started the company, even come from my previous company, is this philosophy actually helping driving the performance, additional functionality. You can see some other bigger company doing the GPU, TPU also for the similar past now and there's a huge benefit. We're keeping gaining share. No matter which competitor, we feel we're more comfortable to compete with anyone of them. And then we also offer a much broader approach and the most \u2013 nowadays the product are also built internally, whether from the endpoint, from the management, from the Wi-Fi access, from the web/email. So all this also helping drive, what we call, the infrastructure Fabric approach which from day one they build together, working together, integrate together, automate together. So none of our competitors can compete in on this broad and automated, integrated approach. So that's where we're keeping gaining from both on the network side and also, we call, the Fabric infrastructure side. I cannot comment on particular competitor, but I do see we starting grow faster, we keeping gaining share. And with additional sales and marketing capacity that we started building the last couple quarters, we feel more confident of keeping gaining share. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks, Ken. Keep up the good work. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. I wanted to ask on verticals. They look pretty consistent against F 2017 with the exception of EDU, which was pretty light year-on-year. And we heard the same sort of thing from CDW earlier this week. Keith, is that something we should expect to see continue through this year? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: No, I don't think there's anything to call out. I mean, the large deal we had in Q1 of 2017 was in EDU, so maybe that's skewing the numbers a little bit, but I wouldn't say as a vertical that has me concerned like that. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then, Ken, as a quick follow up. Any customer conversation perspective coming out of RSA that was different this year versus previous years? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: RSA is starting get a lot of noise now, I have to say. But there is no particular, but we do see the customers like the Fabric approach and which helping defend all this infrastructure from \u2013 I mean, multiple layer defense on the infrastructure side. And also they are very excited about the new high-end we launched, even still in the early ramp-up stage, but we do see a lot of potential will come from both the high-end and also the Fabric approach. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Congrats. Thanks, guys. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Michael Turits. Thanks. So, Keith, congratulations on the employment, and so a question for you. Thanks for the guide on CapEx for this year of $85 million to $100 million. Can you give us a sense for what that trajectory might be in the next couple of years as you get through the headquarters build? And also maybe you could help us in terms of the trajectory from last year going forward on cash taxes so we're just trying to get our cash flow right? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, the cash taxes in reverse order has not changed from the number that I simply had out before which is about $44 million. I don't know that we've talked about quarterly cash taxes. I could offer that if you took that $44 million... Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Just full year is fine. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then we don't guide on free cash flow. We don't guide long-term on free cash flow. But I could offer that the new building will probably be about 175,000 square feet going on our existing land that we already own. We would like to move in by the end of 2019. So that's probably enough data that you probably model how that might roll through. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much, Keith. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could discuss where your pipeline of both service provider and enterprise deals stand today relative to last quarter. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I don't know that we would go to that level of granularity, but I would say that we feel very good about the uptick in the pipeline. There's been a lot of people focused on it, it's doing a lot of good things and we're seeing results there. Carriers specifically, you've got two different models, you have EMEA and you have the U.S. We see indications in the U.S. that they may be moving a little bit more away from some of their maintenance mode of projects to some new projects, but I think that's very early on. There's a bit of a pattern in terms of how carrier comes in over the last several years. It has a lot of year-end activity, Q2 not so much. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also, with the additional investment we made in the marketing and the sales capacity, that's also helping driven the pipeline, the learnings, I think that's all helping to accelerate growth. Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Arete Research. Your line is now open. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you just help explain how the BYOL, bring-your-own-license, works? And then also how the economics work for you guys? If someone brings their own license, how that flows through? Thank you so much. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I think the simple response is they would buy the license from us and then they would take it to the cloud service provider. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Okay. So no change? It's just one-for-one? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Right. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : And that's measured on throughput? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Measured on throughput? No. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: That depends on how different application and where they deployed. Sometime like when you put something in the cloud, you also need to access that application and it may increase the need for secured access of that. So it's really \u2013 I'd say it's difficult to say \u2013 it's case-by-case, vertical-by-vertical for how this may impact or maybe increase the current business there. Patrick E. Colville - Arete Research Services LLP : Got it. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thanks, Peter, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter 2018 results. I'm pleased with our strong second quarter results. Billings increased 20% year-over-year to $530 million, while total revenue was up 21% to $441 million. Total revenue growth accelerate to 17% in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.1%. We post non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 and were profitable on a GAAP basis with earning per share of $0.28. We are experiencing strong global demand for our broad, integrated and automated Security Fabric offerings due to the digital transformation and a novel security refresh cycle that is occurring across most industries. The competitive advantage of our Security Fabric architecture coupled with our cloud offering and customer FortiASIC technology are contributing to market share gains. We expect to continue to deliver above market growth, balanced with profitability. Last week we announced a new breadth of offering within the Google Cloud Platform that provide multiple layer of security from our next generation firewall to Web application security and analytics. Additionally, Fabric Connectors are now available on the Google Cloud Platform enabling automation to apply consistent policy across multiple instance with One Click Integration. Fortinet now offers a broader set of security offering of any security vendor on the Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and AWS platforms. Fortinet FortiGate received its fifth recommended region in Europe from NSS Labs next-generation firewall testing, blocking 100% of the invasions and achieving an overall security effectiveness rating of 99.3%. In the past, FortiGate product also achieved the best performance for SSL inspection, thereby delivering the most compelling SSL Ready cloud secure access. Fortinet continue to gain significant traction in SD-WAN marketplace and Fortinet is the only security vendors that provides a unique combination of a next-generation firewall and SD-WAN in a single integrated offering. Customer around global has chosen Fortinet for their secure SD-WAN solution, including a seven-figure win during the quarter with Superunie, a European-based supermarket producer opposition (05:17) that represent over 1,500 grocery store with a combined market share of almost 30% of the Dutch market. This competitive win was against a large networking company. During the quarter, Fortinet increased its IoT security offerings with the acquisition of Bradford Networks. The integration of Bradford Networks technology with Fortinet Security Fabric provide large enterprise with the continuous visibility, micro-segmentation and access control technology that they need to contain threat and block untrust device from accessing the network. Our customer and partner response to the Bradford acquisition has been extremely positive and we look forward to leveraging Bradford's technology with our customer base, as well as introducing Fortinet product to the Bradford customers. Our recent development proved that Fortinet remain focused on solving our customer present security need and helping them drive their digital transformation. We are excited about the sizable opportunity that lie ahead to fuel above industry growth in this significant and growing total addressable market. We would continue to invest while remain focused on improving operation margin as we work towards our goal of achieving our long-term operation margin target of 25% by 2022. I want to thank the Fortinet team and our partner for their ongoing hard work and our customer for their support. Now, I will turn the call over to Keith for a closer look on our second quarter performance and our third quarter and full year guidance. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. Before I start, I'd like to note, except for revenue, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are based on comparisons to the prior-year periods unless stated otherwise. In the second quarter, our better than market revenue growth rate drove strong bottom line results and strong free cash flow. I'm very pleased with the second quarter results and believe we are well positioned to outpace the market for the rest of the year. Our infrastructure Fabric offerings continue to resonate well with existing and new customers. We have a strong industry leadership position due to our focus on delivering an innovative and high performing infrastructure Fabric product portfolio. Our product portfolio claims are supported by independent recommendations from NSS Labs and appearances in Gartner Magic Quadrants including the Leader Quadrant for both enterprise and UTM firewalls. We remain committed to balancing above market growth and improving profitability and as Ken mentioned, achieving our non-GAAP operating margin goal of 25% by 2022. Now for our second quarter results, starting with revenue. Revenue grew 21% to $441 million. Total revenue in the quarter included a $5.2 million benefit related to the ASC 606 accounting change. Excluding this benefit, total revenue growth would have been 20%. We expect the accounting change to have a similar impact on revenue for the remainder of 2018. Product revenue growth accelerated to 17%, resulting in product revenue of $166 million. Product revenue included a $4.2 million benefit from the change in accounting relating to certain software licenses. There was no benefit from the accounting change related to product shipments. Excluding the software license benefit, product revenue growth would have been a strong 14%. FortiGate unit shipments increased 18% and unit shipments of all products, FortiGate and non-FortiGate products combined increased 25%. Services revenue growth continued at 25% and totaled $275 million. FortiCare, our traditional support offering increased 29% to $116 million and FortiGuard, our security subscription offering increased 21% to $147 million. Regarding revenue predictability. As was the case in the first quarter, about 60% of total revenue came from our existing deferred revenue balances. In the third quarter we expect a similar percentage of our total revenue to come from our existing deferred revenue balances. Deferred revenue increased 27% to $1.5 billion in the quarter and average contract length increased two months to 26 months. Long term deferred revenue as a percentage of total deferred revenue increased three points year-over-year. As you can see on slides five and six, we remain a geographically diversified business. Second quarter revenue from the Americas represented 43% of our business. EMEA represented 37% and APAC represented 20%. Each region experienced strong revenue growth with EMEA, APAC and the Americas up 27%, 20% and 18% respectively. Turning now to Billings. Second quarter Billings grew 20% to $513 million. As a reminder, the accounting change has no impact on Billings. Each region experienced strong Billings growth with the Americas, EMEA and APAC up 22%, 20% and 17% respectively. Consistent with the strong Americas Billings performance, six of our top 10 and the majority of our top 25 customer Billings were with U.S. enterprise customers. One of the top Billings in the quarter was a mid-seven figure competitor displacement with a large U.S. metropolitan school district. In order to lower future operating expenses and increase network performance, the district chose Fortinet's products and services. These included 6000 series products and multiple Security Fabric products, including Advanced Threat Protection and sandboxing. Another significant Enterprise success was winning a deal with a large U.S. multinational financial services firm. This bank wanted a firewall vendor whose products integrated with other security products, a great use case for our Security Fabric platform. We won the deal over two incumbents and a third Enterprise firewall company. While the initial seven-figure billing was in the second quarter, we expect additional seven-figure billings to occur in future quarters as the customer transitions to Fortinet. Slide 7 shows our Billings mix by product family. As we have mentioned before, product level billings may not be the best way to represent the growth in our Enterprise and SMB or Channel segments. For example, a large enterprise will often deploy a significant number of mid-level and entry-level products into their distributed network. While this is an Enterprise customer, the billings would not be included in the high-end product family. As another data point, I would note, a subset of our Enterprise customers, specifically our Global \u2013 Forbes Global 2000 customers, excluding carrier, we saw Billings growth in the second quarter of 24% and trailing four-quarter average Billings growth of 30%. With this in mind, I should offer, we expect to transition away from providing Billings by product family if we are comfortable that we have data to share that we believe you will find more meaningful in evaluating our results and guidance such as Billings by customer class. Network security Billings accounted for slightly less than three quarters of total Billings and were up 15%. Non-FortiGate Billings accounted for slightly more than a quarter of total Billings and were up 33%. Within non-FortiGate, infrastructure Fabric and cloud continue to experience significant growth rates at 41% and 49% respectively. Cloud Billings of our top-five public cloud providers continue to experience triple-digit growth. Regarding billings by vertical, service providers and MSPs continue to be the largest vertical, accounting for 19% of Billings, up one point year-over-year. The number of deals over 250,000 grew 35%, driven by a 51% increase in deals over 500,000, illustrating the strength of our network security business among medium-sized companies. Meanwhile, the number of deals over $1 million were up 20%, demonstrating continued growth in our enterprise business. Moving through the income statement, I'd like to remind you that all numbers I mentioned will be non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. Our second quarter gross margin increased 60 basis points to 75.4%. Product gross margin was down 1.9 points to 56.5% due to product and geo mix as well as product transitions. Services gross margins expanded 1.4 points to 86.8%. Our total gross margin remains strong and growing due to the continued revenue mix shift to higher margin, more predictable services. Net of commission benefit, total operating expenses increased 16.1% to $240 million. Total head count in the second quarter was up 14%. Operating margin of 21.1% was up 300 basis points year-over-year and 340 basis points sequentially. Operating margin benefited from a number of items, including revenue growth and uptick in sales productivity and the benefit of the accounting change. Offsetting these items was a negative of impact foreign exchange of $3.4 million or 80 basis points. The accounting change benefited the second quarter operating margin by 370 basis points, the deferred commissions accounting for 270 basis points and the rest coming from the software revenue benefit referred to earlier. Please refer to the last slide in the earnings slide deck posted on our Investor Relations website for a line-by-line comparison of our non-GAAP results and our non-GAAP results excluding the adoption of ASC 606. We expect the third quarter and full year operating margin benefit from ASC 606 to be around 350 basis points. The fourth quarter ASC 606 benefit is expected to be about 300 basis points as the commission benefit related to ASC 606 is fairly linear in total dollar \u2013 on a total dollar basis, even in a quarter of seasonally higher revenue. Net income for the second quarter was $71 million or $0.41 per share based on 173.5 million shares outstanding. As expected, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Moving to cash flow and capital, cash flow from operations was $142 million, consistent with last year. Free cash flow was $131 million, up 124% year-over-year. Excluding real estate purchases in the prior year, free cash flow declined three points. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $12 million. We expect third quarter capital expenditures to be between $20 million and $25 million. Construction of the second building at our headquarter site is expected to start in the fourth quarter. We estimate 2018 spending for this project to be between $10 million and $20 million, occurring mostly in the fourth quarter. Total capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be between $75 million to $90 million. In June we paid approximately $17 million in cash to acquire Bradford Networks, augmenting our Internet of Things or IoT security offerings. In the second quarter, we repurchased 27,000 shares of Fortinet stock for approximately $1.5 million, bringing the year-to-date total to 2.5 million shares and $117 million. This compares to the first half of 2017 when we repurchased 848,000 shares for $33 million. On July 20, the Board approved a $500 million increase in the share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to $1.5 billion and extended the term to the end of 2019. We believe share repurchases are a good method of returning value to our stockholders and expect to repurchase shares opportunistically. As I turn to guidance, I'd like to remind everyone that the forward-looking disclaimer Peter presented at the start of the call applies to the guidance I'm about to provide. For the third quarter, including the benefit of ASC 606, we expect Billings in the range of $500 million to $515 million; revenue in the range of $445 million to $455 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margins of 21.5% to 22%; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.43, which assumes a share count of between 175 million and 177 million. For 2018 full year, including the benefit of ASC 606, we expect Billings in the range of $2.085 billion to $2.110 billion; revenue in the range of $1.770 billion to $1.790 billion; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 21.2% to 21.7%; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.63 to $1.67 which assumes a share count of between 174 million and 176 million. Slide 11 contains a summary of our guidance for the third quarter and the full year. Before I turn the call back over to Peter, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers and the Fortinet team, including our newest additions from the Bradford Networks for all their support and hard work. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter. Peter Salkowski - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Keith. We're ready, operator, to open the question-and-answer session. So if you could start that, that will be great. Thank you. Operator : Our first question comes from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on results and guidance. Ken, in your prepared remarks you mentioned an SD-WAN deal with a sizable European supermarket chain. SD-WAN, without a doubt, it is a topic that came frequently in our field work on Fortinet. When I'm correlating that to your accelerating product revenue for the remainder of 2018, can you talk to us about the SD-WAN opportunity that Fortinet is seeing out there? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. We started develop SD-WAN technology few years ago and even like four years, five years ago our core company related to this space. And that's further integrate into FortiOS, the FortiGate product and also keeping enhancing that. That's \u2013 we're making Fortinet the only vendor combining SD-WAN with security together. There is a huge advantage compared with the multiple box solution right now in the market with the other competitor \u2013 other vendor there. So that's where the customer feedback is very, very good is the huge advantage to manage cost saving and have the full security and (00:22:15) the flexibility in manageability there. So that's the example showing, it's a lot of customer see the huge advantage we have and more interest in this market we believe is a huge opportunity for us. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Understood. And maybe for me, maybe attacking the thing from the cloud perspective and the way that Fortinet looks at the cloud opportunity. So I know we've also mentioned NSS Labs. I believe that if you look at the SSL opportunity, I think companies such as the NSS Labs, maybe some others are predicting that probably about 70%, 80% of all traffic will be encrypted by 2019, 2020. How does that fits with what Fortinet is doing on the cloud front? Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, this is a great question because a lot of company starting moving the data to the cloud. So we make the broadest offer of all the function and also work deep in the cloud. But one key area for the cloud, really how to secure access the data. So that's where, like I said is 70%, 80% of traffic need to be encrypt. So that's where doing the testing on the nature of firewall testing, one key function need to be test is really the SSL encryption, which most call it access using that encryption to the access, especially on the mobile and some other device. So we have on average probably 10x the performance compared to any other vendor. It's all benefit from the FortiASIC, which we developed the technology from the day one when we start the company. So we do believe a lot of security function, they need to use in how more to accelerate, because security function is a heavy computing, without acceleration, it's a big impact on the performance, big impact on the CPU and other function. So that's where when we testing the next-gen firewall performance able SSL or disable SSL we don't see much performance change compared to other vendor, it's a big drop on the performance and that's make us (00:24:28) more than 10x much better than any other competitor. Plus, the box is more secure. We read about 100% emission test, 99% on other test there. It's really the best perform, the most cost efficient and secure access from a cloud solution for the customer. So that's really the benefit from the ASIC chip from the early development we invest into the technology. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you so much. Well done. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your line is now open. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. One for Ken and one for Keith if I may. Ken, just around some of the opportunities that you are seeing on the Wi-Fi side. That's an area that you haven't really talked about in a little bit, so I just wanted an update with respect to the product portfolio there, some of the competitive dynamics in the marketplace in terms of traction you are seeing there and then a follow-up for Keith. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes, I think what's interesting, we talk about the Fabric grow faster than the FortiGate \u2013 non-FortiGate grow faster than the FortiGate grow, like 33%. Actually among the non-FortiGate secured access that's including the multi compound Wi-Fi and also some we call FortiSwitch has the fastest growing area which grows triple-digit because we believe the recent few years ago the Wi-Fi management, just like SD-WAN, they need to be confirm with security and that's a huge advantage if we can integrate it together. So more and more customers expect \u2013 Enterprise customers see the need and that's making this integrate solution is a huge benefit for the customer. If you, like compare some other, like Wi-Fi opportunity, we still are relatively small. So that gave us huge opportunity going forward, because we are also as the only provider can combine Wi-Fi and security together into a single OS and single platform. So that's making the FortiGate can be also the Wi-Fi controller manage out manage all the AP together with security, result of Wi-Fi traffic. So that's where a huge benefit for Enterprise. Otherwise, we have to have two different management system and separate policy for security and Wi Fi, which is a big burden for that Enterprise IT guy. So that's also the benefit of the Fabric. With the Fabric, we can cross quite a broad attack surface to match together from the traditional security to the endpoint and to the management and to the Wi-Fi to the SD-WAN. So making the Fabric (00:27:18) approach is a more attractive to a lot of customers, especially enterprise customers. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : That makes a ton of sense. And Keith, I wanted to drill into the guidance and through the optimism that you're sort of baking into the guidance as we think about the full year. Can you help us understand some of the assumptions and sort of the dynamics you're seeing that's playing into the back half and how the year is going to play out with respect to your guidance? That's it from me. Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think we're seeing tailwinds that are coming with the product refresh cycle that we're going through on our side with the new E-Series. It's resonating extremely well, particularly in the mid-enterprise market. I think we would look to some recent CIO surveys by various analysts that speak to a tailwind that's coming from IT spending. I look at the pipeline, the quality of the pipeline I'm seeing a strong quality of the pipeline as we look forward. I'm seeing the deal size has increased in the pipeline. I look at things like tenure and productivity. I look at what was a very high level of execution by the sales and marketing group in the second quarter and the movement into the \u2013 continued movement into the Enterprise space. And I think all of those things are leading up to comfort. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter. Either for Ken or Keith, I wanted to spend a little more time on the product revenue growth number that 14% year-over-year normalized for ASC-606. Maybe you could just comment on a couple of things. One is, how much did that benefit from ASP on mix that that percentage of Billings coming from higher end products is up a little bit. And the other two comments, just on the refresh rate and win rates on new business, how did those three things play in together to get to the 14% number? Thanks. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, to answer the last question first. The refresh, I mentioned refresh cycle this time compared to the last time is about four years, five years now; last time that's 2012, 2013. But this time it's different than last time. There's no big news. It's not a rush-by pattern. It's a long evaluation and also making the refresh cycle probably last longer than last time. And that's actually played well for us because we have a quite broad product and also integrate well together, so that's really gave the customer chance to evaluate. Even the buying decision take longer time. But like we see the number, the bigger deal keep increase and also the last 12 months is better Enterprise growth in the last 12 months, like on average over 30%. So that's actually play well for us in this refresh cycle. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I'll just \u2013 Ken's spot on, Gabriela. I would just add a couple things that \u2013 maybe a little bit of the question is trying to get the guidance on product revenue going forward. And as you know, we don't guide to it, but I can offer a couple things that I think are coming to play. One is, we did change our comp plans for a small group of people here in the quarter to further incent them to focus on product revenue growth. And I think we certainly saw that come forward. I think the other data point I would offer is that when we look at the quality of billings in the first month of the quarter, Q2 versus Q3 \u2013 and again, keep in mind that the first month without linearity is a fairly small sample size, we're seeing Q3 is trying to shape up along the lines of Q2. But it's very early on. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And a follow-up if I may. On the mid-term model at the Analyst Day we talked about a 15% to 20% revenue growth number. You're right up at the upper end of that now when I look at the guidance and when I look at what you did in the quarter. How sustainable do you think that 20%-ish revenue growth number is? Is there a scenario where you could actually be up that for a little while? And Keith, if you could just clarify how much did Bradford Networks contribute to the revenue in the quarter? Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, good questions. I'll take them in reverse order. Bradford Networks, 34 employees; you can probably project from there, but I would also offer, it was in the six figures for Billings and revenue for the quarter. And in terms of growth, I think we're obviously very comfortable with the model that we presented at the Analyst Day in February. And I think we'll continue to perform against that model throughout this year. It would a logical time probably in the Analyst Day next February to see with the benefit of Q3 and Q4 what we'd like to start talking about from a mid-term or long-term model at that point. I think the other aspect of it is the Enterprise growth rate. Obviously we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing there and would like to see a few more quarters of that coming online as well. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is now open. Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Let me add my congratulations on the strong quarter. You mentioned that the Security Fabric integrating with other products was an important reason why customers chose Fortinet. Can you maybe give us some more color into maybe why that is and why it's an important differentiator, just given the breadth of partners that you have? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think like I \u2013 even we host an Analyst Day early this year, the Enterprise customer liking the Fabric a lot, that can help and lower the total operation cost, especially management cost because there is too many different security report in the Enterprise developed by different vendor which not quite integrate or automate together. So that's where we see the benefit of in-house develop of our broad portfolio over the product and integrate working together, especially for the Enterprise customer. Like I said in the Analyst Day, we still have a less than half of the customer or the partner be able to trend or to sell multiple product, which we will keep in \u2013 developing keeping trained \u2013 actually the other number I can give you, I think compared to one years ago the number of people trained up is certified on the NSE, the Network Security Expert almost double. So we'll continue to develop and that we hoping once the more partner or the customer or even our own internal sales force is trained on the multiple product approach, we'll keep increase the multi-product selling, the fabric selling. And also Fabric, because it's a multiple product also make it more sticky and add long term value bigger, make the deal bigger. And that's a win-win situation for both our side and also for the customer and for the partner. Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Got it. And then just to talk about some of the strengths in the quarter. I mean it looked like the EMEA region was particularly strong, even though all the regions seemed to do pretty well this quarter. Can you maybe give us some sense of what drove the strength in EMEA? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I think EMEA has historically done well for us. So I don't \u2013 I'm not shocked by it. I was very pleased with their execution. I do think they're getting some tailwind from GDPR. I think they are getting some opportunities with some competitive displacements. I think that we've given them a good product suite now in the low end and midrange that are resonating very well. Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Hey, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. Keith, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that the contract duration actually went up by two months. Is it \u2013 is this something where you are seeing customers coming in and planning to extend their contracts so that they can lock in Fortinet for a longer time? Or is it because your sales people are really trying to increase the duration for hitting their, like accelerators on commission given the change in the compensation plan? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's the fair way of asking the question. I think that we've made some changes in our price list and as well as our compensation plans that impact the terms of contracts. Is there some of that going on? Sure. But I don't think it's as significant as it once was. The \u2013 can you repeat the beginning of the question? I'm sorry, somebody just nudged me on something else. I think as you push into the Enterprise, I think it's very natural, particularly if you look, say, the example we gave, the large bank in the U.S, those are sticky implementations, the customer knows that. They are not going to be in a hurry to rip and replace. So I think as we \u2013 and I've said this before; as we continue to see growth in the Enterprise, we'll continue to see that product segment coming with longer contract terms. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Okay. And one on the presentation that you put out. On slide 11, if I see, that you are comparing the billings for 3Q and full year 2018 being compared to the billings of 2017; but they are on like ASC-606 for 2018 versus ASC-605 for 2017. I mean, I know I mean it couldn't \u2013 like, change in accounting standard would not impact it much, but since we are just doing it on a calculated basis, did the accounting rule have any particular effect on that growth rate that you have on the slide level? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: No, no. The accounting change has no impact on Billings. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon. My first question I just wanted to ask you on product gross margins. They were down a decent amount. I didn't hear anything in the prepared remarks, but perhaps I missed it. Why were product gross margins down? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, Keith. This is Keith Jensen. I don't think that we guide on product gross margins, but we do guide on total gross margins and I think you'll notice that total gross margins were up. So I think you can assume that we saw that \u2013 that that met our expectations, both the change in services and product. We did see a shift in our mix a little bit. As I alluded to earlier, our E-Series is doing extremely well in the low-end in the high-end. And when you have a product transition, there are some costs associated with that. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And did the M&A you took on this quarter impact that maybe a little bit too on the product gross margins? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: No. It was \u2013 as I said, it was low-seven figures for total revenue and split between hardware and software. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, the high end product we \u2013 like the 6000 series, 7000 series we launched early this year will take a longer sales cycle, both on the hardware and the software evaluation. The high-end tend to have a little bit higher margin. And also like Keith mentioned, when the turn, the service turn extend two months, that's also have some impact of the product margin. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Got it. Okay. And my follow up question then deals with cash flow. If we look at the start of the year versus today, some of the CapEx has obviously been pushed out. And so, A) It sounds like more of the real estate will actually show up in what would be calendar year 2019. Is there any, just notional amount you want us to think about for real estate in 2019? And then, B), just run rate CapEx, seems like the run rate now, just call it $50 million or roundabout away from real estate, is that a fair way to think about it or is there even variability in that $50 million characterization? And that's it for me. Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I don't \u2013 I think it's \u2013 you should not see in a run rate significant changes \u2013 large changes if you will from quarter-to-quarter. We're not a, say a data-centric \u2013 data center-centric company that's building out large data centers. We don't have lot of upfront tooling costs with our products. Over the longer term, you should see us pretty much aligned with head count drives that as you open up new offices, as you expand new offices \u2013 talking about leases now \u2013 of course there are some improvements to be made, that sort of thing, that they are kind of bumping around a little bit. But I don't think that the magnitude, that should give you concern. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Okay. And then just any characterization on real estate next year, just order of magnitude how should we \u2013 we should be thinking about it? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I'm just pausing because we don't guide the free cash flow; we don't guide the real estate. I think the probably thing that \u2013 we probably want to come back to that in the Q3 timeframe and give you something on that. But generally speaking, you shouldn't be shocked with the construction project. The timing slips as you get through with city approvals and environmental issues and so forth. So some of that benefit you're seeing in Q \u2013 in 2018, all things being equal will show up in 2019 assuming no delays in construction. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Understood, many thanks. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also, the real estate give us a much more benefit compared to some of our competitors, which we pretty much on a lease and both on a dollar and a percentage wise probably half or less than half of number of competitor that direct contribute back to the shareholder earnings on this instance and at the same time give us some flexibility, can have the facility built for long-term needs, especially for certain R&D, for certain infrastructure site. And that's \u2013 it's already \u2013 most the real estate investment we made already pay back and also is the long-term benefit for company going forward. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is now open. Jeremy E. Benatar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, hi. Jeremy Benatar in for Walter. I've got several questions on the large banks deal that you referred to in the prepared remarks. I guess, can you talk to roughly how large you anticipate the deal to be once fully deployed and is it fully booked? And then how does that factor into your full year guide? I have a follow-up. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, I guess the bad news is, I'm not going to disclose the total deal value. But I could offer that yes, it is in our guidance \u2013 as part of our guidance as an input. But what you typically see with the larger enterprises is a deployment schedule. And so you would not expect it to see all \u2013 all of it in any one quarter. We really don't have a concept of bookings as you refer to it. If we get a purchase order under a contract, we'll ship the product and you'll see it in Billings. Jeremy E. Benatar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, got it. And then I just had a question on traction in Enterprise. It sounds like business is improving. Can you talk about any changes you're seeing in the competitive landscape and then can you walk us through the driving factors in some of the larger enterprise wins? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, we have a reputation as a very good product, but probably be less investment in the market and also the coverage of the Enterprise sales also compared to a competitor also will be less. So we kind of starting more focus on Enterprise. We see it as expanding from some other channel advantage we have. So you can see the last 12 months, the Enterprise side growth as on average is 30%. Is probably like, as compared to some our competitors, it is market growth even come from maybe smaller base. But we do see the opportunity is big and also \u2013 there's also \u2013 we starting also invest maybe more on the marketing side, which also help in the Enterprise growth. So that's \u2013 and then the Fabric message and also help in \u2013 from the technical level there, I think that all this combined, we do see the enterprise as a big potential for us, probably the biggest growth factor for us going forward. So we are continuing to invest, both in the sales marketing side and also leverage the technology advantage we have, especially in the Fabric in the performance from FortiASIC. So we see is a very good potential in the Enterprise growth going forward. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes, and I would just add to that. I would reiterate two of Ken's comments. I think the total cost of ownership and the outstanding performance of the product give us clear advantage. I think the other two items, just to emphasize will be one, the Gartner Magic Quadrant, which we were in leadership for about a year now and we've actually timed that market pretty well with some normal renewals that are going with some competitors. So I think we're gaining \u2013 certainly gaining traction with that. And I think also the NSS Labs recommendations, the success that we're having there with our technical buyers are working very well. The last comment I would offer on that in terms of the opportunity that Ken is referring to. When we look at the penetration numbers in terms of that Global 2000 \u2013 I'm not going to disclose that number, but that's what drives us to say that we have seen clear success in that segment of the market and we see there's significant opportunity for more success in that segment. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes, also the product release timing also working well. So, with the high end and also some of the metering study releasing now, that also give us more advantage, even additional advantage over competitor, especially in the Enterprise space. Jeremy E. Benatar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Melissa Franchi of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hamza Fodderwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. This is Hamza Fodderwala in for Melissa Franchi. Looks like the Enterprise metrics looked really good, but it seems like the mix of the low-range and medium-range appliances is going up the most. And I'm just wondering, does this imply that there's a refresh happening more at the branch? And has there been any changes in the competitive landscape there? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I would \u2013 this is Keith. I would point you to the descriptions that we modified in the pie charts that speak to family \u2013 product family growth. And again, I would emphasize what we see with our Enterprise customers is they are buying too for the entire attack surface, which includes them purchasing low-end and mid-range products. And that's why it's \u2013 looking at product family I think is a somewhat flawed approach. And one of the discussion points we're having internally and I related to is that perhaps others are more interested in our Billings by customer class; and then a logical follow-on question would be, okay, now you know who the customers are, what are they buying? We seem to have kind of jumped into the second step. And that's a reflection of something we'd like to start talking about in the future. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also, from a sales force angle we try to see what's channel driven or partner driven and what's the \u2013 like our direct touch and also some of the bar. I think that's where we're starting tracking maybe different and that's we're making this Enterprise or channel-driven, it's \u2013 the split is a probably better fit into the space. Hamza Fodderwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And on the cloud Billings, they are particularly strong in recent quarters. Is that largely selling into the existing base of appliances or is it entirely additive? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think it's additive. And especially we say the top five public infrastructure cloud I think they grow probably triple digit. So that's where we see a good potential in the cloud. And also, we offer very broad portal function without the cloud provider and keep invest in this area. Hamza Fodderwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gray Powell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Gray Wilson Powell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones if that's okay. So, at an industry level, how do you feel about the pace of appliance revenue growth in 2018 versus 2017; do you see it picking up? And then, how do you see that trending over the next couple of years, particularly as virtual form factors become more meaningful? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think the virtual form, whether in the private cloud or in the hybrid or public cloud will add on top of the appliance. I don't think the impact \u2013 any impact of the appliances, because the whole infrastructure security which need to be both with the cloud and also with on-premise and with appliance together. And also some other, like Fabric approach whether the SD-WAN, the Wi-Fi all this in security, they do need appliance there to make it even working with cloud together. So that's where we \u2013 we don't see the virtual, other cloud has impact of the \u2013 it's very \u2013 in some degree even helping appliance sales, especially all this branch office sales, which we have also huge advantage. I think the refresh cycle definitely will help in \u2013 like I said, the refresh cycle starting like this year will help in the next couple years compared to last year or the year before. So that's we see is a good opportunity for us. Gray Wilson Powell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then just a follow-up. I mean, I know you guys touched on this in a prior question but I'm going to ask it anyway. So I mean the \u2013 if I back out the accounting issues, looks like product revenue growth jumped from about 1% in Q1 up to 14% in Q2. So just kind of a big increase; little unusual. How sustainable is double-digit product growth? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, and I think \u2013 this is Keith. And I think you've done the math exactly correctly; that's the good news. The \u2013 as I suggested a moment ago, we made some changes to comp plans, number one, with a select group of key decision makers inside the team which seemed to create some tailwind for it. I think we also are seeing very broad and robust acceptance for the new E-Series product that had started in the low-end, ended in the mid-range and I would believe that would create tailwind. And then again, when I looked at just the first month of this quarter versus the first month of last quarter and even though that's a small sample size given linearity, I think the indications are strong. I think the other aspect to look at is that \u2013 two other aspects. This is the third quarter now that we've talked about unit shipments and this time we talked about 18% unit shipments and that's in the range of prior quarters and then 25% when you count in the Fabric or non-FortiGate products. So you're seeing those Fabric product shipments also show up in the product revenue line as well providing more tailwind. Gray Wilson Powell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey guys, great quarter and thanks for the question. You guys talked about SD-WAN as having a good quarter and we've had some prior questions already. There's a competitor of yours making a lot of noise in the space around securing SD-WAN and partnering with pure play SD-WAN providers. I guess, first, is the go-to-market of this through managed service providers? And second, how often is SD-WAN essentially leading in deals compared to Fortinet security solutions? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Like I said, we are the only vendor combined SD-WAN with security together and been doing that for the last two years. And we do see a lot of opportunity. And SD-WAN will actually help in opening probably some other opportunity which when they try to work through the new infrastructure deployment, SD-WAN is the requirement that also give us an advantage of leading to some deal. And so that's where it's a big benefit for us. But also going forward, we do see the advantage and we have combined SD-WAN and security together. And also, the other thing is with our FortiASIC, keeping additional performance boost to thus making a solution not only flexible with SD-WAN network inside but also much better performance compared with some of our other competitors. And that you can see the branch offer is the growth is starting \u2013 showing quite a well number there. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And then, Keith, not to beat a dead horse here. But kind of based on my math here for revenue, it looks like guidance implies essentially product declining sequentially about 8%, which is well below normal seasonality. Is that you wanting to be kind of conservative on the model here or did you have any pull-forward of product revenue into the quarter? Thanks. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we don't guide to product revenue. But I think if you look at it sequentially, you might look at it a little bit differently that way and have a different perception on it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Owens of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great and thanks for taking my question. Leveraging Gray's strong math skills from earlier and I guess given the product revenue numbers, this is the best performance you've seen in quite a while. And, Ken, you spoke to a refresh cycle through the E-Series. And I guess, is this occurring within your own installed base or are you seeing this more network-wide where you're seeing better customer acquisition through E-Series right now? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think we do refresh our product every few years with whether the new ASIC, the new CPU or some other better networking technology. The E-Series, more starting from the low end and then the middle and then the high end early this year give us some of the benefit. But the refresh do not finish yet. It's only probably half or around half there. And we'll continue to get a new middle range or some other high end (00:54:50). And I think each new generation, E-Series compared with this year definitely have a big improvement on the performance and a better interface (00:55:05) there. But on the other side, the refresh cycle I mentioned also help. That's the industry-wide compared to the last \u2013 four, five years ago, the whole industry rushed by or whatever. Now is the time to refresh because the how or whether the networking or the server, whatever; after four or five years, they need to be upgraded. So that's opened up a lot of opportunity, especially in some enterprise. We probably not play that much in the enterprise last time. But now we see the opportunity starting to open up for us and at the same time, the fabric also played quite well with the enterprise customer. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the perspective. And then, second, if I compare your non-GAAP ASC 605 (00:55:50), I guess, operating margin result; it was actually down on a year-over-year basis about 70 basis points. And in the last couple of quarters, the benefit from ASC 606 and deferral of commissions has been far greater than, I think, anticipated or what you had articulated in the rough guidance. So two questions. Number one, why was it down on a year-over-year basis? And then, secondarily, as we look at your margin targets for the year, how much of that is a lift from ASC 606 at this point? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. So when you look at the operating margin year-over-year, I think you have to keep in mind that that was Q1-Q2 of last year. We were under-hiring significantly. And you probably saw that throughout Q1 and Q2. So those year-over-year comparisons are a little tough. I think, for example, one quarter last year, the operating margin went up 5 points quarter-to-quarter sequentially. So that's a little tough to execute each and every time. And I think I refer back to the comments in terms of the benefit from ASC 606. And I'll take it in two pieces. One, the software revenue benefit which is a reflection of software revenue growth for certain licenses, that growth has caught me by surprise. I'll admit to that. And that's about 1 point of benefit to margin. Last quarter, we talked a lot about U.S. hardware unit shipments and what was happening with the channel there. There was no benefit from that in the current quarter. And I think I mentioned at the time that we had a target in mind of how many weeks of inventory wanted to have. We pretty much hit that in Q1 and we kept it through Q2. So I would expect that to settle out at no change, if you will. On the commissions benefit side, I think the history of that is or where we're ending up is, with a couple of quarters under our belt now, we have pretty good visibility to it. Did we undersell a little bit in the beginning because of the complex accounting change? Sure, probably we are conservative. But this 250 basis points, 270 basis points in the current quarter; that appears to be a fairly good number at these revenue numbers. As that revenue increases, that benefit declines slightly which you'll see in the fourth quarter. So threw a lot at you. Happy to follow on if you want. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Really appreciate you guys taking my question. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question on cash flow, which I think was more focused on real estate and what to expect going forward. But even if we \u2013 and I know there's always lumpiness quarter to quarter on cash flow. But if we adjust for real estate and just look to the adjusted numbers that you give us, it's down year-on-year in the quarter. How should we think about cash flow for the year and what the puts and takes might be as it relates to this quarter and going forward? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I think when you look at the \u2013 good question, Brad. When you look at the year-over-year comparison \u2013 went back and looked. And what we really saw was the large inventory adjustment in our model came into play Q1 to Q2 last year. And I want to say that was in the $20 million range. And if you look at our inventory level since then, they've been fairly constant. So there was kind of a one-time benefit for inventory of about $20 million previously. I don't see myself dropping inventory, not with these hardware revenue growth rates by $20 million. So I think that's probably the large item. And that's about it with some cats and dogs. Cash for taxes year-over-year was up $3 million, payables and so forth. But there wasn't anything \u2013 other than that inventory change, this really wasn't something noteworthy. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And just if I could follow up. If I look at the mix of product and services, you're clearly benefiting nicely from the mix shift to higher-margin services. But while you incentivize product growth in the quarter, it seems services was more in line at least with Street models, not that we all know how to model your business. But even if I look at it seasonally, services is below the quarter-on-quarter growth that we saw Q1 to Q2 in the last couple of years. How much of this is a sign of just decelerating product in the last few quarters sort of catching up and maybe not providing as much attach opportunity? How much of it might be a sign of stronger contribution from refresh? Can you maybe just parse through a little bit the puts and takes and how it drives the services line? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: The services line is a very predictable number. It comes pretty much \u2013 as I said in the comments, 60% of it comes from deferred revenue. And deferred revenue was up 27% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. We do provide disclosures breaking down services revenue between FortiCare and FortiGuard. But again, both of those had very strong revenue growth. I think the other thing to keep in mind is services revenue, since it's coming off the balance sheet from deferred, that's a lagging indicator as opposed to a more current growth metric would be billings which is not something that we provide. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I appreciate it. Thank you, Keith. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski for any further remarks. Peter Salkowski - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Sonia.

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. I'm pleased with our strong third quarter result, as billing increased 22% to $528 million. Total revenue was up 21% or $454 million. Product revenue up a solid 20%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24%. We post non-GAAP earning per share of $0.49, and were again profitable on a GAAP basis with earning per share of $0.33. We aim to continue to deliver above market growth, balanced with profitability. We are experiencing strong global demand for our Security Fabric platform due to enterprise digital transformation, increasing consolidation and network security refresh cycle. Today, enterprise needs security that will go well beyond (03:20) product. This trend are expanding and opening up new opportunity for a broad, integrated and automated Security Fabric protection. The Security Fabric platform offers three major competitive advantages. First, our Fabric platform offers a broader set of end-to-end solution, providing protection from IoT to data center both on-premise and cloud. Organically built from ground up from two decades of innovation, the Security Fabric provides the best automation and integration in the industry. An example is our Security Fabric cloud offering on Azure. We now provide the most extensive offering of integrated security solution available on Azure including FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall, FortiSandbox, FortiCASB, FortiWeb, FortiMail, FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer's. A second differentiator is our superior price to performance capabilities. Fortinet is the only security company that build ASIC security processor, SPU, with integrated security and a network functionality, which provide a 10x the speed and performance of other software products. As a result, Fortinet's product provides significantly better security performance for both cloud and edge computing. The third competitive differentiator in our Security Fabric platform is the extensive third-party recognition and validation we have received from NSS Labs and Gartner. Fortinet has received recommended rating in nine out of nine NSS Lab categories, more than double the number of recommendations received by our nearest competitors. Fortinet was among the only three vendors out of 10 that received a recommendation for their SD-WAN solution and the only vendor to have received recommended rating in both SD-WAN and the Next-Generation Firewall group tests. Fortinet's Fabric platform solution have now appeared in seven Gartner Magic Quadrant over the past 12 months. Our SD-WAN solution was recognized as one of the top five solutions in Gartner's WAN Edge Magic Quadrant. Also, Fortinet was named in leader's quadrant for next-generation enterprise firewall and unified threat management. SD-WAN plays a pivotal role in realizing the true benefit of digital transformation and is forecast to reach $4.5 billion by 2022, up from $1 billion in 2018. Gartner state that by 2023, 50% of new firewall purchases in the distributed network will utilize SD-WAN features. Fortinet offers the only solution that provide both SD-WAN and next-gen firewall functionality in a single integrated offering for enterprise and SMB. We believe this technology advantage puts Fortinet in a solid position to capitalize on strong SD-WAN market growth. Last week, Fortinet announced the acquisition of ZoneFox, a cloud-based insider threat detection and response company. The acquisition further enhance the Security Fabric platform and strengthen our existing endpoint and FortiSIEM security through machine learning, providing a better and faster response to insider threats. Innovation is core to Fortinet's mission. In the third quarter, we surpassed a milestone of 500 issued patents, three times the patents issued for our nearest competitors. We are pleased to be added to the S&P 500 index, an acknowledgement of a double-digit year-over-year growth every quarter since going public in November 2009 and our consistent GAAP profitability. We are excited about significant opportunity ahead, and we will continue to invest, while achieving our goal of 25% operating margin at 2022. I want to thank the Fortinet team and our partner for their ongoing hard work and our customers for their support. Now, I would turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our third quarter performance and our fourth quarter guidance. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. Before I start, I'd like to note, except for revenue, all financial figures are non-GAAP, and growth rates are based on comparisons to the prior-year period unless stated otherwise. Any slide references that I make during my prepared remarks refer to the presentation that is posted on our Investor Relations website. I'm very pleased with our third quarter results, as the Fortinet Fabric continue to resonate with existing and new customers. In the third quarter, we posted revenue growth that outpaced the industry and operating margin was better than expected and strong free cash flow. We believe we are well positioned to outperform the security market in the fourth quarter. We are delivering an integrated and high performing Fabric product portfolio that is driving an industry leadership position. This claim is supported by the independent recommendations we received from NSS Labs and Gartner. Specifically, I would point to our nine-for-nine record of NSS Labs product recommendations, as well as Gartner, evaluating Fortinet as a leader in both the UTM and enterprise firewall Magic Quadrants. We remain committed to balancing above-market revenue growth with increasing profitability, as we work to achieve our non-GAAP operating margin goal of 25% for the full year 2022. Now for our third quarter results, starting with revenue. As shown on slide 3, revenue grew 21% to $454 million. Product revenue growth accelerated to 20%, resulting in revenue of $165 million. Product revenue included a net benefit of $2 million related to the required accounting change on revenue. Excluding this benefit, product revenue growth accelerated to 18%. Service revenue grew 22% to $289 million. FortiCare, our traditional support offering, grew 26% to $121 million; and FortiGuard, our security subscription offering grew 20% to $157 million. Deferred revenue increased 27% to $1.5 billion. Average contract length increased one month to 26 months and was flat sequentially. Turning now to billings. Billings grew 22% to $528 million. Each region experienced strong billings growth with the Americas, APAC and EMEA up 25%, 22% and 19% respectively. The U.S. provided strong enterprise growth in the quarter, accounting for seven of our top 10 and the majority of our top 25 customer billings. Billings to our Global 2000 customers, excluding service providers and MSSPs, on a trailing 12-month basis grew 31%. One of our top 25 billings in the quarter was a seven-figure transaction with the same large U.S. retailer we highlighted in the first quarter for their then seven-figure all-cloud transaction. The new transaction is focused on our ASIC-based FortiGates, including several of our high-end 6000 series of products. These high-end FortiGate products will be deployed to secure connectivity with their earlier cloud deployment. We also completed a quadruple competitor displacement with a large U.S.-based financial services firm, initially looking to improve their internal segmentation capabilities. After a very successful proof-of-concept, the firm decided to displace additional vendors, consolidating their functionality with Fortinet and lower their total costs of ownership. Also, in the quarter, a large U.S. multinational financial services firm that was highlighted in our last call appeared again as a top 10 customer with another seven-figure billing this quarter. Illustrating the strength of our mid-enterprise and enterprise business, the number of deals over $250,000 grew 27%, while the billings associated with these deals increased 34%. The number of deals over $1 million were fairly consistent year-over-year, moving from 32 to 30. The total dollar billings associated with these $1 million-plus deals increased 32%. Service providers and MSSPs continued as our largest vertical, accounting for 19% of billings, up 2 points year-over-year. Network security billings increased 22%, accounting for slightly more than three quarters of total billings. Billings for non-FortiGate grew faster than the FortiGate business. The Security Fabric, which is the largest component of our non-FortiGate offerings, benefited from customers' recognition of its value, performance and integrated security coverage. Cloud billings for our top five public cloud providers continued to experience growth in excess of 100%. Moving back to the income statement. Our third quarter gross margin increased 50 basis points to 76.5%. Product gross margin was down 120 basis points to 57.4%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, product gross margins were up 90 basis points, as we continue to transition through a certain level of volatility related to new product introductions. Service margins expanded 120 basis points to 87.3% and 50 basis points sequentially. Including the commission benefit associated with the required change in accounting, total operating expenses grew 11%. Excluding the benefit from the required commission accounting change, total operating expenses would have been up 15%. Including a 240 basis point benefit from the commission and revenue accounting changes, our operating margin of 23.9% was up 520 basis points year-over-year. Excluding any benefit from these accounting changes, our third quarter operating margin increased by 280 basis points year-over-year. The operating margin improvement was mostly driven by leverage in our financial model, as revenue growth outpaced total operating expenses. Slide 14 shows a line by line comparison between our non-GAAP results and the non-GAAP results excluding the adoption of the new accounting rules. In the fourth quarter, we expect total operating margin benefit from the required accounting changes to be about 250 basis points. For the full year, the operating margin benefit is expected to be about 300 basis points. Total head count at the end of the third quarter was 5,639, up 15%. Net income for the third quarter was $87 million or $0.49 per share, based on 175.7 million diluted shares and was up 75% year-over-year. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Moving to cash flow and capital, summarized on slide 7, cash from operations was $177 million, up 9% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $159 million, up 13% year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow increased 32% to $417 million. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $18 million. Given the strong growth we've experienced, we will outgrow our existing office space in Sunnyvale. As a result, we have started construction on a building adjacent to our existing office. In the fourth quarter, we expect capital expenditures in the range of $5 million to $10 million related to this building. We expect total fourth quarter capital expenditures to be between $20 million and $30 million. Total capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be between $60 million and $70 million. Capital expenditures related to the adjacent building are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million in 2019. We plan to provide quarterly spending updates throughout 2019 and plan to move into the building in 2020. As I turn to guidance, provided on slide 9, I'd like to remind everyone that the forward-looking disclaimer Peter presented at the start of the call applies to the guidance I'm about to provide. For the fourth quarter including the benefit of ASC 606 and an immaterial impact from tariffs on cost of goods sold, we expect billings in the range of $620 million to $635 million, revenue in the range of $490 million to $500 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24.0% to 24.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52, which assumes a share count of between 178 million and 179 million. For 2018, including the benefit of ASC 606 and an immaterial impact from tariffs on cost of goods sold, we expect billings in the range of $2.125 billion to $2.140 billion, revenue in the range of $1.785 billion to $1.795 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 21.5% to 22%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.72 to $1.76, which assumes a share count of between 174 million and 176 million. Before I turn the call back over to Peter, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work. I'd also like to welcome the employees of ZoneFox to the Fortinet family. I'll now hand the call back to Peter. Peter Salkowski - Fortinet, Inc.: Ok, Keith. Operator, we're ready to open up the call for Q&A, please. Operator : And our first question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now open. Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to start out with maybe the Security Fabric. It sounds like this was another strong quarter in terms of demand. Can you maybe give us a little bit more detail in terms of what elements of the Fabric maybe stood out? And also, do you have a separate quota for the sales force to retire, related to the Security Fabric? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, Jonathan, it's Keith. Second question, first. No, we do not have a separate quota for the Fabric, for the sales team. If you look to the product family, I would highlight the access points and the switches performed very well in the quarter. That continues a pattern that we started see shaping up in the beginning of the quarter as well. I think also I would add to that list FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiSIEM. Overall, the product suite of the Fabric performed very well during the quarter. Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Excellent. And then, just looking at the operating margin trends. You guys have guided to a pretty strong operating margin in the fourth quarter after delivering a strong third quarter. How should we be thinking about that on a go-forward basis? I know you guys made some investments earlier in the year as well that start to show leverage, but I just want to make sure that we're thinking about that the right way. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And we're not in a position as we go through the budgeting cycle that we're in right now for the coming year to really talk about guidance for 2019. Obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of the company in Q3 on the top line and on the operating margin line. I think the productivity from the sales organization, you've seen that come into play in third quarter. We're very pleased with that. I'll probably leave it to Ken to talk a little bit about market forces and what we're seeing beyond just the Fabric growth but other comments as well. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, actually, we saw strong building growth, like a 22%. Our head count hiring probably little behind that. So, the healthy way for long-term growth need to be synched together for the top line growth and the head count growth. So, that's where we may catch up little bit. On the other side, we do see the refresh cycle still going on. Maybe it last another one to two years. The other opportunity that we see is SD-WAN is a huge opportunity, like I mentioned in the script. In the next few years, will be reached from this year $1 billion to $5 billion. And we are the only vendor who can provide both SD-WAN and also security, yes, single path, single solution, that's a huge advantage for lot of enterprise SMB service provider. We see a very strong demand. We believe this trend will be carried for another few years of growth, very strong growth. So, that's why we want to keep in balance among the growth and the profitability. So, we (21:42) both the top line and bottom line. We also have the commitment, 25% operating margin by 2022, but we also want to keep in \u2013 invest in the growth going forward. Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. I get a number of questions from investors trying to understand, especially in the high-end enterprise, how much of the demand and success you're seeing is still data center focused versus now, with all the talk of Fabric and micro segmentation. So, just maybe just some additional color around what's driving the success in particular in the high-end enterprise part of your business. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: We do see both growing well, whether in the data center cloud and also in the internal segmentation and edge computing. Because once (22:43) when they move the data to the cloud, they also need to secure the access to it, and actually add some additional risk because now in the cloud, if you cannot secure access, then the data probably more risk, more danger there. So, that's how to secure access the data, actually leveraged like SSL encryption since it's very, very important. The most other current network security solution there have a big performance issue with SSL encryption, but we have the ASIC solution, which when you do the SSL encryption for the traffic, you almost no \u2013 no traffic drop compared with other solution test \u2013 is about 80% drop off the throughput. So, that's what we see. As for the enterprise, there's a hybrid and will move some data to the cloud compared \u2013 some more internally. So, they need to balance amount of what's the data go to the cloud, what's data \u2013 and what's computing still within the edge, within enterprise. So, we see enterprise definitely keeping increase the security spending, even some IT spending probably pretty much flat. So, it's still very healthy, and we continue to believe the security will grow like 10% or even above in the next 10-plus years, and the total market, that's going to reach like $1 trillion in the next 10 to 20 years. It's a very healthy, long-term growth market. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the beat-and-raise. Ken, probably one for you; one for Keith. Going back to the refresh product cycle, you've been around your entire career within the security arena. As you think about the current cycle, would you characterize it as if we're in the initial innings, midway? How would you think about it versus prior cycles; timing and maybe even demand and product wise? Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: A few of this cycle compared to the rush by happening end of 2012-2013, this probably last a little bit longer, maybe a few quarter longer, maybe last more like two year, two-and-a-half, three years. We are probably close to the middle of it. But the difference is this time they consider multiple solution together, (25:29) platform. So, they also need to find a way to integrate to automate a solution, compared to the last cycle that's refreshed from the regular firewall to the next-gen firewall UTM. And that's where this time, they need to consider how this different piece can work-in together, whether from the network side, endpoint, the cloud, the networking side, even some storage and IoT. So, that's where they kind of have a more bigger picture, kind of infrastructure, kind of approach compared to that's the network side. But also we see some kind of a new infrastructure, whether the SD-WAN or the 5G, similar like in the past, we see also very strong platform fabric growth really, the Wi-Fi also need to be considered together with security. So, that we see as a kind of the total infrastructure Fabric platform approach is happening right now, and consider the security more integrate or designed with the infrastructure, instead of just a \u2013 like a add on top of some infrastructure. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Understood. Thank you so much for this color. And maybe one for Keith. Really strong showing on the DSO front; probably lowest in some quarters. Doesn't matter whether it's ASC 605 or even ASC 606. Can you talk to us about that? And maybe also about linearity trends you have been experiencing through the quarter? Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. And thanks for your nice comments. Yeah, I think DSO came in. I don't think there was anything really unnatural in the numbers. And that just kind of leads up to your \u2013 second part of your point. I think linearity in the quarter was indeed good, and it kind of held its pace, I commented on about the first month of the quarter in the last earnings call, being good. And I think it kind of continued on through the quarter. And I think you're seeing that in the DSO number. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Understood. Thank you so much. Good luck. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski... Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Anybody there? (27:47) Operator : Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski? Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yes. Can you hear me? Operator : Yes, we can hear you now. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Thank you. Well, congrats on a nice quarter. I just want to ask about the large customer win that you had, the quadruple replacements. Since that was clearly more than a firewall replacement, can you give us any color as to what products that customer consolidated onto the Fortinet platform? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, when you start to see multiple products like that, it's going to go beyond the firewall right into the Fabric, right? And more often than not, you'll see, as I indicated previously, from a hardware viewpoint the access points and the switches are doing very well. And then you roll into that typically a suite of FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiSIEM, FortiCloud, et cetera. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Got it. And then, just maybe a comment on the large deals. They looked like they were down. I'm talking about the million-dollar deals were down sequentially. Did any deals push out into Q4 that might have caused that number to be down year-over-year? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I think when you look at that population, again, I think it was off by two I think year-over-year, from 32 to 30. You're going to get a little bit of volatility in that segment of the market, so I'm not surprised by it. I was very pleased to see the total dollar value that was billed in those large deals. Even though the number was smaller, the total billings were up about 34%, I believe I said. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Got it. Thanks. Congrats. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good evening. Thank you. I wanted to ask two questions, if I could. First, the services revenue has been humming along at 25%, 26% year-over-year growth for five quarters. This quarter it deceled a little bit, again larger number, but deceled to 22%, while the product revenue, its second straight quarter of really good growth. And so, I'm just wondering, was there anything on the services side? Any reason why it deceled outside of larger numbers? And what does that portend that the product revenue growth has been so strong for a couple of quarters now? Does it suggest an point in terms of acceleration back to the services side? Then I have a follow-up, if I could. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Okay. Hi, Keith, it's Keith. How are you? Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Look. I think, obviously, we're very pleased with the results for the quarter both from the top line and the bottom line, and as you know, we manage or we guide to total revenue into the margins. So, within that mix of services and products, we're very pleased with where we ended up including the gross margin line. I think a little more specific to your question, one thing we looked at was, our renewal rates were very good in the quarter, up over what we normally see. Attach rates were very good. The mix of 24x7 versus 8x5 support was very good. It ticked up again. As I said, renewal rates, attach rates. So, I think it's a larger base is part of it, as you point out. I think the other key element of this is something that we've talked about a little bit in the Analyst Day and as the Fabric platform came online, we expected it to bring with it a higher mix of hardware. And that higher mix of hardware what you're seeing in the top line on the product revenue growth, and then a smaller mix on services. And I would really point to access points and switches for that. So, I think you're really starting to see the impact of the platform strategy from the Fabric, and how it's appearing in the success it's driving on the income statement. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Also, we introduced a new service called the FortiCare 360, that's beyond the traditional FortiCare 8x5 support and then 24x7 support. This will be helping the Fabric service going forward, is helping to manage, to configure, to deploy and also to help check off some of the Fabric solution there. It's still in the early ramp-up stage, but we do believe including the future Fabric and also the new trend in the SD-WAN. So, this service is needed, and we see also very quickly ramp up, even though it's in the very early stage, we do believe this will help in the future service growth. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then my clarification, Keith, is just \u2013 you guys have provided operating margins for the year. And let's just say for giggles it ends up being 22% operating margin pursuant to ASC 606. When you talk about growing to that target of 25%, I assume the base that we should think about in 2019 is 22%. In other words, the base isn't ex the benefit of the accounting translation as we think about 2019? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think the way we've always described it is \u2013 that \u2013 that's a ASC 605 number, and we're tracking to ASC 605. And part of that \u2013 the reason we're looking at the ASC 605 number in terms of that commitment is, as you can see, it's moving around on us, right? It's come down from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, and it can be impacted by things like product revenue mix, comp plans, service term, et cetera. So, I think just to keep this all very honest on our side of the table, it's a ASC 605 goal. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So, if we think about 2019, again just using 22% as the reference point, should we expect operating margins to be flat, down, or up relative to 22%? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: For 2019? Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah. I'm going to pause on providing guidance for 2019, other than offering up our long-term model that we've talked about before and what we're targeting over time. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Let me go through my budgeting process and cycle before I do that. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on some of the momentum you're seeing in the Global 2000. I guess this is kind of for Keith. Could you comment on to what extent the volume of opportunities, the number of engagements that you're invited to bid upon, how is that changing relative to history? And if you could also comment on win rates for Global 2000 business. Once you're invited, how often do you win? And is that number changing at all? Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Hi, Gabriela. It's Keith. How are you? I would say the pipeline in total, we're very pleased with the direction of the pipeline. And in the segmentation of the pipeline, I think the fact that I'm pleased applies to both our very important SMB part of our business and also the Global 2000 part of the business. Yeah, I think the \u2013 we're well positioned with an opportunity to continue to lead in the SMB and expand into the enterprise. And I think that trailing 12-month number of 31% growth is a very positive indicator. In terms of wins and losses, that's \u2013 we're not \u2013 other than the carrier MSSP, we're not the incumbent. It's always a little more challenging to displace the incumbent. But I think when we have those opportunities we're doing well, and we're very pleased with it. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yes. Also, we're starting to invest in the market chain to support the sales into the Global 2000, and we see pretty good progress there. And at the same time, it's \u2013 even within the sales, we starting kind of a separate some of the effort of organization by focusing the channel or focusing the Global 2000. So, that's where \u2013 once we have the focus we can see the growth pretty healthy. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. And follow-up on the gross margin. Can appreciate that gross margins are expanding in aggregate year-over-year, but I want to talk specifically on product gross margin. Could you help us understand, for Keith, when that number might start to trend upwards? Or when you might start to see stabilization within that product gross margin line? Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's a fair question. I'd probably just going to offer you some context. It can be impacted by the mix obviously between products and services in any quarter. Specifically, when you look to Q3, the Q4, the sequentiality, our mix typically ticks up a little bit to product, which puts a bit of pressure on the gross margin line. I do expect that we're going to continue to see growth and improvement in total gross margin and largely driven by the services component of that. And I think we're kind of fast forward to the punch line. We're on track to that 25% goal, and that gross margin line is a component of that. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, also like early this year during the Analyst Day, I believe you were there (37:01) we do see that the long-term growth margin target is 80%, and at same time we refreshed some of the middle range product. During the refresh plan, the gross margin drop little bit and then will come back up once the ramp-up refresh starting to finish. So, we do see the long-term trends still the same, and we're still keeping the 80% target for gross margin long term. Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I appreciate the color. Thank you. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is now open. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Keith, maybe to start with you. Just on the service provider business, just according to my math, that was a nice acceleration off of the second quarter. So, can you give us a sense of what sort of budgeting behavior is actually playing out in the service provider vertical that underpin the strength? And as we look into next year, what sort of activity are you anticipating? And another follow up if I may. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think the, and Ken may want to weigh in here a little bit, but I think the MSSPs portion of that service provider is really what you're seeing, and that's historically been the larger part of our business, and we're seeing that do exceedingly well. I think the SD-WAN discussion now is really coming into play as part of that business as well. And I think you're seeing that starting to drive -we've had some conversations with customers that SD-WAN opportunity is really starting to drive some pipeline growth. I think 5G will be a part of it as well. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Right. Yes. That's where we do see the SD-WAN technologies starting kind of being used by some new relatively small service provider trying to get a market share from the traditional MPLS offer by some of the bigger carrier, service provider. So, at the same time, the 5G, some other technology is starting taking off now. So, our philosophy is working with service \u2013 all kind of service provider, both large and small, and offer the best product and tool and this security into the service they're offering. So, we see this strategy working quite well, that's where we had only one offered SD-WAN together with security, Wi-Fi together with security and also going forward some other new things in security together. So, that's the strategy the service provider like a lot and that's when compared with some other like a network vendor or the security vendor, they have to catch up to buying company to follow the trend comparably kind of a long-term invest in all this year, few years ago and keeping investing for the long-term and offer integrate automated solutions, which is much better for the service provider for the customer. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : That's helpful. And, Keith, just a quick one. Last couple of quarters, you gave us some color on shipment volume. Just wanted to see if there was an update there and to the extent it's sort of held into that the 20%-ish ZIP code. How should we think about that from a sustainable basis, looking out the next couple of years as we think about hybrid architectures and cloud migration? And that's it for me. Thank you. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, sorry about that. I know we're just consolidating on words in my script. FortiGate unit shipment is up 16% year-over-year. All shipments up 20% year-over-year, I mean, quote 21%, but I'll go with 20%. Fatima Boolani - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Ives from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Strecker Backe - Wedbush Securities : Hi. This is Strecker Backe for Dan Ives and our question is based on your conversations with customers, are you seeing an inflection point with larger scale security deployments in the field? Thanks. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I see more multiple solutions integrated together to deploy. Yeah, we do see some sometimes the deals get larger on the \u2013 because when you have multiple solutions integrate, automate together, that you can \u2013 I'm not sure that's a trend or not. It's still too early to say like a bigger deal or the bigger customer make it over a $1 million dollar deal. The size got bigger, the number not quite, real flat, but I do see the deployment study need to be more integrate, more kind of multiple solution working together now. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, and I would just \u2013 Ken is spot on and I would just kind of remind people that oftentimes we see staged deployments with our large enterprises and so you will see some of these deals appearing from a single customer, they'll be buying in Q2, Q3 and then again in Q1 or something like that. So I think it's difficult to look at an individual customer because it's more than one quarter and offer a comment on that. But yes, the enterprise does drive larger deal sizes, whether that's just because of the number of firewalls or it's because of the fabric products that are being attached to it. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah and I think also we believe we have a huge advantage because most of fabric partner don't do internally organic designs they want the designs to work together, integrate together. And also including some networking function like SD-WAN compared with some other company, they have to purchase some of these product solution, which always very difficult for the integration and always take time to make it working together. So we have huge advantage. So we do see the benefits are bigger and bigger now. Strecker Backe - Wedbush Securities : Great. Thanks for the color, guys. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Owens from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You guys are clearly in share gain mode, especially given the product success that you're seeing. What's the competitive response been? What's the pricing environment like? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: We don't have any price pressure right now. So that's why we keep \u2013 feel the gross margin can keep improving because one of the key differentiator is we are the only one design ASIC chip. Now, we (43:50) deploy and also the (43:50) been working, whether the two-sided effect, the more we deploy, they can also lower the average cost for the chip and also design cost average per chip. At the same time, customer see more benefit we can invest more in there, but that ASIC chip take a long time, 5 to 10 year to see the benefit. So far, none of our competitor have been able to invest early enough to get in the space to see the benefit we have. So once we have a bigger and bigger number unit deployment and market share, we also see the accelerated benefit will help us to keep a differentiated advantage more. Yeah, that's pretty much... Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. I guess second, with regard to it being the September quarter \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this in prepared comments, but any discussion around the Fed? It seemed like you had decent success in that vertical as well. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think all of our U.S. government vertical, which is a vertical that we've previously disclosed, had a good quarter. We were pleased with it. And I do think that there was a little bit of \u2013 I think U.S. Fed part of that business, which again is a subset of our total vertical, did well in the quarter. Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Melissa Franchi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Melissa Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. A question for Ken or Keith. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what you're seeing in terms of sales cycle. So on one hand, it seems like it's a very healthy security demand environment, you're seeing good refreshes. But on the other hand, you're now selling a broader suite with the Security Fabric, and that might require a broader rethink of the security architecture. So just wondering if that's creating maybe a little bit of elongation in the sales cycle. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I agree. It's a very good point. We do see customer take a little bit longer time when they consider multiple solution, multiple product need to be working together, but also that can make the deal also larger. And also, we have to train both ourselves as well as the partner how to sell multiple product and make it all working together as a fabric solution. It's a very good point trend for this kind of refresh cycle. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think we feel very good about the sales cycles. I mean, again, because we have success in both the SMB, the channel, the carrier, as well as the enterprise \u2013 looking at the number for the quarter, I don't think that the elongated sales cycle was the issue. I certainly do see us building things in our pipeline that I guess I would call longer term and perhaps larger dollars, but those are much further out. Melissa Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just one quick follow-up for you, Keith. You mentioned the contract duration this quarter was up just a little bit year-over-year \u2013 I think one month. How should we think about how that trends for Q4 and then any visibility into 2019 from a contract duration perspective? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think not something I would normally guide to, let's say, and I think previously I've talked throughout the year that we would expect that the contract term would tick up during the year. And I think that's probably going to continue on to the fourth quarter. Melissa Franchi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen. Your line is now open. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. First question is for you, Keith. This quarter, FortiGate billings grew very well and they continue to hover around 75% of total. And I know that you're not yet providing guidance for next year, but just from a high level, how should we be thinking about the mix for FortiGate versus non-FortiGate over the next 12 months or so? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Well, I think if I look back over the last \u2013 over this year at least, this pretty much kind of hovered in that similar mix, if you will. We are very pleased with the FortiGate Fabric platform and we will certainly continue with that as a key point of our strategy throughout 2019. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: The non-FortiGate grow a little bit faster than the FortiGate. But interesting with \u2013 now we offer SD-WAN within the FortiGate, we suddenly got into some \u2013 the infrastructure solution deployment, which have a security design-in. So that actually will help in the FortiGate side. So we are not quite sure what's going on. But definitely we see the non-FortiGate so far early this year, they grow faster than the FortiGate. But SD-WAN may changing this a little bit. But overall, we do see this will also bring additional service and also make the total solution better, stronger and because there's a multiple solution or with the customer, it's also making it more stickier with the customer. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then Ken, how should we be thinking about the timing of the next ASIC product cycle for Fortinet? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I'd say it's pretty close. I think within the next few months or few quarters. It's very close now. About every quarter, we do refresh some other product like some of the middle range, some of the \u2013 and also, we do have a \u2013 last year, we had, what we called, a CP9 camera last year which is improving the SSL encryption quite a lot. It's more like a 15x improvement, so that's a huge advantage when you try to deploy the cloud access, so working beautifully both on the cloud and on the edge. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from Michael Turits from Raymond Janes. Your line is now open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Michael Turits from Raymond James. Thanks very much. Ken, for you. Back to the cycle question, there is some concern about a fall-off in IT spending overall into 2019. Are you starting to see anything that would suggest any hesitancy in terms of buying as people exercise some caution regarding the macro economy? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, they do have a little bit concern in the last couple months, but is \u2013 but we don't see the security. Security within IT spending is still keeping increase. So even the IT spending flat, we do see the security will keeping growing like a 10%, 15%. That's why also, I believe the next 10-plus years will reach $2 trillion market as \u2013 because security got more and more important for all the business we're doing here all connect together. And also, plus the additional, like IoT/OT security and plus the clouds and market POP. You do see the overall security spending is not decreasing, but keeping similar pace in the last like 20-some years. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then Keith, can you talk a little bit about the specific things that you've been doing in the channel and in the field in general in order to help move Fortinet up the market? I know that you had talked about increases in incentives to sales a little while ago. Can you be specific about where you are with that as well as what you're doing in the indirect channel? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, boy this is \u2013 a lot of credit goes to the sales team, I think, for their execution, together with the support from the marketing team and the R&D team. So \u2013 but I'm not sure that's \u2013 if you're asking about comp plan specific, I think we talked previously that we did create a separate commission element for products in the second quarter. I think more importantly and specifically with comp plans, one thing we did in the U.S. at the beginning of this quarter is we actually took the next step and separated the SMB business from the enterprise business in terms of how those compensation plans work and who's responsible for it. And I would say I was ecstatic with the results on both ends of the spectrum. The SMB channel in the U.S. did extremely well and the enterprise in the U.S. did extremely well too. I think there's just \u2013 those teams performed exceedingly well. We got a little lift in productivity probably from that. And as we've talked before that I expect \u2013 I don't see us separating the company, but I do see us continuing with our focus and how we go to market in these different segments and continuing to invest in both. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Excellent. Thanks so much for taking my question. And I'll just say that I continue to hear great things in the field about the Security Fabric message and the product offering; as well your SD-WAN product sounds like it's really gaining great traction. But my \u2013 and it's easy to see why you're gaining share on the market as a result of that. But my question is actually around Security Fabric on Azure which, Ken, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, and I know it's only about a month or so ago that you announced the expansion of that offering to include more of the fabric components. I'm curious and again, I know it's early, but can you maybe comment a bit about how you see customers embracing your offering versus the native capabilities within the Azure platform itself, such as Azure Firewall Service, for example? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: I think we have the approach more like a hybrid solution and that's where like a customer has the freedom whether deployed our products their premise or some of data application go to the cloud. For the Azure, the same thing. We have also the broadest security cloud offering, whether on Azure, on the ASS or on some other like Google, Oracle, IBM, some other cloud. So that's where we want to offer the broadest, the best solution which customer can select how to best fit their need and also offering the flexibility to transfer between \u2013 changing between whether on-premise and also on the cloud. So that's different compared to some of the native cloud provider offers some of the security service, which they more focus in certain application only and it's not based on the networking side or the infrastructure side. So that's where we are not competing with them, it's more a like a different layer of security, so we're more on the infrastructure layer, on the network side and compared they're more focused on certain application. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I appreciate that color, Ken. And for Keith, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the impact of tariffs on certain aspects of the results. And I think intra-quarter, you might have commented on this publicly, but can you just spell out for us exactly what the situation and exposure is to China trade tariffs? Thanks. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, the headline would be, in Q4, it would be less than $300,000 of impact, probably significantly less, and in Q1 for the January 1 date, it will be less than $500,000 on a quarterly basis to COGS. Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Excellent. Thanks so much, guys. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kenneth Talanian - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could rank your success in the enterprise by geo and then separately by vertical. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I think I commented \u2013 that's getting a little specific. I'd probably go back to the comments I made a moment ago that I thought the U.S. did exceedingly well in the enterprise segment of the business in the third quarter and I'm really, really pleased with what they did. But I think going to the next level of detail is probably where I would pause. Kenneth Talanian - Evercore ISI : Okay. And I guess you mentioned folks are making multiple purchases over time. Are you booking, but not invoicing deals? And does that essentially give you some more visibility into future results? Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: I'd still put that more as a pipeline discussion, if you will. It just moves closer and closer to the close rate, but I'm not sitting on a large backlog, if that's the question. Kenneth Talanian - Evercore ISI : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, our next question is from Walter Prichard from Citi. Your line is now open. Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): Thanks. Just a quick question, follow-up on an earlier question on the long-term deferred. Can you help us understand maybe how much of that is macro-related with customers feeling better about budget and how much of that is a factor of the mix into the enterprise? And in terms of what could drive that to go higher, what would be the drivers from here? Sounds like that's your expectation. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think that if you look at what enterprise \u2013 this is Keith, I'm sorry. If you look at what I'll call the incumbents in the enterprise, you're probably seeing contract terms that are closer to three years. We're obviously at 26 months as I noted. To the extent that we continue to have more and more success in that enterprise segment of the market, I would expect that their buying pattern and \u2013 I think we've talked about this before, the fact that they're going to want to do three-year contracts and in many cases they're going to want to do five-year contracts. So I think that's where the pressure comes from, it's lined up with the success of the push into the enterprise. Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): And then could you comment on the fabric around things like endpoint and email? You haven't mentioned those. It sounds like it's been SD-WAN and switching and so forth and wireless, but how are those products doing? Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Things are growing more strong and it's a part of the fabric solution, we do see similar growth, it's a pretty good growth. Keith F. Jensen - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, I think, mail, specifically, let me check my numbers real quick, but I think mail had a very good quarter. I would just put that in the tier right below access switches, analyzer and access point switches and analyzers. Ken Xie - Fortinet, Inc.: Yeah, but also, the endpoint and also the SIM and also the acquisition we have with ZoneFox also will help in endpoint and for the SIM growth. Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe): Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski - Fortinet, Inc.: Thank you, Gigi. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and let you know that management will be presenting at the following technology conferences during the fourth quarter and we'll be at the UBS Conference here in San Francisco on November 12, the NASDAQ Conference in London on December 4, and then back to San Francisco for a December 6 conference with Barclays. We look forward to seeing all of you at those conferences. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. I'm pleased with the strong fourth quarter results. Billings increased 22% to $649 million and revenue was up 22% to $507 million driven by solid growth in both American and EMEA. Our non-GAAP operation margin for the quarter was 26%. For the full year billing increased 20% to $2.15 billion and revenue was up 20% to $1.8 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased to 22%. On a GAAP basis operating income more than doubled to $231 million and our GAAP operating margin increased to 13%. Our superior technology and broad Security Fabric architect contribute to the market share gain in 2018. The improved sales, marketing and continued investment in our channel also contributed to our growth. According to a recent Gartner survey, 72% of respondents said that security was their topmost concern when it come to one deployment. Fortinet base operates secured SD-WAN with building and next generation firewall continued to gain significant traction across geographies and market segment. In the fourth quarter, Fortinet signed a seven-figure deal with Backmine [ph], a European retailer with 4,000 stores in 26 countries. We displaced a competitor as a result of our ability to provide integrated SD-WAN functionality and security in a single device. Fortinet has received the most reviews of our vendors in the Gartner peer insight for SD-WAN and more than double in the other vendor. So we expect strong adoption of our secure SD-WAN offering for the next several years. During the fourth quarter, Fortinet and Symantec announced a partnership agreement to provide customers with the industry most comprehensive and robust security solutions across endpoint network and cloud environments. Today, we announced the release of a new series of the high performance FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls the new E-series, including a FortiGate 3,600E, 3,400E, 600E and the 400E, which delivers a combination of up to 30-gigabits per second protection and the 34-gigabit per second SSL inspection performance. Additionally, the E-series enable organizations to implement Intent-based Segmentation, providing smooth access control, continuous trough assessment, end-to-end visibility, and automated threat protection. While 2018 may have benefited from the current enterprise product refresh cycle, we expect continued growth over the next few years due to three main drivers. First, our portfolio of integrated secured SD-WAN and 5G products, which position us well to take advantage of the transition to edge and cloud computing. Second, Fortinet's Secure Fabric offered the most-broad, automated and integrated security for end-to-end protection as our nation consolidate towards a single security vendor. And third, our security processor unit, SPU, ASIC technology, and a new high performance E-series product announced today, provide us with continued competitive advantage. Our SPU technology delivers 10x the performance of other several approaches. Over the next few quarters, we expect to increase our competitive advantage even more with the announcement of a new System-on-a-Chip, SPU and the network processor SPU chip integrated with new product for both cloud and edge computing. For 2019, we expect to generate another year of better-than-market growth, balanced with profitability. We are excited about significant opportunity ahead, and we will continue to invest our business while maintaining our goal of 25% operating margin by 2022. I want to thank the Fortinet team, our partners, and their ongoing hard work for customers for their support. Now, I will turn the call over to Keith for a closer look and our fourth quarter and the full year performance and our first quarter of 2019 guidance. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Before I start, I'd like to note except for revenue, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are based on comparisons to the prior-year period unless otherwise stated. Slide references. I make refer before the presentation posted on our Investor Relations website I'd like to now provide a summary of our solid fourth quarter performance. Total revenue of $507 million was up 22%. Product revenue of $201 million was up 24%. Excluding a net benefit of $7 million from the revenue accounting change product revenue growth was 19%. Product revenue growth was driven by the new E-series products, software sales and growth in fabric platform solutions. Service revenue grew 20% to $306 million. FortiGuard our security subscription offering grew 19% to $165 million. With all other services including FortiCare our traditional support offering we're up 21% to $141 million. FortiCare which continues to benefit from customers transitioning from 8x5 to 24x7 supports was up 20% to $129 million. As our strong revenue growth illustrates, the partial U.S. Federal government shutdown as well as concerns raised by Brexit and the slowing Chinese economy had no noticeable impact on our fourth quarter performance. I would note our government vertical is well diversified and includes not only the U.S. Federal government but also state, local and international government agencies. Additionally, the U.K. and China are single countries within similarly diversified EMEA and APAC regions. Before moving on with the fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our revenue performance for the year. Total revenue for the full year grew 20% to $1.8 billion. Product revenue grew 17%. Service revenue grew 23%. Moving over the $1 billion mark for the first time and represented 63% of total revenue. At the end of the year, deferred revenue increased 26% to $1.7 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 22%. Returning to our fourth quarter Billings grew 22% to $649 million led by 23% growth in the Americas and EMEA, average contract length decreased by one month to 25 months. Service providers and MSSPs had a seasonally strong fourth quarter at 23% of fourth quarter billings. Service providers and MSSPs represented 11 of our top 25 deals in Q4 and include a seven-figure secure SD-WAN deal that included a customer acquiring over 20 high-end FortiGate products along with a range of other products and services. Billings to large enterprises excluding service providers and MSSPs continued to outpace overall business with growth of 26% on a trailing 12-month basis illustrating the strength of our enterprise business the number of deals over $1 million grew to a record 47 beating the previous record of 40 deals set in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the quarter we closed a seven-figure transaction with a European global 2,000 multinational financial services company to use our FortiGate products to focus on internal segmentation. Also more than $1 million plus wins last quarter was with a European-based supermarket chain that has 25% of the market share in the Netherlands. The combination of security and SD-WAN  functionality into a single form factor drove this competitor displacement. As part of the, of this transaction, the company purchased hundreds of entry-level FortiGates. Network security billings increased 20% and continued to represent three quarters of total billings. Billings for non-FortiGate products and services grew slightly faster than our FortiGate billings. The Security Fabric which is the largest component of our non-FortiGate offerings benefited from customer's recognition of our platform strategy, its value performance and integrated security. The Security Fabric includes software, secure switches and other hardware products and services. Secure switches are sold together with FortiGates and related services and represented 2% of total fourth quarter billings. Total cloud billings for our top five public cloud providers continued to experience growth in excess of 100%. Moving back to the income statement. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 75.7% was driven by the 40 basis point improvement in services gross margin to 87.3%. For the full year, gross margin was 76%, up 70 basis points from 2017. Fourth quarter operating margin increased to 25.8% or up 690 basis points. The operating margin included a 340 basis point benefit from the required commission on revenue accounting changes. Excluding the accounting change benefit, the fourth quarter operating margin would have increased to 22.4% or up 350 basis points. For the full year, the operating margin was 22.4%. Excluding the accounting change, the operating margin would have been, would have improved to 19%. Based on 605 Accounting the three-year trend of normalized annual operating margin improvement starting with 2016 stands at 190 basis points, 210 basis points and now 180 basis points for 2018. While improving our operating margin these 580 basis points over the last three years, revenue grew at a three-year compounded annual growth rate of 21%. As Ken mentioned in his prepared remarks we expect 2019 to be another year of better than market growth, balanced with increasing profitability. Slides 14 and 15 show a line by line comparison between our non-GAAP results and our non-GAAP, pardon me, our non-GAAP results and the non-GAAP results excluding the adoption of the new accounting rules for the fourth quarter and the full year. Total headcount at the end of the year was up 15% to 5,845. Net income for the fourth quarter was $105 million or $0.59 per diluted share, up 84%. Net income for the full year was $320 million or $1.84 per diluted share, up 77% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, we reported full year net income of $332 million or $1.91 per diluted share. The diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 175.8 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Moving to the statement of cash flows summarized on slides 10 and 11. Free cash flow was $169 million, up 17% year-over-year. For 2018, free cash flow increased 28% to $586 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares, totaling $92 million. For the full year, we repurchased 3.8 million shares, totaling $209 million. We're outgrowing our Sunnyvale office space and are constructing the second building adjacent to our existing building, which we expect to occupy in the second half of 2020. Including spending on this project, we expect total first quarter capital expenditures to be between $15 million and $20 million, and total full year capital expenditures to be between $120 million and $140 million. As I turn to the guidance provided on slide 13, I'd like to remind everyone that the forward-looking disclaimer Peter presented at the start of the call applies to the guidance I'm about to provide. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $515 million to $535 million, revenue in the range of $465 million to $475 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 18% to 18.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.39 which assumes a share count of between 176 million and 178 million shares. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. We are closely watching why the reported concerns of potential softening of global economies. With that said it is important to note that we are seeing healthy pipeline growth in our business and we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow faster than the security market in 2019. For 2019, we expect billings in the range of $2,450 million to $2,500 million, revenue in the range of $2,060 million to $2,100 million; total service revenue in the range of $1,330 million to $1,360 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.05 to $2.10 which assumes a share count of between 180 million and 183 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24%. We expect cash taxes to be between $53 million and $59 million. As this guidance indicates, we remain committed to balancing growth with increasing profitability as we work to achieve our non-GAAP operating margin goal of 25% for 2022. Before I turn the call back over to Peter, we like to thank our partner\u2019s, customers and the Fortinet team for all the support and hard work. I'll now hand the call back to Peter. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Operator, we're ready to start the Q&A session please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the ongoing solid performance and guide. Ken or Keith, so the product breadth is undoubtedly noticeable from a channel perspective whether it's SD-WAN, some 5G-related transactions, the NAC and as well as the new E-series products, and you guys are moving in all market direction and all infrastructures. Now we'll view Fortinet as a pure place security company, but maybe we should start thinking of Fortinet as becoming more of an infrastructure play. Just maybe high level, how do you think about it? Ken Xie : Yeah. This is Ken. We still want to focus ourselves as a security company, especially now with security. But the security as a percentage of IT spend in to keep increase high percentage because security addressing the application content the user device and region level, which that the basic networking cannot address. So all this becomes much more important with the wider the 5G SD-WAN the data transformation. And what's unique about Fortinet, we also when we design a security we want to design in into the infrastructure like about 10 years ago we started design the Wi-Fi controller within FortiGate. And then four years, five years ago designed the SD-WAN controller inside of FortiGate. And also going forward the 5G designed within security. That's where -- so we basically, you can look at the FortiGate product, which we designed actually to incorporate some of the infrastructure function, which is very, very important for a lot of service providers and also for enterprise. And then for them to design the infrastructure together with security, inside our add-on security later. So that gives us a huge advantage like when there's a new infrastructure keep expanding like all the SD-WAN going forward the 5G and also working closely with service provider, widening the cloud and edge computing and also IoT/OT security. So that's the advantage we have. And we do think in more long-term for what security the infrastructure should be and then starting invest in R&D early. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And maybe one for Keith just as we think about the channel, the partner strategy the way you've been compensating partners and advisors pretty much the same dynamics that we've been seeing in recent quarters, recent years or have you been seeing any change or implementing any change? Thank you for that. Keith Jensen : I think when I talk to the channel leadership team, I think I probably described the last six months to 12 months as being one that was more focused on individual segments of the channel whether that was SMB, MSSP even the larger parts of the channel. And I think that programs are probably more tailored now, whether they are resellers or distributors. And I think the programs, when I say, tailored are probably more targeted in terms of where we're seeing the performance from our channel partners. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open. Jonathan Ho : Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to start out with maybe some additional color on your SD-WAN driven deals. Can you maybe talk about what percentage of the new deals are now coming and sort of influenced by this SD-WAN demand? Ken Xie : I don't know we have the detail data for that. But definitely we see the pipeline increase more quickly different from other SD-WAN player, which they only have SD-WAN function. We designed with security which is the top concern for all the WAN expansion. And at the same time this also other, we see other strong drivers for the future growth in the next few years, even beyond the refresh from underpriced network and security which probably will last a few more quarters. But for this expanding into SD-WAN into 5G will be at least a few more years. It will keep growing and then we are very uniquely positioned and has that design just a few years ago and that we started benefit from early investment. Jonathan Ho : Got it. And then, with regards to your new intention based firewall, can you talk a little bit about how that differs from a traditional next-generation firewall? And maybe how does this new firewall fit within the emerging zero trust models? Ken Xie : Yeah, the traditional firewall unit deployed in a, on the corporate enterprise edge and the border, so there's a trust in the zone and there's trust outside zone there. But this intent base segmentation just can deploy whatever the inside enterprise next to the server, next to the data center, next to the segment department and also some other device, which this, this had to be deployed at high-speed LAN environment compared to before the traditional firewall, once I connect the WAN, how do I connect the LAN. So this is ready high-speed, easy deployment and also leverage a lot of AI machine learning to automate the [indiscernible] intrusion, also the internal security issue which come as a majority of security concern now. So that's where it's how to move inside into the enterprise and also how to deal with the high-speed environment in automated response way. That's how this, the new E-Series are addressing right now. So, we see a quite big ramp, quite quick ramp because this can give the whole infrastructure security, just some kind of border security. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So, Ken, I appreciate the commentary around fabric and especially the long opportunity that still in front of you. But my sense is that still the biggest portion of the business quarter in and quarter out at the moment is still kind the core traditional network security. And I'm curious in the enterprise the deals that you're winning, what do you hearing as the main drivers? Is it just a straight outperformance of speeds and feeds? Is it the integration you know, across your portfolio? Or you know, the breadth of your product offering or some combination thereof? Ken Xie : The speed starting to become more and more important whether with the speed for the whole infrastructure increased 5G or internal segmentation deployment. So that's where we see more and more the mandate. And also when we also mentioned because the fabric also impose in both some of the switch, some of the Wi-Fi access AP, so that because all of this will be part of the total infrastructure. And the traditional firewall starting kind of being replaced we call the Third Generation so infrastructure security had to address both inside enterprise and the cloud, mobile endpoint altogether. So some of them we kind of innovate designed internally, somewhat we partner with some other partner like Symantec and other two to address the whole thing together within the whole industry. So that's where we see the transition is kind of a different than the part. You have to have a different part of infrastructure working closer together to integrate, to automate together. So that's where, especially the enterprise we start to see some consolidation going on. That\u2019s we feel is our other drivers, so we do have the fabric approach both working with our own product and also working with the partner product together. So we feel this change will last for a few more years. And because this is different than the last time like four, five years ago replacing the traditional firewall with -- firewall UTM, now it\u2019s ready the whole infrastructure needs to be secured altogether. Keith Jensen : This is Keith. Let me just add -- a little more context, if you look at a couple of verticals, when I talk to the sales leadership with Ken, I think in the financial services, you're seeing ROI in speed to be top of the list. And another one would be retail. I think that you're seeing SD-WAN in branches as we top off the list. Sterling Auty : And then if I look at the DSOs in the quarter, I think it popped up a bit. Is that an indication of the linearity and more back-end loaded? Or was there some other driver to it? Because I'm looking at that as well as kind of the first quarter guide and just wondering if there's any read through here? Keith Jensen : No I think the -- for comparability purposes, I think we lose a day because of the conversion from 605 to 606. But I don't think -- I did notice last year -- last year being 2017, Europe finished up very early in the quarter and went after the holidays. I think both are working throughout December on both sides of the ocean this time. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then last one if I could sneak it in, as you think about how you\u2019ve laid out the guidance for 2019, where would you say the points of the toughest comparison are through the year and how would you kind of characterize the seasonality of the guidance first half versus second half versus your traditional business? Keith Jensen : I think the headline is that 2019 guidance looks a lot like 2018 guidance in terms of where we started, whether that's on the top line and whether that's on the growth. I think our pipeline, we feel very good about the pipeline that we're looking at the moment. And you know there's a certain note of caution and some of the things that I mentioned in the script, not necessarily directly relevant to us, but I think we're watching the spillover impact. But to come back to your original question, I think the model for 2019 looks a lot like the model did for 2018 in terms of the timing of things. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is now open. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I have two for Keith. Keith, the first one is just around your implied product revenue guidance. So if I did my math right, I'm shaking out maybe a little bit ahead of where we were expecting anyway. So I wanted to plug into that and maybe get a sense of what you -- what has given you confidence around that product growth trajectory. And as an extension as we sort of lapse some of the tax reform impacts of 2018 as we are lapping some of the specific incentives into your sales capacity that you provided for product growth in 2018, to what extent are we sort of lapping that? And sort of normalizing those effects and the follow-up as well? Keith Jensen : So kind of taking your last point first. I've continue to think that a comment we made very early in last year about the changing 50 comp plans is probably having an overblown impact. For people it's not doing what people are suggesting it is. But to your original point, I think we look at our pipeline, we feel very good about what we're seeing in terms of the business. I don't think there's something that we're seeing that's evidence of a slowdown. We feel very good about the things that are coming online as we move through the year, whether that's the new product offerings for the 3400 that we talked about, the 400 product offerings, the SD-WAN products and what we're seeing there. And I'll try to expand on the comment that was made I think we were talking to Jonathan a moment ago. I would offer that when I benchmark the pipeline growth of SD-WAN against other solutions, if you will, it benchmarks pipeline growth, benchmarks very well against other growth that we see. When I followed out and benchmarked that against the close rate, again, it benchmarks well when we compared to other parts of the business. So I think there's a lot of calluses we move through the year. Fatima Boolani : That's really helpful. And just around your service provider business does that sort of snap back to some of your historically higher level as a proportion of billings. I think you said 23%. But at the same time, we picked up medium more cautious tone from some of your tech peers around data center spending and service providers spending posture. So what is really driving that momentum for you? And really how are you sort of bucking that trend that we've picked up negatively from some of the other tech peers? And that's it for me. Thank you. Ken Xie : Yeah. This is Ken. First, I think the service provider will start in play more and more important role in the security space. And also with the expanding of infrastructure SD-WAN 5G, so a few that -- the next few years would also be more strong for service provider keeping expanding their own infrastructure services and also add a security service. It's also interesting. Service providers, it\u2019s a biggest sector for us. We are supporting them from -- or beginning more than 10 years. We can see that there is the trend going on there already, security become a high percentage. And I know sometimes like a few years ago, whether suddenly move with the cloud or something kind of a slowdown of the 5G whatever not quite there yet, slowdown the service providers spending a little bit. But since that entire round, so that's probably will be our strong driver for the next few years. And we also have all the product, all other service timing this very good and we feel pretty confidence give us additional growth driver for the next few years beyond the enterprise kind of refresh. Because we design all this whether SPU ASIC technology, the new product, the SD-WAN, the 5G security. Eventually it will benefit all the service provider, all enterprise customer a lot is none of the other strong competitor actually kind of internal develop or integrate as good as we are for this kind of security function with infrastructure function and also closely working with service provider for more than 10 years. So that gives us a pretty good confidence for the next few year's growth. Fatima Boolani : That's very helpful. Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] in for Melissa. I had a quick follow-up to a question that was asked earlier on the product revenue guidance for 2019. I think by my math implies about 9% growth. To what extent does that reflect the moderation base on some of the lapping effects that were mentioned earlier versus just general caution on some of the macro factors? Whether it be tariffs or China or whatever else? Ken Xie : Yeah, I think the focus is more on the latter than it is on the former. But I mean, I think again, I think the pipeline that we're looking at looks very, very strong. And whether that's an SD-WAN use case which I talked about which is going very well. Very excited about seeing the new 400, 600E products building out, the midrange product family plus the 3400, the 3600 that Ken just talked about and the new functionality that that's bringing along. I think what we really like to do here is kind of watch what happens with the U.S. government Brexit and the exit whether they're going to crash out or not and China's well. And again, I don't feel that we have large exposures in any of those geographies, in fact the quite small. But it's more kind of wonder off they're going through this process could those things start spilling over into the larger economies. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Got it. And then on the tariff impact, to what extent was that negative or even a positive impact for you in Q4? We did pick up some of our, and some of our checks that there were customers pulling forward spend in advance of price increases. So, I was wondering if you notice any of that this past quarter. And that's It for me. Ken Xie : Had not heard that and the tariffs impact are very small subset of our products. So, I would be surprised if we actually, if, it may be happen to other vendors, but I would not be expect that to see it happen here and we're not changing prices around tariff, so I didn't know that they would even had that incentive for, for Fortinet products. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you and congrats on the nice quarter. I just wanted to ask a question on the service provider segment. You know, clearly strong results this quarter and I was just trying to determine I guess how sustainable that is going forward? And if you could just weave in maybe sort of any update on the competitive landscape and that space given that [indiscernible] recently launched a new appliance targeted at the service provider segment? Keith Jensen : I'll kick it off and hand over to Ken for the hard part. Yeah, I think the service provider has always been a very strong part of our business. It's also been one that as a percentage of business, it's been fairly lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Q4 is typically a very good quarter for the service provider part of our business. So, we're very pleased with the results. I think in the quarter itself, we had historically done very well with MSSP segment of that business, as well as the infrastructure, and we saw deals in both part of that business in the quarter. Ken Xie : Yeah, so service provider they are, first very long, of our sales cycle I mean, probably one to two years to sell into service provider. And also they need to have environment more high performance and also more reliable environment. And also it's a very technical buy. It's different than some competitor using the marketing power to influence some of the nano tech buying enterprise, but service provider they have to be fully test the product and both himself and also the third party validation. So that's where we looking the service provider for more than 10 years and pretty much all the service provider, major service provider customer and working very close with them and also design function feature within many years together different in some other competitors announced they have product with service provider, but have not seen anything come out get. And then on the other side is like with SD-WAN, with a flagship with the new progress in the infrastructure there's also a lot of opportunity and the security becomes more complex for the enterprise and the service provider actually can provide additional value-added service. So that's where we are behind the service provider to support in their future growth in a security space. And so we do expect, I think it is also some sort of like I said it's really a lot of high-end product for the core and also could be a lot of edge computing like relate to IoT and some other part. So they need both the high end and also the edge product working together and so we have the advantage of that. And also like that the product we mentioned in the early call whether the 5000, the 7000, we have been shipping that product for a couple of years already meaning few years already. And so they -- rather need some time to get in the space and we don't see many of our competitors come close with the position we have today. Andrew Nowinski : Great thank you. And then maybe from a geographic perspective, you had fairly similar growth across all regions in 2018 on an annual basis. And so as I look at your 2019 outlook, should we again expect balanced growth across all regions in 2019? Keith Jensen : Yes I mean that's how we\u2019ve sign up the quarter. We're very pleased with the consistent execution across the geographies particularly in the fourth quarter in different parts of the business. But yes that's how we model the business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Great, thanks so much and congrats on a great Q4 guys. I've got two questions. First, again on service provider was a bright spot this quarter. And you caught up the opportunity in 5G and edge use cases as a key opportunity for you. And can you maybe talk about the demand for your virtual appliance in that market and perhaps more broadly and how was the shift to virtual compared to your expectations maybe one year or two ago? And what do you think that looks like into the future? Ken Xie : Yes, we also have a huge advantage on the virtue and also we also call the virtue SPU. So that's the architecture we're using with a lot of our call provider in some virtual environment. At the same time, they also need to secure a core whether the data center or the cloud. And then together with the edge which also needs some kind of appliance in edge in the field there. So that's where you can see both the cloud the virtual growing quite well. And we also -- we kind of offer, we called the [indiscernible] integration with moldable cloud provider, with a more broad function then other competitor which give us more advantage. There is also a part of the fabric solution. So that's where -- whether you go to the cloud or virtual, you also need to make sure different applications and also different call provider working together to help customers solve the issue. So that's where we do the integration much better and also more broad offering compared to some of the competitors. So that's where we combined the virtue is the physical together is the advantage we offer to service provider. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. That's actually very helpful. And Ken, we keep hearing great things about your product from the channel. And I feel like everybody likes to focus on some of the other very large public companies in network security. But I'd be curious if you can share any observations about some of the other ones that are often times forgotten about names like sonic wall or watch guard. What you see -- do you ultimately believe that the lower end of the market or the smaller players out there eventually get consolidated? And are you coming across them in the field competitively? Thanks. Ken Xie : There's a two-part. First the security is more dynamic environment been in security for almost 30 years. You need to keep up the innovation. So that \u2013 if some of the companies to slow on innovation or cannot follow the trend, then the growth will be slowed down or even have to depend on acquired company to growth. And then acquired company the challenge really how this acquired company as a moderate to integrate with existing function, existing product. That's always a challenge for some of the bigger company. So some of the other smaller player actually, once they can already reached sort in size, the investment like whether like we spend billions of dollars in the ASIC technology, for the SPU and also the economy on scale also starting working well. So that's also making some of the smaller competitor has less, less advantage. With security reach higher speed, more broad offering so that's where the consolidation also start happening in the space. So I feel somewhat a smaller competitor probably start losing some of the age there. And they're still a lot of new niche market. That's for every year, there's a lot of new company come up to the space, play some of the new function, new application, new niche. But the issue is really the niche market can only address some part of enterprise. They cannot expand and cannot integrate, cannot improve the performance then they have difficult time to grow beyond like $100 million or $1 billion in there. So that's where we see some of the old company, long-term companies starting slower on some of the innovation and also the growth. And we feel that with the consolidation going on probably we're now looking more good for some of these companies. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate you guys taking my question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Two questions for Keith here. Just on the Q1 seasonality, it did feel like you had a pretty strong fourth quarter and the Q1 seasonality especially on billing seems a little bit light of what it usually is if I look Q4 to Q1 is a simple explanation there is the strength in Q4? And then had a follow-up on another metric? Keith Jensen : Yeah. It is just a very strong performance that we had the fourth quarter. Clearly, an outperformance. Walter Pritchard : Great. And then you to did talk about I think 2% of the revenue was from switches. Could you maybe I don\u2019t know if that's the largest of the kind of non-security products? Maybe you could help us understand all-in the phones and cameras and the access points and any other things that weren't excluded in the 2%? How much of either product revenue or total revenue is represented by non-security products? Keith Jensen : Yeah. So I think kind of piece of that non-FortiGate includes secure fabric, which is the lion share of what you're talking about. It also includes other things professional service, training. We actually include phones and cameras and perhaps the 4010. I'm not sure in that particular group. But coming back to what really makes up secure access, secure fabric, switches are the pure of products. It's the largest of the products. So what you have it remains is 10 to 11, 12 different solutions that we offer in both hardware and software. And one metric, I would offer if you total up all the software billing in secure access, they're much greater than the secure switch billings are. And I think when you start looking at our -- when we start talking about our margins and while we\u2019re pleased with what secure switches bring to us as part of a deal in terms of the product margin, we understand that it does not attach quite as much service, but it\u2019s not a drain on margins on so some people may think. And also keep in mind in that particular product suite, I just described, software is much larger than switches and it's generating a lot more margin for us. Ken Xie : Yeah, also I want to clear as well. We don't sell the switch separately and all of the record of FortiSwitch sales with FortiGate together, so basically FortiGate control the switch and some resolution segmentation and also sometimes just some kind of whatever control function there also. So that's where has all the security function inside the switch and working with FortiGate, but switches not sold separately. It's a part of the recorded fabric solution. And that's together with some other, the web security, email security and plus security all together. So basically it\u2019s had to be sold together instead of sold separately. So that's the switch is ready, we don't sell switch separately. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks, Ken. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Gabriela Borges : Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Either for Ken or for Keith, I think there was a little bit of earlier color on plans for the channel this year. I was hoping you could also elaborate on your plans for hiring for the internal sales force, how you're thinking about the pace of hiring versus last year where are you prioritizing adding headcount? And for Keith, any color on productivity assumptions for those would be really helpful. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Sure. Let's start going in reverse order. Productivity assumptions, we had very strong productivity, particularly in the fourth quarter of last year of the sales team. I have not, to be cautious I'm not modeling sales productivity into the guidance, increases if you will. So I think that's an appropriate way to go about it. I think in terms of where we're adding salespeople, and in terms of the pace of hiring, perhaps it's a little bit behind our revenue growth number and we're trying to keep our sales hiring aligned up with the revenue growth number. And where we're actually targeting is as we've talked before is as we continue this expansion into the enterprise, I think one of our first areas of interest is finding experienced enterprise salespeople and bringing them on board. That's not to say we're not investing in other places and certainly the channel as I alluded to earlier as we continue to maintain and grow the leadership position in the SMB and the channel business, you're seeing investments there as well, as well as the carrier MSSP and the commercial segment of the business. But I would say kind of in the order that I gave in terms of priorities. Gabriela Borges : That's very helpful. Yes, please. Keith Jensen : Yeah, we also, well, keeping in the market in both in the like with the pipeline and also have like a seasonal level kind of like influence there. And I think that's where we see one of the fast growing here for us really the enterprise, especially enterprise in the U.S. So we're, we come from a relatively small base, but we are keeping volume much faster than other competitor and also about company average. So we're keeping investing in that area. And that's also we have a better tool to tracking whether that's the [indiscernible] whatever all the tool starting working together and gave us better visibility for the pipeline, for productivity and also how to kind of different investments, see how they return for each investment, so I think we're starting, I try to be more efficient going forward. Gabriela Borges : That's helpful. Thank you. And the follow-up is referring back to the prepared remarks. So Ken, you mentioned 2018 was a good refresh year and then you mentioned a few really interesting company specific drivers for Fortinet going to 2019. I always thought the refresh was interesting because it gives you a foothold to try to displace competitors as changes happening in customer environments. I'd love to understand how you're thinking about the refresh piece of this going into 2019 at the end of your level? Thank you. Ken Xie : Yeah the first -- the refresh I keep mentioning it's more on the enterprise space. So we're relatively small compared to other competitor in enterprise that grow much faster. So we're -- and also the refresh, it's different not as replacing the edge firewall or the traditional firewall with new firewall. But it's already tried to consolidation and also integrate different pieces together. So that's what it last a little bit longer and also making the deal, also bigger if you have more broad offering of compound partners under different player in the space. So we feel the enterprise refresh probably will continue for a few more quarters and even maybe a couple of more years because all this consolidation and also market product working together we keep doing that. And then we also keep growing enterprise space above average. On the other side, we also see the new infrastructure that we mentioned SD-WAN, the 5G and the service provider play bigger role more percentage into the space also helping driving. And also the timing of our new product, new SPU ASIC chip also very good because it takes us three to four years to design. And since that is finally coming out now and that we also benefit for all of these. That's where I mentioned that's a three drivers that will keep us growing because the broad product on the fabric more integrate to feed enterprise consolidation integration and also the new product and also the 5G SD-WAN in the service provider I think the three drivers beyond the refresh and I think we will help us on that growth for the next few years. Gabriela Borges : I appreciate all the detail. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Byrd with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Michael Byrd : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask real quick on the Federal piece. I know in the quarter you mentioned that it wasn't a material impact. But looking at the guidance even through the entirety of fiscal 2019, what are you seeing in terms of the pipeline? Are things getting pushed? Or are the sales cycles being extended? Or how can I think about the Federal piece of the business given the shutdown? Keith Jensen : So I think the -- to kind of frame it up first of all, I think some time ago we disclose the Federal army, the government vertical. It was pardon me 15, it was probably the second or third largest vertical, but it includes not only the U.S. Federal which is probably the smallest part, but also include state, local and international government into this as well. So in terms of a direct impact to the Federal shutdown together with the fact I think seven of the nine agencies were funded given the size of the Federal government is to our particular business very unconcerned about it. My concern stands from if this thing -- if we continue to go, if we close it down and start becoming a much broader economic issue than I\u2019ve concerns about it. Michael Byrd : Okay. And then a quick follow-up, how big of a business can I think about Fortinet going into the core of the data center? We see some weakness in peers. How can I think about you guys talking to the data center? Ken Xie : I don't think much slowdown in the data center. But we're mostly working with service provider both sell into some of the infrastructure and also service then as a service provider offer secure service to their customer, because we launched the product like the high-end 6000, 7000 series probably like one to two years ago. And since starting to ramp up, we have not seen the data centers slow down. Keith anything? Keith Jensen : Yeah. We\u2019re both pausing, because we\u2019ve not -- neither one of us really have any data that suggests there is a slowdown. If you're talking about the cloud providers and some of their plans or something like that. But regardless it doesn't -- we're not seeing something impacting our business. Michael Byrd : Okay. Great to know. That's it from me. Thank you very much. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Daniel Ives : Yeah. Thanks. A lot of the questions have been asked. But I guess maybe to frame it, I know there's a lot of naysayers including many on the call on your growth. You continue to defy the skeptics. What do you think investors are missing, especially on the large deal size in terms of what you guys are doing which competition as well as maybe looking going forward the growth opportunity versus I think some of the noise out there? I'll just frame it from there. Ken Xie : For me as a engineer because we do invest in some other long-term innovation and like from the SPU ASIC chip level to with some infrastructure, some other things and also try to see how the next five years to 10 years we may keeping improving position and make a difference in a space. So that's where some time could be too technical, could take a long time to explain to some of the investor. So they are obviously talking about, some time I\u2019ve got too deep too technical. So that's part I still feel has a lot of value a lot of potential and also different in some other competitor a little bit more short-term, some more finance focused. But we're more focused in the technology, the long-term make a big impact into the space. So that's the result as whether the innovation like the patent we have like just reached over 600 patents, most of them internal innovation. And also the new product and a lot of new technology function there. But like I said, so we are market in winning the technical buyers space, whether in the Fortune 100 company SP 100, I think we have 90 of the SP 100 and also the service provider, which is very technical player. And also the third-party testing from assets from some other, you can see wherever there is IP testing going on we're doing quite well. But compared to some of the other competitor more on the marketing or some other sell side, we're very improving ourselves. But at the same time we're also keeping the innovation culture we have. And also keeping invest in the technology and the product. So that's where we'll be. And then at the same time we also want to balance the growth and with margin, right, there\u2019s no lack of growth without costs, pushing money and keeping \u2013 pushing money on the CapEx. So we want to keep in some balance on the growth and some of the margin both on the GAAP and non-GAAP cash flow base. So that's where from a shareholder return a lot, so this year will be our 10-year anniversary of IPO. So the evaluation will grow more than 10x in the last 10 years. So that's where we also kind of we view sometimes you may need to looking back, looking forward for a long time to see some of the strategy we planned. Daniel Ives : Sure. Keith Jensen : I will take that. I would offer that probably echo what Ken said I think. One, clearly, we're executing on a balanced growth approach, right? We're balancing adding to the top line, adding to the bottom line. And I think that you know, when I look at the founders of the company, the long-term investors and I think that plays very well with them. And I think also the experience, so I think people sometimes undersell the experience that we have in the technology side with the founders and others where the direction of the, of the market is going over perhaps a longer period of time than perhaps looking at 90-day cycles. Daniel Ives : That's great. And just on 5G, I mean, especially if we look at where that's going the next 18 to 24 months. I mean, do you feel like that's a clear competitive advantage you have especially just given the technology and where you guys play going forward? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yeah, that's why you have to drive the growth for the next few years, even five to 10 years because there's a core and how to secure a really to the cloud side and the core data center side. And then because of our high speed application and also how to secure edge relate to all this IoT OT and how this like virtual combined with the physical and so that is that. And also see, the 5G also more applied by SDN, the software-defined networking and also kind of maybe related to the investment we made almost 10 years ago in the Wi-Fi combined with Wi-Fi controller inside FortiGate and then four, five years ago started for SDN. So SD-WAN controller inside FortiGate. So all this has to be combined together to play the 5G and also need at least like five to 10 years investment and also continue working with service provider with different part of infrastructure to play the 5G. And also even some different vertical has a different requirement so different application, different like related to different kind of IoT vertical. It's quite a complicated, but also need long-term investment and also need the design together like also, we had for designed security and infrastructure together and also, also 5G has to be in there like not just above part of for a few weeks or a few months then you have something come out. It really has to take years of investment. And also combined with technology, the other part working with service provider for years to come up the solution. So that's where we feel pretty confident about the 5G and will help drive for the next probably five to 10 years. Daniel Ives : Awesome. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. So, with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Andrew. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. And let you know that management will be presenting at the following technology conferences during the first quarter. It will be the Goldman Sachs Conference on February 12 and the Morgan Stanley Conference on February 25. Those conferences are being held in San Francisco. So we look forward to seeing many of you in the Bay Area. If you have follow-up questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Crystal. Good afternoon, everyone. This is the Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I'm pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the first quarter of 2019. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results and conclude by providing our guidance for the second quarter of 2019 before opening up the call for questions. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please keep your questions brief and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to allow others to participate. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that on today's call we will be making forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the day of this presentation and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also all references to financial metrics that are made on today's call are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Lastly all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. We are pleased with our strong first quarter results. Billings increased 19% or $552 million and then revenue was up 18% or $473 million, driven by solid growth in service revenue. In April, Fortinet hold its annual Accelerate 2019 conference. This year's event was a huge success, with turnout in customer attendees up over 37% from last year. At Accelerate, Fortinet management described external trends impacting the security landscape and define how Fortinet is best positioned within this trend for future growth. The internal trust room has disappeared. A state of trouble offset company network to mobile to the edge and to the cloud, security has followed the data flow and applications between networks device and users. As a result, security and networking are converging into what Fortinet calls security-driven networking. We believe this trend is accelerating the security industry move into the third generation of infrastructure network security. Security requires 10x to 100x more computing power compared to networking for the same network throughput. This requirement makes network security slower and more expensive. Fortinet SPU ASIC technology delivers 10x the performance of other software approaches, eliminating the performance gap and a lower cost than our competition. At Accelerate we announced the industry's first SD-WAN ASIC the FortiSPU SoC4 available in the FortiGate 100F, the next generation firewall. The 100F provide SD-WAN functionality and advanced security in a single appliance with high-performance. As our relations consolidate towards few vendors, our security cyber approach with its open API and connected technology has experienced increased adoption by enterprise customers. We continue to grow our ecosystem of more than 57 fiber-ready partners to one of the largest in the industry including a close partnership with Symantec. The explosion of IoT and immersive technology are accelerating the movement of data and computing to the age. According to Gartner, 70% to 80% of each data never gets the data center to be processed. And within the next two years 40% of large enterprise will integrate edge computing up from 1% in 2017. The ability to offer security through the networking focused on provision and the edge is low latency and high performance is critical, especially with the deployment of 5G network. Fortinet provides the broadest set of security solutions for both the edge and multi-cloud environment. We continue to progress in driving innovation and accelerate the announced Forti OS 6.2 with more than 300 new innovations. This innovation include the artificial intelligence and machine-learning ability for protection from the edge to the network core and across multi-cloud environments. In addition to our investment in innovation, we continue to make sales, marketing and channel investment. We expect to spend on cybersecurity as a percentage of all IT budget to continue to grow. This increase in spending coupled with three key drivers positions Fortinet for faster growth than the market over the next few years. First with a portfolio of integrate secure WiFi SD-WAN and 5G product, we're leading the transition to the security-driven networking. Second, Fortinet security fairly offers the most broad, automated and integrated security for end-to-end protection as automation consolidate towards a few security vendors. And third, our SPU, ASIC technology, provide us with continued cost and performance competitive advantage. Our advantage has increased this recent announcement of new SD-WAN ASIC, the FortiSPU SoC4. I want to thank the Fortinet team and our partner for their ongoing hard work and our customer for their support. Now I will turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our first quarter performance and our second quarter of 2019 guidance. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Before I start, I'd like to note except for revenue, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are based on comparisons to the first quarter of 2018 unless otherwise stated. The slide references I make reference to the presentation posted on the Investor Relations website. I'd now like to provide a summary of our strong first quarter performance. Total revenue of $473 million was up 18%, driven by strength in EMEA and APAC. Product revenue of $163 million was up 14%. Growth was driven by a mix shift to the midrange FortiGates and increasing software revenue. Service revenue grew 21% to $310 million and was driven by a 24% increase in FortiGuard security subscriptions to $170 million. FortiCare technical support and other services increased 17% to $140 million. About 60% of total first quarter revenue was provided by the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the quarter, providing a high level of revenue predictability. In the second quarter, we expect a similar percentage of our total revenue to come from our existing deferred revenue balance. Total deferred revenue increased 26% to $1.8 billion, short-term deferred revenue increased 21% to $991 million. Now turning to Billings. Billings grew 19% to $552 million, benefiting from strong growth in the Japan and APAC regions. Average contract term was flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year at 25 months. Service providers and MSSPs remained one of our top customer segments accounting for 40% of our top 25 deals in the quarter. There were 35 deals over $1 million in the quarter versus 34 in the year-ago period. The dollar value of the deals over $1 million increased 20%. In the quarter, we closed a seven-figure operational technology-focused transaction with an EMEA based power and water utility company. The deal included FortiGates, secure SD-WAN capabilities and centralized management functionality enabling visibility and integration with a customer's OT network. In the Americas, we closed a seven-figure secure SD-WAN deal with a major school district. We won this deal due to the ability of our solution to provide direct Internet connectivity to each of the school district's 80,000 students along with simple management and simple deployment and importantly the integration of our solution with existing third-party security technologies. FortiGate products and service billings increased 17% and accounted for three quarters of total billings. Billings for non-FortiGate products and services grew faster than FortiGate billings. Benefiting from our strong growth in FortiGate virtual machines and play-as-you-go billings, private and public cloud Billings outpaced infrastructure fabric billings. Infrastructure fabric is still the largest component of non-FortiGate offerings and benefited from strong growth in Latin America and APAC. The infrastructure fabric includes hardware software and services. Moving back to the income statement. First quarter gross margin improved 50 basis points to 77.2%. Driving the increase in total gross margin, services gross margin improved 130 basis points to 87.1%. Illustrating our commitment to better-than-industry average revenue growth. Headcount for sales and marketing at the end of the quarter was up 16%. Total headcount increased 14% to 6,015. Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 20.4% despite a decrease of 125 basis points and the commission benefit associated with last year's change in accounting. The operating margin improvement reflects the increase in gross margin, gains and operating leverage and increase sales productivity. Given the strong operating income performance, net income was $81 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 39% to $0.46. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $191 million, up 49% year-over-year. The increase reflects seasonally strong first quarter collections, continued inventory management, operating profit expansion that flowed through to net income and growing deferred revenue. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 779,000 shares for a total cost of $56 million on an average per-share price of just over $72. At the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $677.5 million, and is set to expire at the end of this year. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $10 million, below the low end of our guidance range. Including construction spending, we expected second quarter capital \u2013 we expect second quarter capital expenditures to be between $25 million and $35 million. We are maintaining our prior 2019 capital expenditures guidance of between $120 million and $140 million. As I turn to the guidance provided on slide 9, I'd like to remind everyone that the forward-looking disclaimer Peter presented at the start of the call applies to the guidance I'm about to provide. For the second quarter, we expect Billings in the range of $585 million to $605 million. Revenue in the range of $505 million to $515 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 22.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.51, which assumes a share count of between $177 million and $179 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. We are seeing healthy pipeline growth and we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow faster than the security market in 2019. For 2019, we expect Billings in the range of $2.470 billion to $2.520 billion. Revenue in the range of $2.070 billion to $2.100 billion. Total service revenue in the range of $1.340 billion to $1.360 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.15 which assumes a share count of between 178 million to 180 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24%. We expect cash taxes to be between $53 million and $59 million. Before I turn the call back over to Peter, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. We'd like to open the call for questions operator please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe I'll start with you Ken. Just around some of the strength you saw in the virtual portfolio that Ken alluded \u2013 sorry -- Keith alluded to in his remarks, I wanted to get your sense of the some of the advancement and enhancement you've made on the technical side that you talked about at the user event? And how you expect the virtual and FortiGate-VM business to be additive to the overall product growth trajectory? And then, I have a follow-up for Keith, if I may. Ken Xie : Yes. It's good question. In the \u2013 on the prior conference and \u2013 we represent \u2013 actually we either emphasize both on the virtual cloud and also on the edge side. We do see that the cloud has a pretty good outstanding growth in the last few years. But also we feel going forward edge also starting more weight there, so that's where we see \u2013 in hand, we need emphasize both and also the way we approach the cloud also we are more like horizontal approach, which have multi-cloud provider and also function including virtual data center within the enterprise and also the public cloud. So that's a place we see pretty good success and also the customer \u2013 enterprise customer love that approach, give them flexibility to move different function and different application between different call provider and also enables some different function both on-premise and also in the cloud in the virtual environment. So I think \u2013 that's kind of the approach we get a very positive feedback from our customer. Fatima Boolani : That makes sense. And Keith a question for you, I wanted to dig into the subscription revenue line item. That saw both acceleration year-over-year as well as off the fourth quarter. And so, can you step us through some of the dynamics working there, especially with regards to the type of uptake you're seeing between your UTM bundles and the enterprise bundle, and maybe give us a sense sort of how much runway is left for those bundles to really be more broadly adopted in the base, and then also having existing UTM customers' graduates enterprise bundles? That will be super helpful. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Okay. Sure. So I think in terms of the subscription revenue, if you look at the growth in the short-term component of that, we're very pleased to see that short-term growth. If you move back a few quarters, you kind of see that it may have hit a low-water mark in the middle of 2018, and again that's kind of coming off of a slower growth year in product revenue in 2017. I think what you really see there is a continuation of a lagging indicator when you look at the revenue growth, as opposed to the billings growth. To give some color in terms of what we're seeing on the billing side. Yes, we continue to see a shift from 8x5 to 24x7 support. That continues to move up incrementally. I believe that still has a significant way to run, I would say several more quarters easily. When I look at the FortiGate bundles, I think the UTM continues to outperform at a very, very high level. We're also seeing more customers coming back and buying from us on an ala carte basis on various security subscription and I think you're seeing some of that coming through on an additive approach as well. Other comments I would offer about that when I look at our renewal rates, whether that's for FortiCare and FortiGuard, they're very stable perhaps even ticking up a little bit. So I feel very good about what we're seeing there. When I look at the attach rates for the contracts to the appliances, I see very much the same there. That is to say very stable perhaps a slight uptick in terms of attach rates. Fatima Boolani : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ongoing consistent performance. Ken like -- likes a team, I want to go back to the recent Accelerate 19 event just a few weeks back. You talked about the move into third generation of cybersecurity or security driven networking. Can you talk to us on how the fabric strategy sits with your customers transitioning into this Third Generation of cybersecurity? And I have a follow-up. Ken Xie : Yeah. Thank you. It's a good question, because the reason, they're starting to have the infrastructure and the security, because the traditional across the border within the company that was disappearing now, because the data starting go to the cloud, to the edge, to the mobile outside. And even within the company also, there's so many different ways to access the all site. Also working in the internet or some other things there also bring your own device, bringing lot of sins inside of the company. So, that's where the security starting to move inside the company now, and also outside the company border there. So that's where the cause of like the fabric approach, the infrastructure approach is really different part of our infrastructure need to working together. And the network to the center of that, because multi-site also come on the network side. But you also have to working with different application and also different part of the cloud, and also like within the company also put an internal segmentation, the WiFi and also the SD-WAN goes over the branch. So that\u2019s the multiple part infrastructure working together is the key, that's what we called the integrated and automated approach. The key is really how to make all this kind of covered broad attack surface and also can automate response to all this attack, and so that's where the integrations and \u2013 key and without evolution you cannot go to the next stage of automation. But it's an innovation sometimes make it difficult across different product lines, across different vendor. So that's where the fabric is where we tie to all of these things together. So among fabric product, multi-strategy internally innovate and build is really want to make working together from day one. So that's will make an integration and automation much more effective more easily compare. But also, we have formed some other partner programs like with Symantec with the end point side. So that's where we kind of working together to make sure, we can cover more broad tech service and the secure the whole infrastructure. And so that's the fabric story behind. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Thank you for guiding. And also, at Accelerate you discussed Fortinet remaining highly focused on channel partners, maybe a two-part question here. Any change in contribution from your largest distributors over the course of the past few quarters? And what is it that Fortinet has been doing to support the distributors near- and longer-term? Thank you. Ken Xie : The thing you asked more in the partner the channel program, because we also realize the security, the service piece is very, very important, that's even the customer broader product make sure they can get the best service and a lot of service also goes through our partner. So that's where we want to have a more close relations with the partner and also have a win-win both profit together with the events of the space together. So that's where we see attendance of the accelerate, the partner customer conference up 37%. So it's a huge success. And we can see the partner, the customers that more open to us compared to some other competitor kind of setting limits some of the channel partner program. And maybe we see a very strong feedback partner to see the advantage of our product and also a better margin we starting share with them. Keith Jensen : This is Keith. I'll just kind of jump in and echo some of what Ken said. Look the partners are very, very important to us, it's a critical part of our business and it's a way in which that we have access to end users that oftentimes we would not have access to. If you look at the different types of partners that we have, you probably get a little bit different flavor in terms of how we're working together. At the distributor level, we're really providing them with incentives and trainings for what we call distributor-led business. At the SMB level, we're looking for targeting customers and again providing them whether its financial incentives or training programs that will help enable us to extend our reach further and further into the SMB. I think even that the VARs that are looking to provide MSSP-type services and some other companies that are trying to buy private cloud services, you see us making investments in there. But again overall as Ken alluded to the partner program remains very important to us. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Melissa Franchi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hamza Fodderwala : Hi. This is Hamza Fodderwala in for Melissa Franchi. I had a quick question just regarding revenue in the quarter. So I think Keith you mentioned about just the increasing deferred revenue giving more visibility into the forward outlook, but the revenue did come in below the high end of the guidance range and the product revenue growth slowed down quite a bit versus Q4. So I'm wondering, are you seeing any changes in the overall refresh environment or this more just like a seasonal slowdown in Q1? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I don't think that -- I'll kind of touch on a couple of points. The refresh cycle that's been talked about, you're not going to see that have the same impact on us that it would have been a large enterprise organization. If you go back and look at us in 2013, 2014, 2015 very strong MSSP, SMB business has probably a different renewal rate, different return rate, different ASPs. If you benchmark that against a traditional enterprise incumbent I think that's probably more of a discussion point for that particular group of companies. In terms of what you saw in the quarter relative to just -- I would say that's just normal seasonality for us. Q1 is an extremely renewal rich quarter meaning the sales team has to spend a lot of time and energy focusing on renewing customers that's just kind of a normal contract expiration date. And I think when you see that historically you've noted or we would note that you get a different bit of a mix shift in our billings between services/renewals and product. Hamza Fodderwala : Got it. And just a follow-up question, its more housekeeping. You mentioned service provider being 40% of top 25 deals. In terms of just total billings what was that mix? Keith Jensen : Service provider came in at about 19% of our total -- 18%, excuse me I stand corrected. 18% of total billings. Hamza Fodderwala : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Good. Thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to ask on the geographic split. Your growth in Europe has consistently outperformed the other regions and this quarter was no different. Is there any color you can provide regarding the wide disparity in growth rates in Europe versus the U.S.? Keith Jensen : I think historically the European team has just performed extremely well. It's a mature sales team that's worked together for many, many years. The partner program there is very, very stable and continue to work with the same orders over and over again. So we feel very, very good about what we're seeing there. I think if you compared the U.S. number that had a pretty tough compare I think year-over-year. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I do think that there is significant opportunity for us in the U.S. particularly as we push further and further towards the enterprise. Ken Xie : Yeah. Also the enterprise also need some time to ramp up and also we try to speed up enterprise and also harness the momentum ourselves, but the enterprise you have some like six to 12 months lag behind when they got you some results. Andrew Nowinski : Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up question as it relates to your billings, very strong performance in Q1 but it looked like the guidance for Q2 is maybe a little bit below consensus. Did any deals get pulled into Q1 that may have boosted Q1? Keith Jensen : No not really. And again if you look at our mix you don't see us talking about eight-figure deals, you'll see us talking about a seven-figure deals. So it would seem unlikely that I'd be pulling something in. I would say that overall I think Q1 came in very much like we expected it come in. It was very nice into the outperformance on the billings line for the quarter. And I would say at this point after a quarter underneath our belt, I think the year is looking very much likely expected it to look like. Andrew Nowinski : Okay, very good. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe for you Keith. Just to go back to the product and services split and just ask it in a little bit different way. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that midrange appliance in particular did well in the quarter. Can you just touch on whether that mix had any, sort of, impact on the year-on-year compare in product revenue? Keith Jensen : I saw the mid-range product family steal share if you will from both the low end and the high end product. And I think that what you're seeing there we talked previously about the success on the E-series product particularly the 500E. And I think with the introduction of the 400 and the 600 not saying the 400 and 600 had a significant impact in the quarter given their recent introduction, but I expect that the mid-range product is going to continue to do very, very well for us. I am not sure I'd offer much more than that on it. Saket Kalia : Got it. That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for you Ken maybe just a bit higher level. Obviously, a lot of success with this idea of security-driven networking and that SD-WAN capability built into FortiOS. And so the question is since you're consolidating appliances here for customers with SD-WAN and the firewall. How do you think about the monetization strategy for that down the road? It feels like right now it's a nice way to gain share in the network security market, but are there any other thoughts on kind of how the pricing packaging there for SD-WAN could potentially change in the future if at all? Ken Xie : I think just like 10 years ago when we're starting to have a WiFi built into the FortiGate. We did see like security networking most item kind of go together, and especially like a security is more like a top approach and because security like I said need like a 10 times to 100 times more computing power to process the same traffic compared to the networking. So it's more easy for the secured vendor to like offer some networking function because security parts can have a much bigger computing power and more room to offer additional function there. But on customer -- and also in the normal security side, no one like to have multiple pass there. It's more costly, a lot of latency and difficult to manage and that's where the more you can consolidate and function into a single path the better. So that's a feedback on customer and then in Q1 we're also starting to see the service part that didn\u2019t go up, so that's what compared to like a few years ago the service keeping increase and that's part of because some function like SD-WAN constantly want to buy additional service. And not just the traditional like 8x5, 24/7, but also we offer because the Fortinet 360 service that's helping customer to monitor that helps you of the network of the security deployment. So that's certainly is starting grow very quickly. And also Keith mentioned the 24/7 FortiGate products, so that also started to grow rather quickly compared to the 8x5. So all this kind of helping drive additional service additional margin for us. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Robert [indiscernible] on for Michael today. How are you doing at balancing your focus on improving in enterprise with maintaining your strength in SMB both in direct sales and in the channel? Ken Xie : I think, we starting from \u2013 because enterprise you need to have the whole structure behind from the marketing side to the sales coverage and the -- to the process supporting. And then also sometimes we also need some long-term investment. So we're starting to like starting to get all this infrastructure be ready at the same time and that we also get lot of enterprise sales people onboard and also the marketing supporting also starting to build out for -- to support in enterprise now. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think it's a very fair question. We've set out the framework that we're operating within in terms of what our profitability expectations in the coming years. And within that framework, we're investing I think successfully in both our channel, MSSP and SMB business is continuing to see what I believe to be very, very strong growth in that region. And then using the excess proceeds if you will from the success in that to fund the growth into the enterprise segment of the market. And then as Ken talked about there is many moving parts there. One thing that we track very closely is what we call account coverage ratios, which is how many accounts have signed to individual rep in the enterprise space. And I would say that this is a process that we're going through where we're looking to continually improve that ratio. Looking at those ratios and looking at the pipeline, we just continue to believe that it's a worth -- very worthwhile investment to continue to push into the enterprise. Unidentified Analyst : That's really helpful. And just as a follow-up question maybe just taking a step back here. Last quarter you expressed in caution around the macro environment, how are you feeling at this point? Keith Jensen : Yes. I was -- January was a little interesting around -- for various companies. I think January for us has impacted the quarter. Started off a little bit slower than we would have liked, but after that I think the quarter hit its stride. At the moment, I don't think we're concerned about government shutdowns or -- Brexit seems to have been deferred, we'll see what happens between China and the U.S. But as I commented earlier in the call at the end of the day, I think Q1 pretty shaped up like we expected it to with a little bit of outperformance on the Billings line and I think with Q1 underneath the belt, we feel good about the rest of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Ken I paid careful attention to your comments about the seven-figure EMEA-based power and water utility win that you had in particular using FortiGate and your SD-WAN product and management capabilities to provide visibility and integration into the customer's OT network. When we think about the OT opportunity, how big do you feel it really is? How you much are you investing to go after it? And do you need specialized product to win in this market? Ken Xie : Yes. That's OT -- IoT is a one of the driving engine -- growth engine for us. So, our estimate we can look in the copy for sure which is the public information in the website. By 2022 will be a $19 billion market for the IoT OT security. So, we are leading in that space and we do need a different product and also even different function compared to the traditional network security or some other like cloud or infrastructure security. And at the same time, it also need some investment early enough both on the engineer side in the go-to-market strategy and the sales coverage side also. But we are very happy to see the progress emerging there rather fast, it's one of the fast growing area for us right now and also lot of numbers. But the base is small, but growth is very, very fast and also huge potential going forward like probably in triple the size compared to some cost securities and other space. Brad Zelnick : Great, that's very helpful. And Keith just on CapEx appreciate the comments in 2019. Can you give us any sense of how we should think about at the investments going forward into next year? I know it's a bit early. Keith Jensen : Yes, that's a bit early. I think I would offer that -- we plan to occupy the building on -- in October of 2020. If we don't occupy the building on October 2020, Ken is going to have a very painful conversation with me. Brad Zelnick : Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Dan Bartus : This is Dan Bartus on for Tal. Thanks for taking the questions. I'd like to start with a higher-level one. So, you're doing really well with the network products clearly for a while now. So, I'm curious just what other areas do you think you could emerge as more of a leader? And I'm thinking about end point, email, network access control, et cetera. Wondering which adjacent or newer areas could you have provide the most upside surprise potentially in 2019. Ken Xie : I think some areas we prefer a partnership like the partner with Symantec because some space which already have the leader there and also has been there for a while. For that area we are more intent to do a partnership, that's why we have more than 57 because the Forti February fabric partner program and especially more close with Symantec for endpoint solution. In some other new area we also tried to manage both internal R&D innovation and also look in the space. Like last year we have at least two additions more on the technology product side acquisition not -- like I said the max side mostly for the internal security maybe internal security approach. So, that's where we look in the whole landscape is ready. Normal security is pretty interesting because you grow by keeping innovative and also integrate. It's not like endpoint or some other space, sometimes you may have a multiple vendor, multiple solution out there existing together. In the network security, most customer have a one box in line there to prevent a bad traffic. And then the more function you can integrate will be more helping the customer to really manage reduce the cost and latency and availability of this is. So, that's where we refuse innovation integration is part of a key for us and keeping growing the same time. Partner with some other part of infrastructure player it's also very, very important for us. And we still try to gain market share and also by partner together is also we found out that is, very, very effective way to win the situation. Dan Bartus : Great. That make sense. And then you're gaining share across the entire firewall market, but it looks like the share gains have also been mostly weight to the campus and branch office which makes sense with the SD-WAN trends. So, first just wondering if you agree that most of the share gains have been weighted to the segment of the market for you guys? And then second just curious who you view as your main coalition for that market because it's kind of a rare combination of firewall and SD-WAN that you guys are coming with? Thanks. Ken Xie : Actually, of course, in the Fortune 2000, it's much faster than the average and probably faster than how the branch office grows there. So, that's where we do keep gaining more share in the big enterprise also. And the SD-WAN is the one we feel we have more advantage compared to some other SD-WAN player or some other security player and also the market grow very, very fast. It's about 50% growth year-over-year and we are one of the leading provider. So we also starting -- we also have been doing this for last few years. So that's where we are more heavily promoting the SD-WAN, but also the investment into the enterprise and also some other fiber part, also we see very, very fast growth, above average. So I think the growth varies a lot by multiple fronts and we do see each of them also give us quite a good potential and advantage over our competitor going forward. Keith Jensen : Yes. Thanks Ken. I'll just add to what you said. I think if you look at the vertical loan offer that, I think, very pleased with what I'm seeing with financial services. We come out of a history of being very active and engaged in the trading areas of banks and such, and now seeing that allowing us to move into other segments within that -- within those institutions. And I would offer that when I look at the segment of the state, local, international, government, education, those are doing extremely well. There was an earlier comment about OT. I think if you started translating OT into verticals such as transportation, utilities, I think we're seeing some real success there as well. Dan Bartus : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Owens from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mike Casado : Hey, guys. This is Mike Casado on for Rob Owens. I wanted to circle back on the trends in North America. I know that it was a tough year-over-year comparison, but since our checks did pick up some weakness in North America, I'm hoping you can speak specifically to execution in the region, at least, as compared to your initial expectations? Ken Xie : The hiring of sale rep is little bit behind, which we will also speed up, add more resources behind to accelerate the hiring there. So that's have a little bit impact of North American growth, but as we have allotted product, the program and just somehow is the headcount little bit behind and that's also difficult to keeping full in the productivity and all the other things. So that's where -- because North America tend to be very competitive on hiring there, but we also said to add more resource behind to our salaried hiring there. Other than that, we don't see any big issue there. We you do believe the things will come back quickly. Mike Casado : That sounds okay. Ken Xie : Sorry? Mike Casado : I'm sorry. Go ahead. Keith Jensen : Ken, spot on with that. I think the first area of us in terms of -- we talked before that we'd like to see our sales hiring move roughly in tandem with our revenue, maybe just a little bit below that. We fell short of that, as you saw in my comment earlier in the presentation. And I think the key area of focus within that is really to do more things that help within the U.S. Now that said, I would offer, I think, the U.S. has done extremely well with the enterprise penetration. They continue to move in that direction and they're moving very quickly. That does tend to be a little bit lumpier, obviously, than the SMB and MSSP business. Mike Casado : That's helpful. And then relative to engagements that do involve OT or IoT, who are you seeing competitively? And what proportion of these engagements are truly greenfield? Ken Xie : I think we do see some smaller player, because a lot of our new company view is, it's a new market, a niche market, but for us, we also want to leverage our cumulative technology innovation from other part of network infrastructure security to get applied into the OT, IoT space. So also, kind of, working with some other, like, traditional equipment provider and some other service provider to offer better service in the space. And the space actually need a lot of different approach, whether that\u2019s segmentation or some kind of unrecognized environment, the solution is different, but also take some time to invest and also to have a solution to fit in that space. But we do see huge potential, like I mentioned, with the growing into management building in the next three years, there will be huge potential in the space. Mike Casado : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Two questions on the product side. One on the enterprise side, it feels like during 2018 you had talked more confidently about traction in the enterprise and it feels like you're here -- Ken, you mentioned you need to ramp up some hiring there. Has there been any attrition or anything that would explain the difference? And then, I had a follow-up on the product mix. Ken Xie : Just somehow the secured space is pretty hot in the last few quarter with all the competition on hiring. We also step up our effort there also, because the hiring time is kind of starting to hold us on the faster growth in the North America, which we said, add additional resource. But is -- if you -- it's really -- the hiring actually. For us, the growth also kind of -- we need more account coverage to grow faster in North America, but that's also comes from hiring, comes from the additional training program and that's where we can enhance now. Walter Pritchard : Okay. And then on the -- I guess, on the FortiGate, non-FortiGate. Can you help us understand either the mix within the product line of FortiGate and non-FortiGate? Or remind us what the attaches -- what's the relative difference of attach of subscription and annuity on FortiGate versus the non-FortiGate? Keith Jensen : So non-FortiGate will include software, will also -- software licenses and relative support is attached to it. There's also the product versions of the fabric products and software versions of those products. And then there's also secure access, which is switches and access points. The software obviously has the richest of the margins. Overall, what we're seeing from margins in those -- in that product suite, are very, very comparable with what we see throughout the rest of the company. And I think the -- I think that's it. Q \u2013 Walter Pritchard : And just Keith on the non-FortiGate, so I think it was 25% of total billings. Is it safe to say it was more than 25% of product? And any color there on how much in product the non-FortiGate made up? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : I don't have right with me ready color on that I'm kind of looking around. It wasn't something that stood out to me one way or the other. Q \u2013 Walter Pritchard : Okay. A \u2013 Keith Jensen : A little more I'm told. Q \u2013 Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Arete Research. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Patrick Colville : Thank you for taking my question. Can I ask about the billings? So the quarter billings Keith was really healthy. But you haven't really lifted the guide by much for the fiscal year. And 2Q is coming very much in line with expectations heading into the quarter. I mean can you just circle back to that one and give some color on why that is? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think we feel very good about how the year is shaping up. I do think that we basically took the over-performance in the first quarter and put it back on top of the guidance and raise the guidance for the full year. And I think coming off of Q1, that's probably a prudent approach to take to things. Certainly when we look at the pipeline, the sales coverage, the sales tenure, the key metrics that we're looking at the second half of the year absent meeting to hire some people faster that Ken has talked about. I think we feel very good about how the year is shaping up. Q \u2013 Patrick Colville : Great and can I ask Ken a question about firewall as a service? One of your competitors, whose first letter begins with a Z, is talking very constructively about firewall as a service and the opportunity in that market. What's your take? You've been in the industry for a long time and what's your take on firewall as a service? And how that could evolve and how Fortinet maybe could play into that in the future? A \u2013 Ken Xie : Yeah. I think for us now you can see two-third of the revenue come from the service. Service is a very, very important part of the offering. And so we do keeping invest more the service side. And also like additional function of SD-WAN, there's also driving a lot of additional service revenue for us. So that's where we -- and also when you go to enterprise service is also very, very important. Service and support into the enterprise customer and so that's where we keeping really the service part, Keith, other than that, any additional thing? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : No. Operator : Thank you. A \u2013 Ken Xie : Operator, next question please? Operator : We'll take our next question from Gray Powell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Gray Powell : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple if that's okay. So, I was just trying to make sure that we have a clean comparison on the product revenue side. Was ASC 606, a benefit a headwind or just neutral to product revenue in Q1? And then, how should we think about that dynamic for the remainder of the year? Thanks. A \u2013 Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the -- I think it's pretty much neutral to answer question. To give you color both obviously 2018, 2019 are on 606. So the numbers are comparable. If you go back and look at some of our disclosures from the prior periods, you probably saw things related to the software that was being recognized a little faster and some channel inventory in the U.S. but those components I believe are typically less than $5 million and that's kind of where we're at as we continue to move forward. Q \u2013 Gray Powell : Got it, thank you and just a quick follow-up, can you give any color on unit volumes in Q1? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : Unit volumes moved very much in tandem with product revenue growth. Q \u2013 Gray Powell : Got it, okay. Thank you very much. A \u2013 Keith Jensen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Taz Koujalgi from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Taz Koujalgi : Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. I'm not sure if I missed this on the call, but did you guys give their billings growth by different regions? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : No. We gave revenue growth in the back of the -- in the investor slide deck you'll see the revenue growth by regions. Q \u2013 Taz Koujalgi : Can we have it? I think you guys give that metric every quarter right? The billings by region? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : No. No we don't. Q \u2013 Taz Koujalgi : Okay. And then, one more housekeeping question well how was the enterprise growth in the quarter excluding the service provider vertical? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : The enterprise growth trailing 12 months is 23%, 24%, growth. Q \u2013 Taz Koujalgi : For this quarter, for Q1? A \u2013 Keith Jensen : Trailing 12 months number is what we give historically\u2026. Q \u2013 Taz Koujalgi : Okay. A \u2013 Keith Jensen : \u2026 and it was 23%, 24%. Q \u2013 Taz Koujalgi : Okay, great thank you. A \u2013 Keith Jensen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Ken Talanian : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could help us understand the market opportunity for your 360 protection bundle, how to think about that across customer segments and maybe how to think about the potential uplift to ACV as customers adopt that? A \u2013 Ken Xie : Yes. We're starting promoting our service about one year ago and we can see that there's huge potential, especially like some relate to customer need additional help to health check up there, deployment or the network function there, security function there. It's ramped up rather quickly, but that also need additional service supporting personnel to support in that. We also starting training quickly both on the Fortinet side and also some of our partner side also, but we do see this is one of the future strong growth area for us and also the service support has much better margin than the product side. We also see -- it's also can help in improving the overall margin for us. And while we're still in the early stage ramp up stage and also we need to acquire additional training support and effort and also promotion that is -- because so far the 8x5 24/7, so when customer has trouble they call us, call the supporting line, but this is more like a proactively do health check and helping customer to prevent anything happen ahead of time. So we're very, very positive feedback from other customers especially large enterprise customer we do see this is a can be keeping growing faster than other part of whether the service and support going forward. Ken Talanian : And just a quick follow-up to that, how should we think about your level of investment and the personnel necessary to support that this year versus what you did in 2018? Ken Xie : I think we are -- I think probably one thing we try to improving the productivity more than hiring kind of hiring trend behind the growth, but also we don't want to do behind too much, which eventually will limit the growth. So it's kind of -- we want to keep the build in the revenue growth a little bit ahead of hiring but not by too much. Keith Jensen : Yeah. This is Keith to go on Ken's comment. If there was a significant labor impact if you will from FortiCare 360 it will start appearing in the services gross margin line. Then obviously with the growth that we just reported we're not seeing that. Ken Talanian : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Breza from Northland Capital Market. Your line is open. Robert Breza : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. But my questions regarding hiring have been answered. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question come from Daniel Ives from Wedbush. Your line is open. Daniel Ives : Yes. Thanks. So I just have a question on large deal flow. I mean obviously, it continues to be tremendous. Is that a trend that you're expecting in the coming quarter just given the pipeline? Keith Jensen : Well I guess I would probably expend the metric that we gave on the prepared remarks. I think we talked about deals over $1 million I should also offer that deals over $500,000 grew at about 35% and that has been -- some quarters we give that number. Some quarters we don't. But it's very consistent area of growth for us and that $500,000 and above range. Daniel Ives : And do you think the success that you're having on large deals is more on the partner side direct competitively in terms of just what's driving some of these numbers that continue to defy the haters? Thanks. Ken Xie : So it come from our effort to drive enterprise growth, so that's where the lot of the direct cash. And also closely working with partners help both the partner is like -- and also the partner like in the we call the -- partner like the Symantec and all these are helping driving the big enterprise sales which is a much bigger deal compared to the other part. Daniel Ives : Great, job again. Keep it up. Thanks guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Peter Salkowski for any closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Crystal. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and let you know that Fortinet will be attending the following Investor conferences during the second quarter. We'll be at the Jeffries conference May 8 and 9 in Beverly Hills, the JPMorgan conference in Boston on May 14, the Baird conference in New York on June 4th, the William Blair conference in Chicago on June 5 and the Bank of America conference in San Francisco on June 6.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Crystal. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I\u2019m pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2019. Speakers on today\u2019s call are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high level perspective on our business, Keith will then review our financial and operating results and conclude by providing our guidance for the third quarter of 2019 and he will provide an update for the full year guidance before opening up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that on today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the day of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today\u2019s call are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s remarks, both which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone who joined to this call to discuss our second quarter 2019 results. We are pleased with our strong billings, revenue, operating margin and cash flow performance during the quarter. Our advanced technology, integrated security fabric architecture, broad cloud offerings and a secure SD-WAN all contributed to our solid market share gains in the quarter. Increased performance from our infrastructure security and cloud offerings drove total billings growth of 21%, well above the industry average. Non-FortiGate billings were 27% of total billings for the quarter. Revenue was up 18% to $522 million, driven by strong service revenue growth. Product revenue growth was consistent with the 14% increase we achieved in the first quarter despite a significantly more difficult earlier year comparison. Today, Fortinet announced three new high-performance next-generation firewalls, the FortiGate 1100E, FortiGate 2200E and FortiGate 3300E, which illustrate our superior technology advantage and enable organizations to securely accelerate their on-ramp to the cloud. Traditional network perimeters are dissolving as mobile cloud and IoT technologies changes the way people work as well as the volume of data they need to secure. Fortinet is a leader in hybrid cloud and edge security. During the quarter, we announced the addition of FortiWeb cloud WAF as a service to our cloud security portfolio offerings. This SaaS solution enables rapid application deployment. Additionally, Fortinet provides one of the broadest management as a service and security as a service offerings. These cloud offerings are easy to implement, easy to integrate, flexible and scalable. The explosion of IoT technologies is accelerating the movement of data and computing power to the edge. According to Gartner, 70% to 80% of edge data never gets to the data center to be processed. And within the next two years, 40% of large enterprises will integrate edge computing, up from 1% in 2017. The ability to offer security-driven networking at the edge with low latency and high performance is critical, especially with the deployment of 5G networks. Only Fortinet offers security and networking into a single, secured SD-WAN solution and our offering is clearly resonate with enterprise customers. During the quarter, the number of customers adopting Fortinet\u2019s secured SD-WAN solution more than doubled from the previous quarter. Going forward, we see 4 drivers of market share growth for Fortinet. First, our refreshed portfolio of FortiGates with integrated secure Wi-Fi, SD-WAN and 5G products are leading the transition to security-driven networking and continue to gain network security market share. Second, Fortinet\u2019s Security Fabric offers a broad, automated and integrated security solution for end-to-end protection as organizations consolidate towards a singular security vendors. Third, Fortinet provides a broad range of hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. And fourth, our OT and IoT security offering with Forti- ASIC SPU technology, continues to provide a cost and performance advantage versus our competition. I want to thank the Fortinet team and our partners for their ongoing hard work and our customers for their support. Now I will turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our second quarter performance and our guidance for the third quarter and full year. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Before I start, I\u2019d like to note that except for revenue, financial amounts are non-GAAP and growth rates are based on comparisons for the second quarter of 2018, unless otherwise stated. The slide references I make refer to the presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. One quick housekeeping note, we made one modification to the billings by product family slide by moving the FortiGate 100 series from the entry-level to the midrange product family. FortiGate appliances below the 100 series are desktop appliances. Midrange FortiGates, including the 100 series, are higher performing, rackmounted appliances. For your benefit, we have provided a product family billing trends and are both the old and new approaches. I\u2019d now like to summarize our strong second quarter performance. As Ken mentioned, total revenue of $522 million was up 18% led by service revenue growth of 21%. On a geographic basis, revenue growth was strong for both the Americas and APAC. Product revenue of $190 million was up 14%. Despite a significantly more difficult year-earlier comparison, product revenue growth was consistent with the first quarter of 2019. Product revenue benefited from the continued success of the E-Series and Fabric products. Service revenue grew 21% to $332 million, driven by a 24% increase in FortiGuard security subscriptions. Forticare technical support and other services increased 16% to $149 million. As shown in our second quarter results, service revenue continues to experience strong growth, improving margins and offers a high level of predictability. To illustrate these points, I would note, service revenue represents 64% of total revenue, up over 100 basis points. Services gross margin was 87.3%, up 50 basis points. Deferred revenue provided approximately 90% of service revenue and 60% of total revenue. In the third quarter, we expect similar percentages of service and total revenue to come from our existing deferred revenue balance. Total deferred revenue increased 27% to $1.9 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 21% to $1 billion. Now turning to billings. Total billings grew 21% to $622 million driven by strong growth from infrastructure fabric, cloud and the secure SD-WAN firewall use case. On a geographic basis, both the Americas and international emerging regions had strong quarters. Consistent with our prior comments regarding duration, average contract term increased 1 month year-over-year to approximately 27 months. Service providers, MSSPs remain one of our top customer segments, accounting for 15% of total billings. Increasing industry diversification, including strong growth from government and financial service verticals, led to a 21% increase in billings. Deals over $1 million increased 28% to 46. The total dollar value of these deals increased 37%. We are pleased with the geographic and customer diversity we are seeing in these large deals, with nearly 40% coming from EMEA and APAC. And consistent with prior quarters, our largest deal in the quarter was significantly less than 2% of total billings. Clearly, our business is not dependent on a handful of large deals in any given quarter. The number of deals over $250,000 increased 33% to 346. And the number of deals over $500,000 increased 30% to 147. Network security products and service billings increased 19% and accounted for 73% of total billings. New firewall use cases, including operational technology and secure SD-WAN, continue to provide a strong tailwind to FortiGate product and service billings growth. Secure SD-WAN was a leading contributor in the quarter and included 6 deals in excess of $1 million. Non-FortiGate products and service billings grew faster than network security billings driven by strong growth in infrastructure fabric, cloud and secure SD-WAN. Moving back to the income statement, gross margin improved 100 basis points to 76.4%. Product gross margin improved 110 basis points to 57.6%. Operating margin increased 250 basis points to 23.6%. Operating expense leverage and the gross margin improvement I just mentioned, easily offset a small decrease in the benefit from the change in commission accounting. Total headcount increased 15% to 6,293. Given our strong operating income performance, GAAP net income was $73 million. Moving to the statement on cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8, free cash flow was $178 million, up 36% year-over-year, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 34%, up 450 basis points year-over-year. The increase reflects strong second quarter billings and collections, continued inventory management and the flow-through of the increase in operating profit to net income. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $17 million. We expect third quarter capital expenditures of between $40 million and $50 million. Given lighter than anticipated construction spending for the first half of the year, our 2019 capital expenditure guidance moved slightly lower to between $110 million and $130 million. Our internal free cash flow models are in sync with the current street consensus estimate for the full year and reflect increased spending on a new campus building in the second half of the year. In the quarter, we repurchased 470,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of $35 million or an average per-share price of approximately $73.50. At the end of the second quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $643 million and is set to expire at the end of this year. As we turn to the guidance provided on Slide 9, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the forward-looking disclaimer Peter presented at the start of the call applies to the guidance I\u2019m about to provide. For the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $600 million to $615 million; revenue in the range of $525 million to $540 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 23.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.57, which assumes a share count of between 177 million at 179 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. For 2019, we expect billings in the range of $2,510,000,000 to $2,540,000,000. Revenue in the range of $2.100 billion to $2.120 billion. Total service revenue in the range of $1.340 billion to $1.360 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 23.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.23 to $2.26, which assumes a share count of between 177 million and 179 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 24%. We expect cash taxes to be between $52 million and $54 million. Before I turn the call back over to Peter, I\u2019d like to thank our partners, our customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter. Peter Salkowski : Thanks, Keith. Operator, we are ready for the Q&A session, please. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Congrats on the strong performance and the outlook, improved outlook. So Keith, Ken, clearly, from good acceleration on the SD-WAN front, you mentioned six deals in excess of $1 million. What\u2019s driving this healthy demand and acceleration you\u2019re seeing? Can you talk to us about some of the drivers on that front? And I have a follow-up. Ken Xie : This is Ken. Like I said previously that we believe the infrastructure and we call the security-driven networking side getting more and more important because the broader secured enterprise is appearing so now it is not over. Most are tech company internal. So that\u2019s where the SD-WAN is secure, all these WAN connection, branch office and together with the internal segmentation, security get more and more important. So that\u2019s why we see the SD-WAN is very good as a whole infrastructure security approach. So that\u2019s the reason we have for the last few years and starting building, we call, the security-driven network and infrastructure and as we see, very, very successful for this approach. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Got it. And I think we picked up some solid performance during the quarter within the federal arena. Can you provide us with your views on that vertical? How you view it down the road expanding second half this year and into 2020? Just initial thoughts. What specific products and services are you pushing within this vertical? KeithJensen: Shaul, this is Keith. I would probably just step back a tad bit and note that our government vertical includes not only the U.S. government but also international government agencies as well as state and local government agencies. So I think what we thought as growth in the quarter was actually more in the international front than it was domestically, so it will be a little difficult to respond specifically to the other products, if you will, on that particular segment you\u2019re speaking to. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi, guys. So much of this quarter, after the March quarter results, there was the healthy debate again about where we are with firewall refresh and what impact the shift to the cloud is going to add on firewall demand, et cetera. You mentioned the use cases but I wonder, Ken, if you could just kind of chime in and give us a sense what do you think the industry growth opportunity looks like for the core firewall and network security moving forward. Ken Xie : I think the industry is at \u2013 in a transition. The traditional refresh of the firewall, which you see like four, five, six years ago, using the major firewall UTM replace the traditional connection-based firewall UTM, is probably only part of the solution now. You need to have the whole infrastructure like the firewall connect with all these different kind of SD-WAN, the Wi-Fi, some end point and also the web and also the cloud. IoT need to be all kind of considered together. I feel that that\u2019s the new trend. And also, that\u2019s also easy to manage and consolidate all these connectivity solution, is starting to get more and more important because the management cost is going to get higher and higher for the security. So that\u2019s where we see the I\u2019ll probably call the weathered infrastructure security or security-driven networking already combined these together are starting to get more and more important. So that\u2019s where the traditional enterprise refresh is still going on. And I think compared to a few years ago, we have less market share compared to some of the competitors in the enterprise. So we are not being influenced very much about the refresh cycle. But we do see we have a more broad offering and most come from internal developed, which integrate and automate in Day 1, which has much better kind of easy to manage compared to some of our competitors come from acquired product. And the same time, the ASIC SPU give us huge performance advantage especially when you import it internally and in the very fast local area network and at the same time, when you have the infrastructure approach and also the other IoT, and so that\u2019s where the ASIC advantage that we call SPU, security process unit, are also starting to get bigger and bigger. At the same time, once we have a bigger market share, the cost per chip also starting to get lower. So the economy of scale are also starting to play so that\u2019s making our margin capability improving. Again, all these will help us to position going forward for the trend. I believe this kind of infrastructure security trend will keep you going in the next 10, 20 years and we are very well positioned for that change. Sterling Auty : Excellent. Maybe one quick follow-up. The Capital One breach, AWS back in the news, probably for the first big high-profile breach since maybe the PlayStation hack back a number of years. Do you think this will be the motivating factor to drive virtual firewall adoption in the cloud? Ken Xie : First, I feel \u2013 I don\u2019t see any impact on the Q2 number. As I said a second \u2013 more recently, at the same time, this definitely makes people more kind of consider security is more important. But on our side, if you put too much thing into a single cloud location, that also can be more risky. That\u2019s why from time to time, keeping things, you need to have sort of some balance among the cloud and edge and different application, different data, you need to have a different way and multiple layers to secure it. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on a very clean quarter. I\u2019ve got one for Ken and a follow-up for Keith. Ken, you talked about opportunities as network architecture and security moves to the edge. and I know this means different things to different people but if I look at the lower end, FortiGate appliance is ticking down a bit and seeing some other vendors out there with cloud proxies and customers doing local Internet breakouts at the branch office. How if at all, is this impacting your business? And how is Fortinet helping customers as they think about network transformations? Ken Xie : So I do believe the lower end was starting to pick up because we are in the middle of refreshing. So like last quarter, we announced the first product, FortiGate 100F using a new SoC4. I think going forward, there\u2019s a few other new product in the low end will come up using the leverage SoC4, which has performance, probably easily 3 to 5x better than the previous version. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re helping drive the low end growth. On the cloud side, I do see cloud is really is additional, is complement to what we offer from the infrastructure and also the edge computing. It\u2019s a part of the solution so we don\u2019t view as cloud will be reduced on premise and also in the edge. And also the edge, I feel, will probably even grow faster than the cloud in the next few years because from the deployment, some advantage of the edge compared to cloud you need to have both also solution and the cloud are already \u2013 and probably not using Gartner, they say that edge will beat the cloud. I do believe both will be existing but the edge, computing edge security need to be more emphasis address especially we have advantage using the ASIC chip and it\u2019s a large application because the real time, the latency requirement you have to process this in the edge. And in security, as Keith is saying, edge is good for the prevention, which you need to be real time process and the cloud will be good for management and certain storage, of which we may not have to deal with real-time and also could be for detection. But if you want to do the prevention and in line real-time protection, probably edge has more advantage. Keith Jensen : Brad, if I could just add to Ken\u2019s commentary just quickly. I wouldn\u2019t move aside the fact that you\u2019re looking at the mix shift, if you will, on our reporting between low, mid, and high with I think is actually happening there to a large extent. What you\u2019re seeing the success of the E-Series in the midrange product family in some ways causing mix shift. We\u2019ve talked about the 400 and 600 that we introduced earlier this year is coming online. But I\u2019ve also talked about the 500 E-Series for several quarters now. And just to extend that conversation one step further, I would note that when I compare the 500E to its predecessor, 500D, it\u2019s moving at about 300% or 400% faster than its predecessor did. So when I look at those sets of numbers, I think you\u2019re starting to see the success in the mid-range really kind of skew that mix for us. Brad Zelnick : That makes total sense, Keith. And just a quick follow-up, a housekeeping item that I might have missed in your prepared remarks. But did you tell us what the year-on-year FortiGate unit shipment growth was? I didn\u2019t catch that. Keith Jensen : I did not, but I can share that it moved in tandem with product revenue growth and that\u2019s also consistent with the first quarter of this year, moving in tandem with product revenue growth numbers. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the questions guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you and congrats on a nice quarter. So I wanted to ask about the million-dollar deals that you\u2019ve had and very strong growth. Just wondering if you could provide any more color on the drivers of that. And whether it was higher sales capacity or simply \u2013 or as simple as just having a broader portfolio of products now? Keith Jensen : I think \u2013 I\u2019m trying to make the effort \u2013 this is Keith, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m trying to make the effort to note one, the contribution from SD-WAN, which I think was six of the 46 deals that we saw there. We do see ourselves getting deeper into our enterprise installed base which is driving those larger deals and continued progress in the enterprise space. So I think as \u2013 if we map it out some several quarters ago in terms of what our expectations were, in terms of moving in that direction, I think you\u2019re seeing that reflected in those million-dollar deals. Ken Xie : Yes, also one other point I will add is really the multi product sales, what we call the fabric is also starting \u2013 doing better. So that\u2019s where we see the non-FortiGate starting grew faster than the FortiGate is making the total infrastructure solutions. That\u2019s also helping make the deal larger. Andrew Nowinski : Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up. As it relates to EMEA, it looked like your growth may have decelerated a little bit relative to last quarter. But that is consistent with a lot of other vendors and what they reported in EMEA. So just wondering, was that just due to the macro in EMEA? Or were there some other factors there? Ken Xie : Probably the comparison is a little bit tough and also the UK has maybe a little bit uncertainty so \u2013 and Keith? Keith Jensen : I think you\u2019re spot on to that, Ken. I do think it was a tough compare coming off of last year. Our EMEA number includes Europe, Continental Europe as well as what you call international emerging, which actually performed very, very well in the quarter. But going back to Europe, yes, I think what we\u2019re sensing there is consistent with the commentary that we\u2019ve read from other reports, if you will. As Ken noted, the U.K. seems to be in a bit of a doldrums, if you will, across industries and I think we saw that as well. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thanks. Keep up the good work guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open. Jonathan Ho : Hi. Good afternoon. I\u2019d like to echo my congratulations as well. I just wanted to maybe start out with a little bit of color in terms of your go to market and channel engagement and can you maybe give us a sense of what\u2019s been successful there and has this sort of helped some \u2013 drive some of the larger enterprise deals? Keith Jensen : We\u2019re kind of arguing about who\u2019s going to give the good news, I guess. I think we\u2019ve become \u2013 we\u2019ve matured. We\u2019re closer to our partners and we\u2019re better at getting their insights and feedback about what they\u2019re looking forward to be successful. I think we are maturing and becoming more operationally focused. You\u2019re seeing us make greater better use to protect our channel partners on things like deal registration and applying that very broadly. I think we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m very pleased with the performance of our channel leadership team as well as everybody on our channel team and how they\u2019re engaging with the channel. Ken Xie : And also, we have a better tool today compared to a few years ago to effectively measure the effect and the results, whether the pipeline or the sales productivity and how each program perform. So that\u2019s also helping to drive the better efficient growth. Jonathan Ho : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the SD-WAN questions that have been asked. I mean I\u2019m just trying to understand, when you look at sort of the SD-WAN opportunities that are out there, my understanding is that people can choose either a cloud solution or maybe a software defined solution or traditional appliance. What type of mix are you seeing out there as people start to make this shift in terms of their edge opportunities? Ken Xie : So for us, we put SD-WAN function inside the FortiGate product for the OS function there. So that\u2019s what keeps them integrated, single box solution, cover both on the security SD-WAN networking all this together and making it more easy to manage. And also, this also can tie to like a different application which need to be secured. So that cost more the like solution. And also because we have ASIC advantage built in the FortiGate, as all the ASIC, especially SoC4, the new one, which can have a much better cost performance compared to some other SD-WAN solution, which, if you\u2019re using a general-purpose CPU, whether it\u2019ll cost much higher, they don\u2019t have additional computing power to do the security. All they have is a multiple box solution. So that\u2019s the advantage, is pretty \u2013 is very, very huge. And once we keep investing in the marketing sales coverage in this space, we do believe we\u2019ll become a leader in this space. Keith Jensen : Jonathan, this is Keith. Kind of let me just to add to that a little bit for more context. Clearly, in terms of form factors for us is the FortiGate appliance that\u2019s dominating the SD-WAN market. And to add just a tad bit more on that, when you look at it, it\u2019s fairly evenly spread across low-end, midrange and high-end FortiGates. It also drags along with this a certain amount of fabric products but also brings with it about 70% on average of the BOM is a service part \u2013 service component of the mix. Ken Xie : Yes, the SD-WAN also helping increase the percentage of our service revenue and also match what we call the broader security-driven networking, what we call the infrastructure security better. So that\u2019s the \u2013 this is more like a total solution, also drive some other product sales. Jonathan Ho : Thank you and congrats on the strong quarter. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Hey, Keith, maybe just start with you. You mentioned the service provider business I think was about 15% of billings with the top verticals obviously supporting that. Very strong 2018. How are you thinking about that vertical here in 2019? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think the \u2013 not going to guide to vertical specifically, of course, but I think that with across the industry we\u2019re seeing with a very strong 2018, whether that was because of tax reform or what have you but the carrier infrastructure seem to go very, very well in 2018. When you look at 2019, there\u2019s probably really three components of that business. There\u2019s that infrastructure for the carrier, there\u2019s also the MSSP and there\u2019s also the selling with the carriers. And I think it\u2019s the first one that\u2019s been a little more challenged across industry is in the first half of this year. We probably couple that with a significant amount of digestion of last year\u2019s acquisitions, if you will, of products, but also the mergers and consolidations that are going on in the industry this year are probably causing them to give them a little bit of a pause. Saket Kalia : Got it. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Ken, maybe for you. A lot of success in core network security with SD-WAN. Maybe outside of the appliance business, I think some questions were asked earlier just about Capital One and public security. Can you just talk a little bit about the public cloud security business at Fortinet? And maybe specifically, where you feel the virtual firewall offering is versus competitors, versus where you\u2019d like to see it? Ken Xie : Yes, our approach for the cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, is a little bit different than competitor. We have a more broad \u2013 the broadest offering cover both from a cloud provider and also on the function. So like we have a nine or 10 different functions from the traditional FortiGate to the Web to the Mail to the SIM to all these different application. And also, they can easily move from cloud provider to cloud provider for the enterprise. So this approach give the flexibility for the enterprise customer to adopt different kind of cloud provider, different function based on their need and at the same time, so we have all these on premise and also honestly, if you want access to cloud, we also have our strong FortiGate with SSL encryption performance that\u2019s also helping both on the cloud side and also on the edge side. So that\u2019s how these are helping. We see the cloud growth that is definitely faster than the overall billing growth and we still feel that\u2019s the \u2013 cloud is a part of the whole infrastructure security, will continue keeping driving the growth but also which also can help in the on premise and the edge growth. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : Thank you very much and congratulations on the results, including, Keith, continued good free \u2013 operating cash flow growth. I wanted to ask two questions. The first, Ken, I want to direct towards you. And it is a competition question but along a different metric or different vertical. And what I mean by that is you talked about the cloud but I specifically want to ask you about your views on the competitive threats or opportunities from the offload engines, like Zscaler. Why or why not do you see this as a competitive threat to Fortinet? Or do you think you can actually, in some ways, participate in this market through either partnership or directly? Ken Xie : I think we are a little more on the partner side because some application can fit into Zscaler for the traffic to the cloud or to their whatever service data center. But some other application like you still need to have all these edge device, like SD-WAN, to keeping the traffic forward to the cloud. Basically, they also need to deal with the local traffic. And a lot also \u2013 a lot of security issue with infrastructure security internal segmentation, that\u2019s also cannot be addressed by this cloud approach. So it\u2019s really the mix infrastructure hybrid solution is much better than just everything go to the cloud. And also from time to time, just like some other service provider want to offer similar service, so we are all behind supporting this kind of solution and that we feel \u2013 we just play with all our advantages, which can give a much better, strong performance, computing power and also the infrastructure of the total fiber solution compared with this different vendor, they may offer some solution good for certain application or certain deploy scenario. So that\u2019s where we kind of each play \u2013 in terms of advantage, that\u2019s probably will be a better way to moving forward. Keith Bachman : Makes sense. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up question is just wanted to get your perspective on how you\u2019re thinking about non-FortiGate growth potential. And the benchmark could be above, at, or below the growth rate of the company. But how are you thinking about the opportunities associated with the non-FortiGate helping your portfolio moving forward? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Ken Xie : The total addressable market for non-FortiGate we call the infrastructure approach or Fabric approach is larger. The issue is that the enterprise is facing \u2013 the management cost is rather high, involved with different piece of infrastructure security not working together. So you need to find a way to consolidate and manage it together, which the Forti Fabric approach offered a solution. And the way we design the product working together, automate together from day one, which is different than some other company, you cannot position some other approach, which makes it more difficult to integrate or automate. So that\u2019s where we see the growth so far in the last few quarters are faster than overall building growth. And at the same time, since it\u2019s going forward, we also see this even bigger opportunity and probably keeping growth faster than the overall growth. Keith Jensen : This is Keith again. I would just throw in a quick note. I would offer that when you look in the non-FortiGate side or infrastructure fabric, just to share with you, the growth rate on both the product and the hardware form factor and the software form factor do indeed outpace what we noted in the call, FortiGate, but they\u2019re also very similar in terms of the growth rates, both the hardware and the software form factors. Keith Bachman : Right, right, okay. Thank you, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Dan Bartus : Thanks, guys. This is Dan Bartus on for Tal. I wanted to ask again about where we\u2019re at in this midrange refresh cycle you\u2019re seeing. What stage of maturity are we at for the 500E cycle? And then is it natural to think that the 400 and 600 products just continue that cycle? Ken Xie : Yes, the midrange refresh pretty much done, I have to say. And also, like Keith said, as the new E-Series has much better performance. And that the 400, 600 also enhance compared with 300, 500, it\u2019s relatively new compared to 300, 500. We do see the performance that the cost price ratio also is better. So that\u2019s pretty much there. And then the next phase move towards the lower end. So that\u2019s coming up. Dan Bartus : Okay, great. And then you\u2019re clearly doing well with SD-WAN in branch office or campus environments. And then you\u2019re also doing well with the MSSPs. So I\u2019m just curious, how is your growth in the more traditional private data center firewall market? And what do you think the growth outlook for this sub-segment is? Ken Xie : So that\u2019s the new \u2013 probably announcing today, the 1100E, the 2200E and 3300E. As you can see this product is really more powerful and best fit for the traditional network security like whether internal segmentation or the data center. So we have the best performance, best security function integrate together. I think this will help the future growth a lot. Dan Bartus : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is open. Katherine McCracken : Hi. This is Katherine McCracken on for Fatima. I wanted to go back to SD-WAN as a demand driver. One of the questions we has is given that we know FortiGates can be deployed for SD-WAN use cases, what extent are you seeing traditional FortiGates being implemented primarily for SD-WAN purposes? Keith Jensen : It certainly happens. Let\u2019s put it that way. We\u2019re not getting a lot of metrics there. Peter and I were at a customer meeting a few months ago and that was specifically what was happening. Ken Xie : Yes. That\u2019s also what happened to have traditional service supporting revenue. So if they \u2013 if we want to enable the SD-WAN function for the FortiGate they already have. So that also will help us. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s anywhere close to majority, that perhaps is an outlier. But it can be done. We see instances of it being done. Katherine McCracken : Okay, got it. And then as a follow-up, on the margin front, in the last couple of quarters, you mentioned being under indexed on salespeople and I was just wondering if sales hiring caught up in the quarter, and how we should be thinking about sales and marketing expense for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Ken Xie : The year improved, still not quite here, which you know, that will take time and also when they onboard us, we need time to enable ramp-up. So that, I\u2019d say, is some time when you invest in certain sales and marketing, probably the return take a little longer than you launch the new product. So that is on other side, we do see is still very important to keeping to invest in marketing ourselves. Keith Jensen : Yes, I would supplement Ken\u2019s comment, Katherine, by noting that, of course, it\u2019s baked into our guidance in terms of the hiring rate that we just provided, and I don\u2019t want to overlook what a very strong performance when I mentioned the America or the U.S. in particular came through in the second quarter. Very high productivity, very high returns, very high growth rates. So we\u2019re very pleased with their performance, including their success in the Global 2000. Ken Xie : Basically there\u2019s a two-part, one part is you need to add headcount. The other part is really trying enable to sell so it has a better close rates \u2013 closing rate. So that\u2019s where the training all this kind of like help didn\u2019t get it from here with product, multiple product solution also very, very important and we also \u2013 hence a lot of \u2013 in that area. Katherine McCracken : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open. Eric Heath : This is Eric Heath on for Michael. I just wanted to follow up on another question on service provider, and just ask a little bit more specifically how you\u2019re maybe incorporating 5G into your outlook for this year and going forward? Ken Xie : As you have heard in a few \u2013 at least a few quarter away, you will see anything impact by the 5G, or helping from the 5G. But we do have the product already there. It\u2019s also working with service provider to see what\u2019s the best way to secure the 5G network, and also a lot of other growth actually has come from the OT, IoT which also leverage the 5G. So that\u2019s where actually probably the 5G into a certain area like healthcare, like a certain industry, maybe grow the security probably ahead of some other more broad 5G approach for consumer in the carrier space. Eric Heath : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just separate, could you give us an update on your partnership with Symantec? How much do you go in market together? And kind of how has traction been so far? Ken Xie : I gave the market approach and progress there. And also that\u2019s one of the very important partnership we have, to go to market together. I think the view tells that engaged, working together and is helping both company. Eric Heath : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Melissa Franchi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hamza Fodderwala : This is Hamza Fodderwala in for Melissa. Thank you for taking my question. So just on the macro front, you touched on EMEA earlier. You also have about 1/4 of your revenue coming from APAC. Any concerns within that region? Obviously, the trade tensions we had, some of the new tariffs announcements earlier today and how that could sort of impact growth within the region more broadly? I also noticed you had a recent partnership announcement with Alibaba, so \u2013 yes, just any commentary on that would be helpful. Keith Jensen : Hamza, it\u2019s Keith. Answer in reverse order. Yes, we\u2019re very pleased with the announcement with the Alibaba announcement that you saw. China by itself has not been a large contributor to our business historically for the last several years. Regarding tariffs, we saw the announcement earlier today. We did some double-checking on that and made sure that we were still fine with our guide, and we\u2019re very fine. We do have some production that I mentioned before in Southern China but that the majority is outside of China. And then I guess a last comment I would offer is that for us, the Asia PAC area is, obviously \u2013 it\u2019s a very diverse geography, covering many countries all the way from Australia, New Zealand up through South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, et cetera. Hamza Fodderwala : Got it. And then just on the SD-WAN, your early momentum. The six deals that you mentioned above $1 million, were those bundled deals with the SD-WAN use case attached? Or were those deals primarily led with the SD-WAN value proposition? And that\u2019s it for me. Ken Xie : Yes, I think it\u2019s more led by the SD-WAN, even some of them are not even enable security function to begin with, but I do see the advantage of a security capability in a box whenever they need to turn it on. Hamza Fodderwala : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Dan Ives : Yes, Ken. Have sales cycles changed on the larger deals? I mean, are they starting to now shorten given it seems like it\u2019s a little more downhill scheme for you guys? I heard you signed some seven-figure deals. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think the enterprise by and large, a new enterprise logo, I think the sales cycle is what the sales cycle is. Ken would point out to me that typically, there\u2019s a fairly robust RFP process that goes out, short list, a proof of concept, testing, and so forth. So if you\u2019re chasing a new opportunity to saw that incumbent, I don\u2019t really see a change there. To the extent that you\u2019re just talking about an expansion of an existing enterprise logo, yes, I do think you\u2019re going to see things like some SD-WAN opportunities that move faster than perhaps other things and certainly in general, an expansion into an existing account moves faster than in the local. Dan Ives : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Arete Research. Your line is now open. Patrick Colville : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a pretty awesome quarter. Can I just ask about the SD-WAN and secure switching fees? There\u2019s been a seriously impressive part of your business for the last couple of quarters. And I just wonder kind of in the medium-term, what do you see is your competitive advantage given that business line versus your competitors? Why will Fortinet sustain its healthy momentum? Ken Xie : Yes, I see \u2013 like I said, its inventory transition from the traditional, like, network security only to more infrastructure, also we call the security-driven networking. That\u2019s where \u2013 because the border disappears. So if you have a secured Internet connection and the enterprise is no longer enough, you need to go internal, address the segmentation in a different data server, all these kind of you see \u2013 also need to make sure the connection to the outside or to the mobile also be secure, whether the Wi-Fi or the SD-WAN. So that\u2019s what we have this approach with our technology from the SP ASIC shift to the function tower SD-WAN, Wi-Fi going forward to 5G, so all kind of working together. At the same time, the fabric is also helping making that total solution. Multiple layer total solution works better now. So that\u2019s what we see, and we see the transition for the industry is more like an infrastructure consolidate fabric approach, help us drive this transition going forward compared to some our competitors who \u2013 whether more in the traditional network security gateway or kind of only address some part of infrastructure of a certain application hub. So we feel we have a much better, broader and kind of more advanced approach, not only for this SD-WAN but also going forward with the 5G, the IoT office security, and we see is a huge potential going forward. Patrick Colville : Great. Just a quick follow-up. There have been some other earnings I\u2019ve met up, this evening for example, missed quite badly and some of the kind of on-prem vendors have had some bad results. Why is it that the firewall market has remained so healthy? You guys have put out great numbers and the guidance implies that meant it stays really strong. Why is it the firewall market and security market has been so different to other on-prem spending areas? Keith Jensen : Patrick, this is Keith. I think that you\u2019ve got to keep in mind the significant diversification that we have, whether that\u2019s across geographies or that\u2019s across the fabric products, in the firewalls or it must be the identification and taking advantage of new use cases such as SD-WAN, OT and such. Perhaps if it was four or five years ago, you can have a conversation with us about being a point solution with firewalls but this has become a very diversified company. Patrick Colville : Thank you for answer for questions. Keep your good work, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gray Powell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Gray Powell : Great. Thanks for working me in. So I wanted to follow up on the Symantec relationship. At least in the conference circuit, it seems like they\u2019re talking up the partnership with Fortinet more and the potential to put Fortinet virtual firewalls into their cloud secured at gateway and how that can help them close the gap against Zscaler. Is that something that you built into your guidance? And is that \u2013 is there any material uplift that we should be thinking about from that relationship? Keith Jensen : We have had some billings from the Symantec relationship but I would not \u2013 I\u2019m comfortable with my guidance and I\u2019m not calling out Symantec separately or any particular upside to that relationship at this point. I think you\u2019ve described the use case, if you will, or how the \u2013 what the go to market cadence is for Symantec and why it makes sense as a business strategy. Gray Powell : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ken Talanian : Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned seeing an increase in the percentages of support and services, I think as a result of the SD-WAN. Are you seeing a broad uptick in support and services in part from a mix shift to richer firewall configurations? And can you help us understand maybe a bit about that magnitude of that? Keith Jensen : Yes. I \u2013 this is Keith, I\u2019m sorry, Ken. The \u2013 I was just trying to describe for people what an SD-WAN solution looks like when I mentioned that it\u2019s going to run about 70% services when I look at my other deals in the quarter. I wasn\u2019t trying to go someplace else with that particular comment. I can probably talk a little bit about some of the dynamics that are happening in FortiGuard, FortiCare. FortiGuard is doing very, very well. It probably has a number of advantages right now. It\u2019s coming off \u2013 it probably is coming off of a fairly high unit shipment number in 2018, product revenue with attached service contracts to that. You\u2019re seeing those services now roll into the income statement that was previously \u2013 that were previously deferred. So now you\u2019re seeing them happen there. You\u2019re also seeing, what I talked about before, the mix shift a little bit from low end to mid-range. In fact, it\u2019s been happening for a period of time now. To the extent I\u2019m selling more mid-range than I am low end that would typically attach a higher ASP on the service contracts giving a little bit more lift on the bundle, a little bit more lift from some standalone security offerings, things of that nature. Ken Talanian : Got it. And you described last quarter as rich in renewals. Could you comment on this quarter, and just how you\u2019re thinking about the remainder of the year? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think it\u2019s not surprising that for a tech company, Q1 tends to be the logical time to get a lot of renewals. If it\u2019s not in Q1, you get Q4. Q2, Q3, you may get some government entities. You\u2019re always going to have renewals throughout the year. But I think over time, you start to see a bit of a migration in terms of those renewals because of co-term agreements in the enterprise, et cetera, migrate towards the Q4-Q1 time frame and that\u2019s pretty much what we expected and that\u2019s what we saw. Ken Talanian : Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Taz Koujalgi from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Taz Koujalgi : Thanks for taking my question. I had a question about the fabric business. Is there a way to maybe look at the \u2013 like fill out the attachment? Like how many of your customers are using the fabric products today in the installed base, how much \u2013 so how much penetration do you have for those products in the installed base? And how that\u2019s trended in the last quarter? Keith Jensen : Yes. Not something that we talk about publicly, Taz, in terms of attach rates. I will tell you that it continues to steadily trend up. Taz Koujalgi : Got it. And then a question on billings guide. You had a strong billings number this quarter. Your guidance is really conservative. What are you assuming for duration for next quarter? Anything that\u2019s changing that\u2019s making you guide pretty fairly conservatively for next quarter? Keith Jensen : No, I think the nature of our business is that Q2 to Q3 typically is within one or two points of each other. I think we\u2019re at that rate. A very good Q2, obviously, so you\u2019re probably seeing a little bit of that factor into it. On the full year, when you do the math, you\u2019ll see that we put some of the upside from Q2 into the full year guidance. So yes, I think we feel very good about what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the quality of our pipeline, et cetera. Taz Koujalgi : Got it. And just one last one for me, you said that non-FortiGate obviously grew faster than FortiGate. Any more color on the cloud piece of the non-FortiGate? I know you used to give us some metrics in the past but any more color on how the cloud piece of non-FortiGate did this quarter? Keith Jensen : The fastest growing element of the non \u2013 of the fabric. Taz Koujalgi : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you, guys. Operator : And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to Peter Salkowski for any closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Crystal. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today, and let everybody know that Fortinet will be attending the following Investor Conferences during the third quarter. Oppenheimer on August 7 in Boston; we have the Raymond James Conference on August 21 in Chicago; the Dorothy Conference in Minneapolis on September 5. And we look forward to seeing many of you over the next several weeks. If you have any questions, please give me a call or send me an e-mail. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon, and Happy Halloween, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Speakers on today\u2019s call are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today, providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results, providing our guidance for the fourth quarter and update our 2019 guidance before opening the call to your questions. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please keep your questions brief and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to allow others to participate. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that on today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today\u2019s call are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today\u2019s remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our third quarter 2019 results. We are pleased with our strong billings product and service revenue, operating margin and free cash flow performance in the third quarter. Contributing to our strong third quarter result were our advanced Forti SPU-driven FortiGate technology, integrated security fabric solutions, hybrid and multi-cloud offerings and a significant adoption of our secure SD-WAN solution. Total revenue was up 21% to $548 million, and product revenue accelerated to 20% growth. During the third quarter, Fortinet was named a leader for the third consecutive year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Network Firewall. This recognition validates our advantage enabling enterprise customers to create a security-driven network, that delivers integrated and automated security to all network environments. Today, Fortinet announced the release of the new FortiGate 60F, the most popular and best-selling desktop next-generation firewall in the industry. The 60F leverages Fortinet\u2019s SoC4 SPU that enables secure SD-WAN. It delivers Security Compute Rating for threat protection, SSL inspection and next-generation firewall performance of 4 to 47 times faster than industry average appliance. The Security Compute Rating compares the performance of our Forti-SPU enhanced appliance with industry average solutions in the same price range utilizing generic CPUs for networking and security capabilities. 80% of WAN age solutions need security and IDC estimates that WAN edge total addressable market will increase from 1.3 billion in 2018 to 5.2 billion by 2023. Our secure SD-WAN solution clearly outperformed in the quarter. According to Gartner, in the second quarter of 2019, Fortinet ranked the third with faster growth and 11% of SD-WAN market share. This fast market share growth validates that our FortiGate solution with secure SD-WAN is clearly resonate with enterprise customers. Traditional network security border are dissolving as mobile, cloud and IoT technologies change the way people work and the volume of data they needs to secure. Edge computing require high-performance secure networking capabilities and 5G rollouts are in the early stages of providing mobility innovation and with demand low latency security solution. As a leader in hybrid and multi-cloud as well as edge security, Fortinet\u2019s ability to offer security driven networking and both edge and cloud security with low latency and high performance is a clear competitor advantage. Going forward, we see four drivers for market share growth for Fortinet. First, our refreshing portfolio of FortiGate with new Forti-SPU has a huge Security Compute Rating advantage compared with all other competitors. These FortiGates will continue to in lead the transition to security-driven networking and secure SD-WAN adoption that will allow Fortinet to gain additional market share. Second, Fortinet\u2019s Security Fabric allow us to offer a broad, automated and integrated secure solution for end-to-end protection as customers consolidate towards fewer security vendors. Third, Fortinet\u2019s broad range of hybrid and multi-cloud solutions enable us to provide security to the cloud and from the cloud. And fourth, Fortinet is well positioned to lead the transition to 5G and IoT security as a result of our Forti-SPU technology, which provides a huge advantage for embedded and integrated security with much lower cost and faster performance. On Monday, we announced acquisition of an endpoint security company, enSilo. The acquisition enhances Fortinet\u2019s security fabric offering and strengthen our real-time automated detection and response capability around endpoint and edge data. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome enSilo team to Fortinet. On November 18, we will celebrate Fortinet\u2019s 10-year anniversary as a public-traded company. I want to thank the Fortinet team and our partner for their ongoing hard work and our customers for their support. You have all contributed to our great success. Now I will turn the call over to Keith for a closer look on our third quarter performance and our guidance for the fourth quarter and then full year. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Let me first note that except for revenue, financial amounts are non-GAAP and growth rates are based on comparisons to the third quarter of 2018, unless otherwise stated. The slide references I make refer to the presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. I\u2019d now like to provide a summary of our strong third quarter performance. As part of the summary, I will highlight how the diversification in our business by geography, customer and industry segments and solutions has contributed to solid growth and consistent execution. Let\u2019s start with revenue. Total revenue of $548 million was up 21%, led by strong revenue growth from our fabric and cloud segments. Revenue from our largest segment, Network Security, was up 19%. Product revenue growth was 20%. 20% growth represents, first, an acceleration of the 14% growth we achieved in the first half of the year. Second, growth off increasingly more difficult year earlier comparisons as growth accelerated through 2018. And third, a growth rate that we estimate is double the industry growth rate. Product revenue of $197 million benefited from the segment growth noted a moment ago as well as growth in both appliance and software solutions. Given the significance of our historical SMB business and the consistent trend in our renewals, we believe the impact on our business of an industry refresh cycle is muted. Consistent with Ken\u2019s earlier comments related to our SD-WAN market share, growth benefited from the market\u2019s rapid adoption of our Fortigate-based secure SD-WAN offering. Our higher-margin service revenue increased 21% to $351 million and represented 64% of total revenue, up 10 points in four years. FortiGuard\u2019s subscription security revenues increased 23% to $193 million, while FortiCare technical support and other services revenue increased 19% to $158 million. Renewal rates remained very consistent with prior periods. Deferred revenue at the beginning of the third quarter accounted for over 90% of services revenue and 60% of total revenue recognized in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect the deferred revenue balance to provide a similar level of predictability, accounting for similar percentages of service and total revenue. Total deferred revenue increased 26% to just shy of $2 billion. Short term deferred revenue increased 21% to $1.1 billion. On a geographic basis, revenue growth for the Americas accelerated to 24% despite a more difficult year earlier comparison. EMEA growth accelerated to 21%. Now turning to billings. Total billings of $627 million were up 19% and benefited from the diversification of our business across geographies, customer and industry segments and solutions. Network security billings, which includes products and services, increased 16% and accounted for 74% of total billings. Billings growth for non-network security, which includes both products and services, outpaced network security billings. We generated billings in over 80 countries where their individual billings were less than 3% of our total billings. In aggregate, these 80 countries represented nearly 50% of total billings. While we saw somewhat slower growth in the UK and Germany, it was clearly offset by strong growth in several other EMEA countries. While service providers and MSSPs remain one of our top segments accounting for 17% of total billings, we experienced an equivalent contribution from the government segment and a strong contribution from the financial services segment. Looking now at deal sizes. Deals over $1 million increased 77% to 53 deals. Secure SD-WAN was a leading contributor to the increase in the number of deals in excess of $1 million, accounting for 8 deals in the third quarter, up from 1 deal of over $1 million last year. We are pleased to see the geographic diversity in all of our large deals with over 40% of them coming from EMEA and APAC. The number of deals over $250,000 and $500,000 each increased 26% to 333 and 130 deals, respectively. Average contract term of 26 months was flat year-over-year and down one month quarter-over-quarter. And to offer one final note on diversification, since Q1 of 2017, we have not had a single transaction in the quarter that represented more than 2% of quarterly billings. Now back to the income statement. Gross margin improved 170 basis points to 78.2%. Product gross margin improved 330 basis points to 60.7%. Product gross margin benefited from an attractive discounting environment, deal mix, software revenue growth and a stable product transition environment. Now while we\u2019re very pleased with the product gross margin performance in the third quarter, we expect it to return to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter. Services gross margin increased 70 basis points to 88%. Operating margin increased 250 basis points to 26.4%, driven by the improvement in gross margin and operating expense leverage associated with our strong revenue performance. Total headcount increased 17% to 6,590. Given the strong operating income performance, GAAP net income was $80 million, up $21 million or 36%. Moving to the statement and cash flow, summarized on Slides 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $204 million, up 29%, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 37%, up 230 basis points. The increase reflects strong third quarter billings, collections and the flow-through of the increase in operating profit to net income. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $17 million below expectations, due to the timing of construction spending. We expect fourth quarter capital expenditures to be $40 million to $50 million, resulting in a full year capital expenditures of between $90 million and $100 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 335,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of over $26 million at an average per share price of $78.70. At the end of the third quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $616 million. As I turn to guidance provided on Slide 9, I\u2019d like to remind everyone of our diversification on our model, again, by geographies, customer and industry segments and solutions, continuing to provide and contribute to our growth and the consistency in our financial performance. We will dive deeper into this consistency and visibility and predictability of our financial model at our Investor Day on November 18. With that, I\u2019d like to remind everyone of the forward-looking disclaimer Peter presented at the start of the call as it applies to all forward-looking statements, including the guidance I\u2019m about to provide. In the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $750 million to $765 million. Revenue in the range of $595 million to $610 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 to $0.71, which assumes a share count of between 176 million and 178 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. For 2019, we expect billings in the range of $2,550,000,000 to $2,565,000,000; revenue in the range of $2,135,000,000 to $2,150,000,000; total service revenue in the range of $1,355,000,000 to $1,365,000,000; non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% and 24.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39 to $2.41, which assumes a share count of between 175 million and 177 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24%. We expect cash taxes of between $56 million and $58 million. Like Ken, I\u2019d like to extend a warm welcome to the enSilo team. Before I turn the call back over to Peter, I\u2019d like to thank our partners, our customers, the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work. It\u2019s because of your dedication and efforts that Fortinet is able to celebrate 10 years as a publicly traded company on November 18. Ken, back then, you closed the day with a market cap of $1 billion. Today, your market cap is over $14 billion. Nicely done. Peter, back to you. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Operator, we\u2019re ready to open it up for Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Keith, I\u2019ll start with you. You\u2019ve had a fairly feverish pace of gateway and new FortiGate releases over the course of this year. You\u2019re talking about Forti SPU refreshing through the base. So I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on general ASP trends, how you\u2019re managing around cannibalization of ASPs given the extent and spectrum of the appliances you have? And any color you can sort of provide us on product shipment trends? And I do have a follow-up as well. Keith Jensen : Fatima, it\u2019s nice to hear from you. Kind of a number of topics in there. I\u2019ll try and recall each and every one of them. I think \u2013 look, I think, if you look at our product suite of FortiGates, we have about 75 different FortiGates, firewalls, that probably compares with some other people that maybe are closer to 15. Why that\u2019s important? You assign some sort of life cycle to those products and you pretty quickly come up with the idea that we\u2019re refreshing our products at the pace of probably eight, 10 or 12 a year. I think we\u2019ve become fairly good at it, and I don\u2019t \u2013 and I think part of that being good at it means both in terms of how we manage our inventory, but also how we manage that transition with our customers. I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on ASPs, other than to say that I was very pleased with the trend up of ASPs in the quarter, and it\u2019s been a very consistent upward margin ASPs overall. I would attribute some of that to the fabric products, which are driving, when I talk about ASPs, total billings for a solution, if you will. And I think that\u2019s contributing to our ASPs. And I probably missed something else. Fatima Boolani : That\u2019s very helpful. Just shifting gears to the secure SD-WAN traction. The 8 deals that you called out that were in excess of $1 million in the quarter, I wanted to peel back the onion on that to get a better sense of who the buying audience is here? And if you can speak to the competitive dynamics because relative to the one deal you did last year, I think that\u2019s a pretty significant improvement. So just wanted to peel back on some of the dynamics of the strength there. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Maybe I\u2019ll let Ken talk about the competitive dynamics, and I can talk just a little bit about who the buyers are first. Clearly, the SD-WAN market is tilted more towards the enterprise and less towards the SMB, and we see that in our customer mix shift in the SD-WAN. But Ken? Ken Xie : Yes. Also because, like I said, 80% enterprise customer in SD-WAN with security solution. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re the only one can integrate security and SD-WAN together in a single box. So that\u2019s a huge advantage. And also the computing power, we call it Secure Computing Rating, which gave us huge computing capability, so we can easily add additional function, whether on security side or the network side, just like even with SD-WAN alone, the performance is much better than any other competitor. And for them, [indiscernible] computing power can really add any other function, whether networking, security, that was kind of a huge advantage going forward. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Thanks, Hi, guys. So at this point, can you give us a sense of just how big is SD-WAN as a percentage of your business? Keith Jensen : I\u2019d probably point to Gartner had a report out, I think, in the second quarter that noted that our market share was 11% of SD-WAN. And I think our market share a year ago was 0 according to their report. I think there\u2019s some information there that you could look at. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then, Ken, with some of these terms, SD-WAN, and then secured Internet access, so the Zscalers, what Palo Alto is doing, maybe can you just take a minute and help frame for investors that are asking, they\u2019re asking me, to better understand what is SD-WAN actually giving to your customers versus what is kind of the secure Internet access that\u2019s replacing MPLS, et cetera? How do they differ? And what\u2019s your opportunity in both sides of the coin? Ken Xie : It\u2019s kind of a little bit different market position. Secure SD-WAN relate to the WAN-age transition. That\u2019s probably provide much like a software-defined, most smart and reliable way, low-cost way to access the enterprise, access the cloud. So that\u2019s where driving SD-WAN adoption. They grow almost 50% year-over-year in the next few years. And then I think whether Zscaler or Palo Alto [indiscernible] secure access, more about access some of their cloud or some other part, which if you look and by Gartner data, so by 2023, so security and security \u2013 could security is about a $4 billion market. And network security, including secure SD-WAN is about $28 billion market. So it\u2019s 7 times larger. So that\u2019s where network security is still the big \u2013 a much bigger part compared to overall infrastructure security. So that\u2019s where we are the only one, we offer both on the cloud side and we do have a similar solution, but we more prefer working with service provider for some kind of a secure access, all kind of Zscaler type of solution and we\u2019ll treat them as a partner. On the other side, we do believe, whether we call a secure driven networking or some other change, which make them integrate network and security altogether, like SD-WAN, like the Wi-Fi, like the 5G. So this is a much better solution and also enable our kind of technology advantage from the \u2013 because of security process unit compared to the other secured solution more used in the general purpose CPU, which has a very limited security computing power to process both the security function and network function. So it\u2019s a little bit two different approach, and we do believe our approach address much bigger market and also with a fast growth, fast transition and we\u2019re positioned quite well compared to any other competitors. Sterling Auty : Thank you. I appreciate that. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you very much. Keith, I wanted to target this to you. Your cash flow performance continues to be quite impressive in outpacing revenue growth. And I just wanted to ask you about how we should be thinking about this over the next year. Now part of it is your operating margins in the last year have gone up by over 700 basis points. And so I was just hoping to distill it down to, A, the operating margin metrics, but \u2013 and B, the working capital cycle, how you see that changing and just alleviate concerns you might have about me asking questions, we\u2019ll neutralize this for real estate. So I was just thinking about the underlying. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Keith. When you look at free cash flow, yes, real estate does come into play, and we expect a fair amount of spending on real estate next year. I think at the Analyst Day on November 18, I think the internal conversation here is whether or not we want to preview not free cash flow, but at least the real estate spending for 2020, excuse me, I maybe misspoke a moment ago. Look, I think that you\u2019ve kind of just nailed it in terms of we\u2019re executing fairly well on the working \u2013 on the capital model. Contract terms are holding fairly firm for us. How we pay our customer \u2013 or pay our vendors is holding fairly firm for us. So then it\u2019s really just a matter of continuing to manage our inventory, continue to grow your billings and then watching the margin drop through to that cash flow number. Keith Bachman : So is there any reason, just to clarify, I mean, it sounds like cash flow could continue to outpace revenue growth. Is that a fair conclusion? Keith Jensen : I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I\u2019m going to just pause on getting closer to guiding on free cash flow, if I can. Keith Bachman : Okay, okay. All right. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Thanks, Keith. Operator : Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Keith \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Ken, just maybe to start with you. Obviously, a lot of traction in SD-WAN. I want to ask a hypothetical question. If you put yourself in the shoes of your network security competitors, what don\u2019t they have that will either slow or prevent their ability to offer bundled SD-WAN and firewalling? And I guess where I\u2019m going with that question is, is it the custom-built ASIC processing power that we have here? Or is it a secret sauce inside the FortiOS? Maybe just to put up on that, the question is, what do you feel like the barrier to entry is with FortiGate and SD-WAN together? Ken Xie : You can look at today\u2019s press release, we announced the FortiGate 60F and also introduced the concept we call Security Computing Rating. I mean you can see we have a secure computing power capability probably like from 4x in some of the \u2013 like threat prevention, to like 47x for some networking session, concurrent session, or SSLs and other part. So that\u2019s where we have so much computing power in this what we call SPU, security process unit. They do have like a generic CPU embedded inside SPU, which can perform any, whatever new function we needed. But we also kind of making a lot of secure computing function when they built into that chip. That\u2019s where, by industry standard, they have a seven-year advantage easily like close to 100x faster and about the same cost. So that outside advantage we have is really the computing power in a security function, the network function, thus enable us to easily add like SD-WAN function, the WiFi function, the 5G function and also most security function compared to our competitor. They can only leverage the commercial available CPU, which we also leverage that, but we do use an ASIC to enhance that and also build \u2013 it is together. So that I feel the competitor has some difficult time to catch. And building a chip need a multiple year effort. At the same time, in today, we have almost 30% of our total global unit shipment in home network security. So that\u2019s also the economy of scale also that\u2019s in play. So I feel we can feel this. We can count more than half of the total unit shipment in the home network security space. So that also will be making any competitor have some difficult time if they don\u2019t have the economy of scale to catch up because building chip, you also need a big investment in the beginning. And then once you have the quantity, the average cost can get lower. So we have this investment almost 20 years ago when company started. So that\u2019s where all almost 20-year effort investments that enable us to easily add additional funds, whether in the networking or in the security. Because what we see like in my script is ready, that the border \u2013 the security border disappear. So at this time, the enterprise refreshing is different \u2013 totally different than like what happened in six, seven years ago. Now on the next-generation firewall is intrusion prevention as a mother, replaced the first generation connection base of firewall. So this time, the border is no longer there. So you needed this internal segmentation. You need to kind of secure the server, the department of data and also, you need to secure the one connection. So that drive us to make sure we call the security driven network and also the fabric approach to secure the whole infrastructure. So we have this kind of an investment prepared in the last like 5 \u2013 10, 20 years. And we feel we are much better positioned than the competitor, whether they try to do an acquisition, which will be more difficult to integrate. And also without kind of a dedicated ASIC chip, so they don\u2019t have computing power to add additional function there. So that\u2019s the advantage we have from all this long-term investment, also the planning we have. Saket Kalia : That makes a ton of sense, Ken. Just maybe for a quick follow-up for you, Keith. Keith, I think you talked about strong renewal rates with FortiGuard and FortiCare. Just to make sure it\u2019s asked, can you just talk about attach rates for FortiGuard and FortiCare and whether there were any changes in trends on particular SKUs that you saw in terms of 24/7 support or lower or whatever, just in terms of different trends for FortiGuard or FortiCare? Keith Jensen : Yes. No, I think that\u2019s a good question. The renewal rates not only in total were very consistent, but also by those two different product lines or service lines, both FortiCare and FortiGuard. In terms of the services, we continue to see the UTM bundle of services perform very, very well. And we continue, and it\u2019s been going on now for a few years, continue to see the shift, the support side from 8x5 to 24/7, particularly on new deals. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Melissa Franchi : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Ken, I wanted to ask about the service provider space in the quarter? By my calc, I am calculating revenue down a little bit year-over-year. So can you just maybe give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the buying behavior in that segment? And then what your expectation is as we close out the year and head into 2020? Ken Xie : I believe our service provider do grow in year-over-year, probably like close to 10%, but slower than the average growth and overall company growth. The service provider, kind of not just Fortinet, but like you can look in the networking company, they all kind of slowdown. I believe they\u2019re in a transition plan. I think that, like I said, service provider, there\u2019s just two-part, probably Keith can help out. One is really the service provider offered a security service to their customer. The other part is where a service provider secure their own infrastructure. So the first part, service provider offer service to the customer side, we don\u2019t see any slowdown. But they do kind of try to see how to deploy some other service like Zscaler kind of service to leverage their position, their connection, their data center to offer some other service. So we do see that ramp up pretty quickly. So that\u2019s what\u2019s making our space more competitive. And service provider, because they have infrastructure, their own infrastructure, so they have a huge cost advantage compared with some new player, which they have to build their own data center or have to buy the bandwidth, which has a huge cost that\u2019s making them profit more and more difficult. And the second part for secure their own infrastructure, that part we do see some kind of a slowdown. And whether \u2013 because they try to \u2013 they\u2019ve got like a different cost structure of 5G or some other part. But we do believe that will ramp up probably next year, because we do see a lot of testing, evaluation, and we do participate in a lot of like backup announced a design that the future infrastructure together. Keith Jensen : Yes. Melissa, I think Ken\u2019s spot on. I think we\u2019re looking at two different pieces of it. One is selling to the infrastructure and the second is the MSSP. I think that selling into the infrastructure, 2018 for a variety of reasons, probably. And for many companies, it was a very good year for people selling into the infrastructure. So 2019 is probably suffering a little bit, just by comparisons. And then the second part of it is the MSSP, the Managed Security Service Providers. I think we feel very, very good about what we\u2019re seeing there with our telcos, both in the U.S. and internationally. Melissa Franchi : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. Seems like you guys are gaining share, just looking at product growth. Just wondering what the competitive response has been, particularly around pricing and discounting. Ken Xie : We have a much better total cost of ownership, TCO, compared to any of our competitor. If you look at \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re using this Security Computing Rating to compare. You can see easily all causes of a fraction of any of our competitor have to perform the same like security function or support, right. So that\u2019s where \u2013 so we don\u2019t see, like in the next few years, maybe people have got any of this advantage compared to competitors if they really want to compete in on the cost on the performance side and also on the security. Because they\u2019re much more computing power, we can enable much more security function and also go much deeper in a security function than any of our competitors. So that\u2019s where we \u2013 you can see the margin. We\u2019re keeping improving. And for us to grow faster, it\u2019s really try to have like most sales coverage, more marketing coverage. And at the same time, like working closely together with the partner, with customer to follow the change in the whole industry. And whether the fabric approach or security driven networking, internal segmentation, the 5G and the OT security, so there\u2019s a lot of in there we\u2019re working right now, we believe will benefit both our customer partner in the next 5 to 10 years. Keith Jensen : Yes. Melissa, I would just add to this \u2013 to that. It\u2019s Keith. Discounting in the quarter was clearly a tailwind for us. We\u2019re very, very pleased where we ended up on the discounting spectrum year-over-year. Melissa Franchi : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Dan Bartus : Hey, thanks, guys. This is Dan Bartus on for Tal. I wanted to ask two technology questions. First is your endpoint acquisition. Did I hear right that it\u2019s mainly about adding the EDR capabilities? And if so, how do you think this may impact your Symantec partnership, if at all? Ken Xie : I think we do have some like our own endpoint solution. So this acquisition will help us enhance that. But our approach is more like driven by the network security part, which is FortiGate, which is a part of fabric. We still have a more close partnership with Symantec. At the same time, on the go-to-market strategy, we\u2019re also working more closely together. So they do have a much bigger coverage in the lot of enterprise and then we have more coverage in the network security. It\u2019s a win-win partnership, will benefit both company. Dan Bartus : Got you. Makes sense. And then kind of related, sorry if I missed it, but these SD-WAN deals that you guys are doing, are they also typically taking your secure web gateway offering? Or are they typically pairing it with another vendor? And maybe you can talk about how that might change, whether it\u2019s a large or midsize enterprise? Ken Xie : Actually, for the secure web gateway, the West market, a lot of them, to access all this at the same time, you do need to have at least one connection there. So it\u2019s actually helping both. And at the same time, you look at a lot of other like player, so because they don\u2019t have a \u2013 they don\u2019t have the device on the premise there, like I say, the networking side and the cloud side is a totally different concept. The cloud cannot replace a network. They need a network to access the cloud. At the same time, from a user angle, they probably need to use like the Secure Computing Rating to measure whether the cost or how deep the security they can go and also how the performance they can get. Because sometimes, when you forward data to the cloud, that data is also starting to become less secure, whether you cannot encrypt during the process forward of the cloud cost or Secure Computing Rating much worse compared to some points there. So that\u2019s where they need from the total cost ownership and also total security angle to address with an architecture approach they have. But I do believe that there\u2019s both side have their own kind of advantage. At the same time, I don\u2019t think that both side is already kind of at each other\u2019s market share. It\u2019s a little bit different approach. Dan Bartus : Got it. Thanks very much, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Hey guys. Good evening. Two questions. One, you mentioned, Keith, a couple of times that you benefited from discounting. Can you talk about, first of all, is that across the board? Is that again in the Gateway Network segment? Or is it across the board? And what\u2019s driving that? Because this has typically been a very competitive market where discounting has been strong. Keith Jensen : Yes. Discounting was across the board. I think we got a fair amount of lift out of the Americas on it. But I saw it across the board, both in terms of geographies and across product offerings or product suites. I think it really brings home the notion that, and Ken alluded to it, for security effectiveness, security performance, security power, for what you\u2019re paying for a Fortinet solution versus what you\u2019re getting, we have a competitive advantage there. And so the discounting part of the conversation should, and I think we saw in the quarter, hit our competitors who are going up against us more harder than it hits us. Michael Turits : Okay. And then, Ken, it was very interesting what you said about competing or selling into the service providers from an MSP perspective and talking about them utilizing Zscaler as a solution also. So is that \u2013 typically, you\u2019ve been very strong in selling your appliances there. Is that a competitive or a substitute product for you right now to sell against Zscaler? And how are you competing with that offering? Ken Xie : We\u2019re more like supporting a service provider offer similar solution. Because the service provider, they do own a lot of data center connectivity infrastructure. And in the past, they offer a little bit different kind of service, whether using the appliance or securing the data center. Now they also can make half or certain whether they call the process to secure data in the data center or some other approach, right? So that\u2019s where we\u2019re most supporting service provider, give them the flexibility, what kind of a service, what kind of a way they want to offer, we\u2019re also supporting behind, whether by forwarding the traffic data to their data center. The process, or they want to process locally on edge and leverage the other part, like a clean pipe or some other way to approach. So we do offer them multiple solution for service provider, depending on service provider and their customer need. So that\u2019s just Mike, Zscaler type of service just one type of service, and service provider offering right now. Michael Turits : Great. Thank you, guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon, Ken. Congrats on strong set of results and the guidance for the upcoming quarter. Keith, not to beat a dead horse, but I want to go back to the gross margin, healthy performance this quarter. You\u2019ve mentioned several times that it\u2019s going to be back probably to a more normalized range. But on the other hand, you also flagged the favorable discounting trends, the ASP, the product mix. Can you drill down slightly more into those components? Was it the discounting? Was it the product mix? Anything specific that stood out. Or just a combination? And I have a follow-up. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 we had \"contributions\" to the gross margin from the discount, but also the deal mix that came through in the quarter. We also had, as some of our products have matured, you tend to get cost savings on a per unit cost. We saw that trend continue through the quarter. And we also had a bit of benefit on what we would call our indirect product COGS, things like reserves and so forth and overhead. All 3 of those contributed to it in the quarter. Ken Xie : I think the one side, you see some time when you sell a part, there for certain competition, whether on discounting or price competition. But on the other side, because we have a huge computing power SPU, so we can easily add additional function like SD-WAN, which are able additional service. Our service tend to have a much better margin compared with the product. So that will help. The other trend we see is really, so we call the fabric approach. So the multi-product selling together. That\u2019s where the fabric grows much faster than a FortiGate path. That\u2019s also making the sales cost, the deal size get bigger, so that also help improve the margin. So that\u2019s where we do see some time, when there\u2019s less competition, you may compete on certain product pricing. But overall, we\u2019re keeping improving the margin by additional service, by additional product bundled together. Shaul Eyal : Got it. This is great color. Thank you for that addition Ken. And I want to touch also on Europe, on EMEA. So very consistent performance in the region. But you flagged out, I believe, both the U.K. and Germany. So can you talk to us a little bit about some of the dynamics that you have seen there during the quarter? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think only slightly because we anticipated that we were going to get asked about it. I would offer that U.K. and Germany were slightly below the rest of the company in terms of total growth. But again, given our diversification of business, it\u2019s not significant enough to have really any sort of impact on our growth rate. Shaul Eyal : Fair enough. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Jonathan Ho : Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to maybe start out with a little bit of color in terms of the initial reception for some of your, I guess, AWS-based products like the WAF as a service. And maybe any commentary you have around cloud spending on the public cloud. Keith Jensen : Look, I think we may offer a little more granularity on it a couple of weeks at the Analyst Day. But both cloud and fabric are growing more than twice the rest of the company in terms of growth period over the period. You want to talk more about WAF or? Ken Xie : Yes, I think he has a pretty good \u2013 I think we\u2019ll probably go through more detail even with some sales exactly \u2013 or even for a customer to present together in the Analyst Day in the next couple of weeks. Jonathan Ho : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, one of the things that we wanted to understand a little bit better is just the entire SD Branch concept to where you\u2019re selling more than just SD-WAN, but maybe bundling some other products in conjunction with the core SD-WAN and gateway. Can you maybe talk about how does that maybe add to the size of the deals or maybe help differentiate Fortinet just by being able to offer a lot more capability? Ken Xie : SD Branch may be referred to some branch SMB part, which they more prefer like a single box, easy to manage and at the same time can extend into the WiFi, some other networking area. So we do see that also growing together with SD-WAN approach, but it\u2019s just a subset of the total infrastructure approach we have and \u2013 but we do see, like \u2013 is the other part, whether the fabric and the SD-WAN, some other part. It\u2019s kind of like a concept we call secure driven networking. And that\u2019s where we \u2013 in the big enterprise, you need to do internal segmentation. But within a branch, you probably try to consolidate some kind of different product or different solution together. Jonathan Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Prichard with Citi. Walter Prichard : Hi, thanks. I guess two related questions. A question and a follow-up. On the 26% that was the non-network security. Can you help us understand maybe stack rank product families and especially interested if SD-WAN is now the largest product in that piece of non-network security? Keith Jensen : No, SD-WAN has got no real impact on the mix, if you will, of the business between FortiGate and non-FortiGate, if that\u2019s the question. And then in terms of the contributors in the fabric suite of products, it\u2019s the same it\u2019s been before, which is FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer as well as our virtual firewalls. Ken Xie : Yes. The SD-WAN function is included in the FortiGate. It\u2019s part of the FortiOS function there. So that\u2019s where \u2013 so the SD-WAN is not counted within 26%. It\u2019s other non-Fortigate part. I think one problem \u2013 SD Branch probably helped a little bit. But SD-WAN is always in the FortiGate. Walter Prichard : Okay. And then just related to cloud security, you mentioned virtual firewalls. Can you talk about what drove within that cloud category the performance in the quarter. It sounds like that was a driver of the strength? Ken Xie : That\u2019s where we see we have a multi-cloud, hybrid cloud and also like a more consistent offer, a broad offering for customers, whether they use an appliance on the enterprise or whatever, or go to the cloud or virtualize it. So it\u2019s really a broad offering, consistently give the customer flexibility, whether they want to deploy the function on-premise in their plans, or they want to deploy in the cloud. And we can easily move back and forth. But also while interesting, we did some calculation, you see we call this secure Computing Rating. So the cloud offering tend to have a much higher cost compared to our on-premise offering that we have using whether like an ASIC approach or some other approach. And that\u2019s where \u2013 but some of it, probably because customers want to have certain flexibility or the management, usually, they may still chosen not. But we can easily point out to the customer, it\u2019s their choice and we offer all these broad coverage also on the multiple cloud provider or other function we have, like we have almost 10 different products. You can buy whether appliance or you can buy and virtualize on the cloud from FortiGate and FortiManager, Analyzer, sandboxing and same, there\u2019s quite a broad offering we offer to customer to give them flexibility to select whatever they want to deploy. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I mean we talk cloud not only with the cloud providers, but it\u2019s also private clouds as well that we\u2019re providing solutions to. Walter Prichard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg Moskowitz : Hey, thank you very much, and good afternoon, guys. Getting back to the enSilo acquisition. Ken, obviously, there are many endpoint security vendors out there. And so I was curious if you could elaborate on what drew you to them in particular? Ken Xie : They are all, we call, the fabric partner. They\u2019re working together quite a while and working all together well and also have a very successful go-to-market approach, just like the same thing we did for the FortiNAC, a company, a Bradford Networks that we did about one year ago. So that\u2019s where now we have close to 100 partners, 100 Forti fabric partners. So that\u2019s where probably, we all need to starting from that angle first. Make sure we can work together first. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just for Keith. So as you mentioned, both the Americas and EMEA grew very well this quarter, your revenue growth in Asia Pac, though, I think, did decelerate. And I know that you were facing a tougher compare. Just wondering if there was anything else that you would call out? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think that \u2013 I guess, that\u2019s going to give us something to work on in the fourth quarter, right, bringing Asia Pacific back to a healthier growth pattern than we saw in the third quarter. Probably a little bit of hiring lag for the first part of the year. I think, by comparison, we feel very good about the conversation we had at the beginning of the year about needing to get to the U.S. and the Americas team focused on hiring, and we see the results of that. So I think we\u2019ll spend a little time with APAC next quarter. Ken Xie : So that\u2019s probably the major part of it, but also our small part is also APAC, they tend to sell a little bit more low end, and then we do have some kind of product transition. That\u2019s where some service provider, some partner, they wait a little bit, like when we announced the 60F today, make it available right away. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re helping because the new generation will have a much better performance and about the same cost. Gregg Moskowitz : That\u2019s great color. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Ives with Wedbush. Daniel Ives : Yes. Can you talk about government deals? Are they starting to get larger in terms of especially if there\u2019s a move to cloud on the securities? Are you starting to see those changes on the federal in terms of pipeline? Keith Jensen : So when we talk about government for our business, you keep in mind, it\u2019s international governments and it\u2019s some U.S. federal, but it also includes on the U.S. side, state and local governments. I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s anything driving out of the U.S. Fed business that\u2019s impacting our business one way or the other in terms of deal sizes. Daniel Ives : Okay. Thanks. And can you just talk about just generally like hiring plans from a sales rep perspective? Like, is that something you think is going to stay steady? Accelerate? How would you kind of, from a high level, think about that over the next six to 12 months? Ken Xie : They\u2019re improving. So you can see last quarter, Q3, we do add more headcount. And \u2013 but there\u2019s some region, certain verticals still behind, like Keith mentioned, APAC. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re keeping improving there. And I think with more sales capacity, with more marketing coverage, we can grow faster. Daniel Ives : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Ray McDonough : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Ray McDonough on for Brad. Ken, just a follow-up on the enSilo acquisition. I know you mentioned you had a strong partnership with them. And the company has some very interesting technology. But having been around for several years and the price you paid seems to imply they weren\u2019t generating a lot of revenue or not growing very well, or a combo of the two. What, if anything, do you see that you might be able to do with the technology that maybe the company wasn\u2019t able to achieve on a stand-alone basis? Ken Xie : It\u2019s pretty interesting, quite a few of our acquisitions are very similar. They have a great technology. They have a great team there. But then they need much more investment for go-to-market. So that\u2019s where we kind of tend to like these kind of companies so they can leverage our sales force and also customer base to quickly help them to improve in the go-to-market side. At the same time, we also want to make sure we can integrate well together. And so we don\u2019t want to create too many different micro product approach, but integration is very key. That\u2019s where we most study from the Forti fabric partners side first and make sure we can integrate, and then that\u2019s where the decision we made. And we do believe they have a great product regime. Ray McDonough : And then one for Keith, if I could. I might have missed it, but can you share what unit shipment growth was in the quarter? Keith Jensen : We didn\u2019t provide it, but I would say that what we\u2019re seeing most recently that unit shipment growth is moving right in tandem with product revenue growth. Ray McDonough : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So first, could you give us a sense for the main drivers for your success in competing in the enterprise segment? And maybe give us a sense for how the pipeline has evolved over the past year. Ken Xie : I think there\u2019s multiple angle from the technology product side. We feel all solution product technology fit better for the changing for the trend. Like I said, the security border disappeared in enterprise, so you need to go inside, add internal segmentation. You also need to expand in the WAN and also working with service provider for the other cloud approach, mobile approach, all these kinds of things. And then the fabric, also, we \u2013 because all fabrics are most of products we build internally, it\u2019s integrated, automated from Day 1. It\u2019s worked much better compared to some other competitor. They have to all depend on acquisition. And so that\u2019s really helping the enterprise, overall infrastructure security and also making the deal like larger and also most sticky with the customer. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think, Ken \u2013 the concepts Ken\u2019s talking about, the security value is clearly at play here with the enterprises. But also, as Ken talked about in his prepared remarks, being in the Gartner Magic Quadrant now for three years in a row has really served to open up the door and getting us invited to RFPs that five years ago, we probably didn\u2019t even know exist. And I think we\u2019ve become pretty good and benefit from then following that up with things like NSS Labs certifications and recommendations, too many S in that, I\u2019m sorry. But that third-party testing, if you will, I think once you\u2019re in and you have the opportunity, you\u2019re offering them these recommendations from third-parties together with our security value does indeed make a fairly compelling opportunity for us. Ken Xie : Also, we kind of more invest in the sales team and also the marketing approach there. That\u2019s also helpful. So it\u2019s really like additional sales coverage and more focus in enterprise. And also, we have a better internal tool to tracking whether the enterprise account coverage or the sales productivity. And so I think all these different parts are helping improving enterprise sales. Ken Talanian : Okay. Great. And earlier, you mentioned that we take a look at the Gartner data with regards to SD-WAN. And it sounds like SD-WAN is essentially included in FortiGate. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how we should think about the accounting for a revenue recognition for deals with SD-WAN? And any kind of framework we can think about in terms of the uplift that you might see to a deal that\u2019s driven by that requirement. Keith Jensen : Always good to have a GAAP conversation to close the call. So thank you for that. Yes, there\u2019s no difference in the accounting for it because you\u2019re selling a FortiGate appliance that has embedded with it a whole bunch of different functionalities, one of which \u2013 SSL would be one as an example. Another would be SD-WAN functionality. And so you recognize the appliance upfront. All the appliances, well, I shouldn\u2019t say all, the majority of the appliances attached out of FortiCare, FortiGuard security subscription with them. And so that part of the deal is allocated to deferred revenue and then recognized over time. But you still receive on the FortiGate, the appliance. We\u2019re still recognizing that revenue upfront. Ken Talanian : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Speakers, I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to call \u2013 turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Great. Thank you, Sherry. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today and let you know that Fortinet will be hosting an Analyst Day on November 18 as well as attending the following investor conferences during the fourth quarter.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Peter Salkowski. Please go ahead sir. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Sherri. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet\u2019s financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2019. Speakers on today\u2019s call are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results, providing our guidance for the first quarter and full-year of 2020, before opening the call for questions. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please keep your questions brief and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that on today\u2019s call, we will be making Forward-Looking Statements and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings in particular the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also all references to financial metrics that we make on today\u2019s call are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today\u2019s remarks, both of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results. We are pleased with our very strong fourth quarter performance. Builders increased 24% to $802 million driven by solid execution and growth across each of our markets EMEA and APAC. Revenue increased 21% to $640 million with product revenue up 19% and service revenue up 23%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27%. For 2019 builders increased 21% to $2.6 billion. Revenue was up 20% to $2.2 billion and our non-GAAP operating margin was 25%. This strong result was driven by our advanced FortiGate technology with SPU and Secure SD-WAN, our integrated security fabric platform and hybrid multi-cloud offerings. Fortinet was recently named one of the top three vendor in the 2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure. FortiGate security driven networking approach to SD-WAN offer customers the most comprehensive solution with security enterprise-grade networking capability integrate in a single box. Our unique approach has allowed us to gain significant market share over the past 12 months. With more than 21,000 companies using Fortinet\u2019s Secure SD-WAN solution and 70% of our top-tier service provider offer our SD-WAN solution. We are now the leading SD-WAN vendors. Today, we announced the release of FortiGate 40F, the most affordable next-generation firewall with secure SD-WAN. The 40F include our new SoC4 security processor. The 40F delivers security computer reaching of three to 23 times faster than industry average price, which use generic CPUs. The traditional parameter based network security has expanded across the entire infrastructure. To the wide area network including SD-WAN and 5G and put a local area network including the Wi-Fi and internal segmentation. Fortinet ability to offer security driven networking and high-performance with our SPU technology are clearly competitive advantages. Going forward, we are working hard to ensure that Fortinet three growth engine will help us grow faster than our competition and the market overall. First, we continue to gain market share in network security driven by our SPU competitive advantage. Our SPU technology enable us to add cutting-edge security and network functionality including SD-WAN, while maintaining strong performance despite network traffic continued to increase. The introduction of the new FortiSPU like SoC4 and NP7 as well as the first FortiGate product built with NP7 to be announced later this month is expected to widen our competitive advantage. The second growth engine is our security fabric platform included hybrid and multi-cloud deployment. Unlike competitive platform that bring together loosely integrate acquired solutions Fortinet Security Fabric which from the beginning was most developed internally offer a broad automated and truly integrated security platform for end-to-end protection, making it easier for customer to consolidate a few security vendors. Third, our engineer focused culture of continuous innovation strongly positioned Fortinet for long-term growth and competitive advantage. It is at least three times the technology pattern computer competition. Fortinet IoT, OT, 5G, hybrid cloud and edge solutions are leading the transition to the latest generation of cybersecurity. I want to thank the Fortinet team and our partners for their ongoing hard work and our customers for their support. Now I will turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our fourth quarter and full-year performance and to provide guidance for 2020. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Let me first note that except for revenue. Financial amounts are non-GAAP and growth rates are based on comparisons to the fourth quarter and full-year of 2018 unless stated otherwise. The slide references I make refer to the presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. I would now like to provide a summary of our strong fourth quarter performance and follow-up on certain metrics from the Analyst Day. We believe the metrics we shared last November highlight our diversity by geography, customer size, industry segments and solutions as well as provide insights into our financial model. Let\u2019s start our fourth quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $614 million was up 21%. Revenue growth was led by the fabric and cloud segments with over 30% growth followed by network security growth at 18%. Product revenue growth was 19% or $239 million benefiting from both legacy firewall use cases and consistent with Ken\u2019s SD-WAN commentary from continued adoption of our FortiGate-based secure SD-WAN solution. Simply put, our secure SD-WAN firewall use case combines in a single appliance security, with application-aware routing that can lower MPLS and other costs. The fourth quarter revenue growth of 19% was consistent with our strong third quarter performance even when faced with a more difficult year-over-year comparison. We believe our product revenue growth may be among the highest in this network security industry. Moving to service revenue. Our higher-margin service revenue increased 23% to $376 million and represented 61% of total revenue, increasing 10 points in four years. FortiGuard security subscription revenue increased 24% to $205 million. FortiCare Technical Support and other service revenue increased 21% to $170 million. Renewal rates remained consistent with prior periods and within the guidelines we provided at the Analyst Day. Deferred revenue at the beginning of the fourth quarter accounted for approximately 90% of service revenue. Revenue growth on a geographic basis saw the Americas up 23%, APAC up 22%, and EMEA up 19%. Before continuing with our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our revenue performance for the year. Total revenue for the full-year grew 20% to $2.2 billion. Product revenue grew 17%. Service revenue grew 21% and represented 63% of total revenue. Returning to the fourth quarter with a focus on billings. Total billings increased 24% to $802 million. Network security products and service billings increased 20% and accounted for 73% of total billings. Illustrating the continued traction with our Fabric platform and cloud strategies non-network security billings increased 35%. In Europe, we saw Germany performed better than planned, while in the U.K. billings declined. The U.K. decline appears related to Brexit distractions and we expect U.K. billings growth will return to positive territory in the current quarter. Looking at billings by vertical, service providers and MSSPs accounted for 18% of total billings. And we experienced outpaced growth from government, financial services, retail and education. As a follow-up to the Analyst Day, we are not the top five verticals again accounted for 65% of total billings. At year-end, total deferred revenue increased 27% to $2.1 billion and short-term deferred revenue increased 22% to $1.2 billion. Looking now at deal sizes and illustrating our continued expansion in the enterprise market. Deals over $1 million increased 36% to 64 deals. Secure SD-WAN was a leading contributor to the increase in the number of deals in excess of $1 million accounting for 10 deals in the quarter up from four deals last year. And with a reference to our diversification, we have now completed 11 quarters in a row without a single transaction representing over 2% of quarterly billings. The number of deals over $250,000 increased 29% to 469 and the number of deals over $500,000 increased 53% to 197. In the fourth quarter, our average contract term increased one month to 26 months. As we noted at the Analyst Day, secure SD-WAN transactions included a greater mix of enterprise customers and somewhat longer contract terms. Moving back to the income statement. In the fourth quarter, gross margin improved 230 basis points to 78%. Product gross margin improved 400 basis points to 61.9%. As we saw in the third quarter, product gross margin benefited from gains in average selling price as well as lower direct unit cost and indirect cost. We are pleased with the product gross margin improvement we have achieved in each of the last two quarters. Services gross margin increased 90 basis points to 88.2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 110 basis points to 26.8%. The improvement in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in the pace of hiring mostly in sales and marketing, lower sales attrition and spending associated with recent M&A activity. For the full-year, gross margin was 77.5%, up 150 basis points from 2018, benefiting from a 190 basis point improvement in product gross margin. And for the full-year, the operating margin was 24.5%, up 220 basis points from 2018. Total headcount ended the year at 7,082, an increase of 21% from the end of 2018. However, the two fourth quarter acquisitions increased headcount by 135. Excluding these two acquisitions, headcount would have increased 19%. Given the strong operating income performance, net income for the fourth quarter was $132 million or $0.76 per diluted share. Net income for the full-year was $432 million, an increase of 35% resulting in earnings per diluted share of $2.47. On a GAAP basis, we reported full-year net income of $327 million or $1.87 per diluted share. This represents our 11th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. Our milestones, we have been able to achieve every year since becoming a publicly traded company in 2009. Moving to the statement of cash flows summarized on slides 10, 11 and 12. Adjusted free cash flow for 2019 increased 28% to $776 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $47 million, including $36 million on real estate spending. For 2020, capital expenditures are expected to be between $210 million to $240 million, which includes spending on the campus expansion. We expect first quarter total capital expenditures to between $25 million and $35 million, again including spending on the campus expansion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 303,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $23 million. For the full-year, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for a total cost of $141 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.6 billion with a plan set to expire at the end of February 2021. Before wrapping up with guidance, I would like to offer information on two additional areas : our fourth quarter acquisitions and also SD-WAN. First on the M&A side, we completed two technology and talent tuck-in acquisitions in late October and December. With the combined contribution to fourth quarter revenue was significantly less than 1%, these acquisitions pulled down fourth quarter operating margin by approximately one-half of a percentage point. We expect the impact from these acquisitions on first quarter and full-year 2020 operating margins to be roughly a 100 basis point headwind. Second, our secure SD-WAN offering continues to be a point of differentiation for Fortinet. In the fourth quarter, Secure SD-WAN billings represented high single-digits of total billings. In 2019 for the full-year, Secure SD-WAN added about seven points to product revenue growth and represented mid to high single-digits of total billings. On a full-year basis, there were no significant changes to the year-to-date third quarter metrics for Secure SD-WAN that we provided at the Analyst Day. Service contracts continue to attach to the FortiGate at a rate consistent with other FortiGate use cases. And finally, new logos continue to account for approximately 50% of secure SD-WAN billings. Next I would like to review our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2020 summarized on slide 13 which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $635 million to $655 million; revenue in the range of $555 million to $565 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 19% to 20%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52 which assumes a share count of between $175 million to $177 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. As I begin to provide 2020 guidance, I would like to remind everyone of the financial model expectations for the next three years that was provided at the November Analyst Day. For the period from 2020 through the end of 2022, we expect organic billings and revenue growth to be at least 15% for each of the next three years. And non-GAAP operating margin to average at least 25% during this three-year period. For 2020, we expect billings in the range of $3,025,000,000 to $3,075,000,000. Revenue in the range of $2,525,000,000 to $2,555,000,000. Total service revenue in the range of $1,635,000,000 to $1,655,000,000. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 23.5% to 24.5%. While we estimate the recent acquisitions will be a 100 basis point year-to-year headwind to our 2020 operating margin included in the numbers above, we believe our operating margin over the next three years will average at least 25%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.70 to $2.73, which assumes a share count of between 180 million and 182 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 24%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $40 million. Along with Ken, I would like to welcome the CyberSponse. And again, the enSilo teams to Fortinet and thank our partners, our customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work. With that, I will hand the call back over to Peter. Peter Salkowski : Thank you very much Keith. Operator, we are ready to open up for Q&A please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Essex : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question, and congratulations on some nice results. I was wondering Keith maybe you could unpack the guidance a little bit. Coming in particularly on the growth side of the equation several hundred basis points over your kind of at least 50% - 15% guide on the Analyst Day. What is the confidence there come from? And what are some of the levers that could, I guess, give us some comfort that there is your appropriate level of conservatism in that number? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think the - when you look at our longer-term model you are probably looking more at Gartner growth rates in terms of what you expect to see from SD-WAN what you expect to see the network firewall. And what you see - and what you expect to see in the Fabric. And I think the guidance is certainly within those ranges when you factor in our historical ability to outgrow the market. I think as you get - if you pull that in particularly to say the first quarter or even the current year, it is much more based upon the pipeline. And when we look at the pipeline and the opportunities that we see in the pipeline it clearly supports the guidance that we have just provided. Ken Xie : Also we do increase the sales capacity with the additional hiring and sales and marketing reaching close to 20% total headcount increase will definitely help to drive that additional growth. Brian Essex : Got it. That is helpful. And maybe if I could follow-up with a quick one on the current results for the quarter. Product revenue nicely strong in the high teens in services revenue as well during a quarter where maybe some of your peers sound a little more challenging to put up positive product revenue growth at the very least. How much did I guess SD-WAN and Fabric contribute to each of those segments? And how might you view the overall spending environment for core firewall considering the results that you had? And I did hear you comment on high single-digit SD-WAN contribution, but if maybe you could paint a bigger picture of other contributing factors to those line items? And the spending environment overall would be really helpful? Ken Xie : Yes, this is Ken. For the network security, we believe we are keenly gaining a lot of market share, because the product architecture with our own ASIC how we call SPU is has huge concrete and power and keeping adding whether security function or the networking function of SD-WAN. Even the product we announced today like that is from 3x to 23x more powerful than other competitor industry average. So this will make us keeping gaining market share. And also SD-WAN market last year is about 1.5 billion and they grow 15% year-over-year in the next few years. So we are not a leading vendor SD-WAN with the most customers and also service provider also starting adopt our SD-WAN solution. So we do believe we are also keeping gaining share in that space. So that also will help us. And that the Fabric, you can see almost double the network security growth because our Fabric is mostly internal develop and well integrated. That is more easy to like upsell, cross-sell once some product adding in and because of the other part of Fabric kind of working together quite well. So that is where customers see the benefit of consolidation. So we see that is also a growth driver. There is a few other new technology. We also pioneered and - but that is probably more long-term maybe still a few more years to see more materialized but we do - we also lead in some of the technology change in unit space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Fantastic. And I will echo my congratulations. What a real strong finish to 2019 and impressive guidance as well. Ken, if I can ask you a question. As I look to competing SD-WAN solutions out in the market, I think there are some out there that take a different architectural approach in delivering it mainly as a cloud service. Aside from customer preference, can you maybe speak to the architectural trade-off of centering the functionality in the cloud versus delivering it as you do? Ken Xie : I think by moving some applications to the cloud actually helping like multi-deployment in SD-WAN. And at the same time even within the cloud there is a few research actually weather from the government and I say all come from like academia like CMU is that the cloud actually increased the security risk. And that is where even within the cloud you also need to secure the cloud itself. So that is also helping like we call hyperscale some other kind of approach to get inside the network. And so that is probably beyond the traditional - I mean the one SD-WAN side. So that is where we kind of working with a lot of service provider, cloud provider and make SD-WAN part of the total offering. And then we also understand sometime they have their own business model. We most supporting each other instead of more competing on each other. So that is kind of the ecosystem study working quite well for us. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. That is very helpful, Ken. And Keith, if I could just follow-up with a quick one for you. DSOs seem to be running a little bit hot. Can you comment at all on linearity. I mean at the same time you have obviously guided to a very nice Q1 and full-year next year. But any color on the jump would be helpful? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think the math of DSO. We picked up about a day from the acquisitions. That pretty much puts us back in line with what you would expect normally. I would offer my experience in high-tech and the Christmas holiday season is always very busy. I still think Fortinet\u2019s unusual. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Melissa Franchi : Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a solid quarter. Ken, it looks like you are seeing good growth in large deals and multimillion dollar deals. And I know that you said that SD-WAN is a leading contributor to strength there. But I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide more color on what those deals look like? Is it your existing customers that are refreshing at the branch, or are you displacing some competitor solutions that are coming and you are coming in because of the SD-WAN capability? Ken Xie : So half the SD-WAN customer are new customer, especially come from large enterprise. That also enable us to get into the traditional enterprise network security space or even the internal occupancy. The traditional parameter based network security now need to be expanded to the WAN side like SD-WAN 5G and also to internal like whether the internal segmentation switching the internal Wi-Fi. So that is where we see that probably internal even bigger market compared to the SD-WAN side. And so we see a huge opportunity especially we introduced the new NP7 so the first product leverage NP7 which is about five times faster than the previous chip NP6 will help us get inside a network in a very high-speed environment within the cloud. So that is also what drives additional growth. So I do see - so SD- WAN go to the one side and also go to internal network side, help us expand a lot of our new market inside enterprise and also in a lot of new customers for us. Melissa Franchi : Okay very helpful. And then I have a follow-up for Keith. Keith you mentioned that ASPs were increasing in your commentary on gross margins. Can you just maybe comment on what is driving that ASP increase? Is that just a mix shift dynamic? Or did you actually raise prices on appliances? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think what I\u2019m trying to do is parse out the fact that in the benefit to gross margin there was really three pieces to it. Indirect, which I would attribute to economies of scale that we are seeing. We have a large warehouse facility that we acquired a number of years ago that and I think that is a fairly permanent benefit on the indirect side. On the direct side, I think the operations team does a very good job of each quarter working down the average direct unit cost. And then the third component was ASP. And I kind of broaden that conversation if you will a talking point. The last quarter I attributed to discounting. And the reason for that is, I would put discounting as a component of ASP, but I also want to give some credit to the ability to the company if you will to maintain a somewhat normal price list changes you have from time-to-time and not giving up those back - giving those back in discounting. Ken Xie : Other economist scale working is really the ASIC chip, right? So we are the number one unit shipment probably more than the number two, number three, number four combine as well it help us really kind of a lower average cost of per ASIC chip, which gives us huge computing power over the generic CPU, the competitor using. So that is also helping driving the cost lower? Melissa Franchi : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon gentlemen. Congrats on a strong performance. Keith or Ken, Germany and the U.K. or maybe we should call it Frankfurt and London, tale of the two countries, tale of two cities. Talk to us a little bit about what has been driving the strength in Germany? And why do you expect the U.K. to bounce back in the first quarter? Keith Jensen : Yes. sorry, Ken, I didn\u2019t mean to jump on you. I think in Germany, I think it has been a balanced growth throughout the quarter. I think we came into the quarter with perhaps some concerns given the economy there in Germany. But the diversification that we see within the country I think paid off for us. I think in the U.K. to answer the question very specifically, when I look at the pipeline in Q1 versus what we saw in Q4, I feel very comfortable to comment about it returning to positive growth in the quarter. Shaul Eyal : Fair enough. Fair enough. And maybe a lot of the same lines that, I pass at APAC? What is driving that? And do you see that contribution or growth as sustainable within that region? Ken Xie : Yes. APAC has a pretty good fourth quarter. And also we starting to speed up some hiring there, which is a little bit behind early last year, which also can helping drive the future growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is now open. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Ken, I will start with you. Just with regards to SD-WAN tremendous momentum there. I wanted to understand just from a strategy perspective, how you are pitching the SD-WAN value proposition to your telco and service provider and carrier partners, because to some extent the secure SD-WAN proposition is counter to the other areas of telco\u2019s businesses like the MPLS stream. So I wanted to better understand what your strategy is with telcos? And then I have a follow-up for Keith if I may. Ken Xie : Yes, it is a lower total cost of ownership, especially we have a one box solution compared to some other order network vendor whatever they didn\u2019t have a two, three box one for SD-WAN and one for security, one for networking. So we have all this integrated single box. And also because the huge computing power come from our SPU security process unit, so we can easily outperform and add additional function combined all the security network function together. And still like easily like three to 30 times faster than other like a single SD-WAN function part of security box. So that is the advantage we have in the technology investment for ASIC chip give us huge computing power, not just for the SD-WAN function, but also additional security function, additional network function if we keeping adding there. So that is where the service provider enterprise see huge benefit because for them they can whether using the box to - service-based revenue of kind of helping lower enterprise total cost. So that is where we see over 70% top-tier service provider offer our SD-WAN solution. So that is where we become a leading vendor. We believe we have the most customer base starting to adopt our SD-WAN 21 selling customer companies starting using our SD-WAN which combined SD-WAN security together. And also it is very interesting. So the service we offer with SD-WAN enter the highest level service we have. So we do have like a UTM service. We have enterprise service and then that we call 360 service which like including all the UTM enterprise and class all the provisional services including SD-WAN provisioning and management service. So SD-WAN definitely helping drive the additional service, additional security into a lot of new enterprise customer, half the SD-WAN deal has come from a new customer which never bought our product before. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I think just a follow-up on Ken\u2019s comment about the 30% of the SD-WAN service providers. I think we probably saw particularly in the first half of 2019 was a little bit of hesitation from the carrier and the service providers and maybe at a little to the MPLS revenue stream. But we have certainly seen a shift in that thinking I would say over the last three or four months. Fatima Boolani : That is super helpful. And Keith just for you. You are very specific about the step-up in sales hiring and sort of the higher pace of sales hiring. I\u2019m wondering if you can put a finer point on where these additional sales resources and increased sales capacity is going to be concentrated whether from the vertical or geographical or even use case perspective. I would appreciate that color. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the way I would probably respond to that question is the way we look at it in terms of adding sales capacity. And there is probably two key criteria that Ken and I talked about. One is we want to see somebody a sales leader whose demonstrated performance. So when you give them more resources that they are going to be able to execute with it. And two, that they want that additional responsibility. Now luckily we are in a very good position where that crosses geographic lines and across these verticals. But I think that is more of the playbook that we are after right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Ken I wanted to start out with as we think about the SD-WAN product road map especially here in 2020, what are some of the key elements that you would expect to introduce this year that have been missing in the solution thus far? Ken Xie : We definitely more working closely with the service provider which we kind of are more dominant in the space and offer a lot of managed SD-WAN service and also a lot of our channel partners having more working with us is producing leaders, big city and big global city leader, so they see the benefit of SD-WAN solution compared to their traditional solution. The other thing, we probably maybe with a little bit ahead right now is really the NP7, we kind of talked about in Analyst Day. And then later this month we introduced the first product beautiful NP7 accelerate in Barcelona which also will change the landscape. This is more like a product starting to go inside the network. So that is where the internal segmentation, the hyperscale some other part of - or could be even bigger market than the wide air network, which is SD-WAN we will lead in the last few years. So that is where there is a few drivers worth keeping helping us, like I still see for more help us more in the SD-WAN in the one side is that integrates seasonal on chip. And then NP7, we are helping on the local air network in a high-speed environment. So that is where we are starting to see the traditional parameter-based network security need to expand into the WAN side and also the LAN side. Sterling Auty : Got it. And then Keith I apologize I was bouncing between calls, but I apologize if you covered it, but I want to better understand the operating margin guidance here for 2020. And in particular how much of that impact is coming from the enSilo acquisition versus the increased hiring? And specifically are you at the end of this maybe increased investment phase? And how does that margin outlook for 2020 fit within your longer-term margin guide? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think very good questions. We tried to cover off in the prepared remarks that a reminder including the fact that our comment before was that from 2020 through 2022, we expect to average at least 25% operating margin during that three-year period of time. And that first and foremost that has not changed. The other data point to keep in mind in the commentary was that the M&As that kind of hit in the tail half of the fourth quarter, the drag in operating margin in the fourth quarter was about 0.5 basis point. And the drag for the next year when we have full quarter operations, it is going to be about one point of drag. And so one way of looking at it is taking our operating margin at the midpoint and then adding that point back into it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. Question on the subscription side and specifically pretty good performance on the FortiGuard there. Can you help us understand components of that as you have seen that business accelerate this year. What is been the driver of that trend? Keith Jensen : Yes. Fortiguard kind of go back to some commentary from the Analyst Day FortiGuard is about 85% of FortiGuard are bundles, security bundles. You can add to that some stand-alone security services if you will. You are also going to get - when you are trying to model it, you can also get a lag effect of when you see high product sales say higher in 2018 than they were in 2017. Those higher product sales in 2018 are going to attach service contract, which become revenue in 2019. So you are going to get the lift in 2019 from the increase in product sales in 2018. Walter Pritchard : Got it. Then just a quick one on acquired revenue how should we think about any contribution from - you said a small contribution in Q4, any contribution from the two acquisitions in the 2020 number? Keith Jensen : Yes, we have just rolled it in into the total. And I think the comment I gave was it was far less than 1% in the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t really see that changing for the balance of that I have visibility to in 2020? Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open. Jonathan Ho : Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just one for me. I just wanted to get your sense of what is happening in the cloud opportunity? You guys mentioned hybrid cloud and sort of the multi-cloud security opportunity. I just wanted to get a sense for what trends you are seeing particularly for 2020? Thank you. Ken Xie : Yes, we do see cloud as a part of our February offering. So we gave the customer flexibility whether they want to put on premise or go to cloud or chosen different cloud provider which we offered the same thing like a user interface the same software kind of a solution for them. And also we are working with a cloud provider service provider well and try to expand in that area. So that is one of the growth driver for us. We do believe both cloud and edge need to be working together, certain things good for cloud, certain things good for the edge. So that is where have the whole solution instead of only focus on one solution. So that is where we like what are the fabric on the cloud, the edge and other I mentioned like IoT, OT and the 5G or to be kind of working together to make it more secure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. Good afternoon, good evening, great quarter. Firstly for Ken, you announced the Fortinet secure SD-WAN on Equinix. So SD-WAN you said as a full-service. What are your offerings? And what is your strategy on a full cloud-based security offering that you would think of that would be analogous to this Scalar offering either for local breakout and/or for Zero-Trust network access? Ken Xie : I think the Scalar don\u2019t have the SD-WAN. And sometimes we also partnered together. And on the other side like a lot of service provider like Equinix or some other, they do have quite a broad customer base enterprise customer service provider and leverage their infrastructure. So SD-WAN definitely is a new technology solution can - like improving the service, lower the cost and that is where both the service provider and the enterprise customer all like that solution. So that is where we kind of approach from both one from end customer angle and with our own marketing force with BDR resource and the other one comes from the service provider partner with them to help in their customer to improving that lower total cost ownership. So that is where we see working with service providers one of the very important ecosystem for us. Michael Turits : And then for Keith on cash flow, this year your cash flow grew less than net income this year 20s versus in the 30s? How should we think about it going into next year? Is that just timing that reverses? Should we think about cash flow from ops growing in line with net income or EBIT next year? Keith Jensen : So if you are looking at the cash flow from operations then you are excluding the real estate, correct? You are not talking about free cash flow, Michael? Michael Turits : Not talking about free cash flow, just cash flow. Keith Jensen : Yes. There is nothing different in terms of modeling it other than just maybe when the quarter ended, how payables got paid. And obviously we will get collected. And so your premise that basically to put words in your mouth, don\u2019t look at the one quarter, but look at it over time, you are right. Michael Turits : Right. So in other words in line with net income or EBIT growth last year is a good guide? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Rob Owens : Great. And thanks for taking my question. Wanted to drill down a little bit into linearity with regard to 2020. And I know in 2019 we saw very strong back half out of you guys and obviously some of the new products in SD-WAN helped there. But you are also making that push up relative to enterprise. So are we seeing the business become a little bit more enterprise back-end weighted? Does that play out in 2020? And what should our initial linearity thoughts be? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes. Good question. We spent some time with that actually recently looking at it. And I think if you start looking at 2018\u2019s linearity by quarter that is probably a pretty good idea of what we think - 2019\u2019s linearity. We have got a pretty good idea of what 2020 will look like at least in terms of how we are modeling internally. So you are probably looking book ending the year with starting off at say at 21% and ending the year in the fourth quarter with maybe 29%, 30% kind of a model. And in between where our model where Q2 and Q3 tend to be very close together. So you are probably around the 24%, 25% number for both of those. Ken Xie : Yes. We also improved hiring in the second half of 2019, which we hope will be contributing to the 2020 growth. So that is where the sort of hiring in like a Q3, Q4 definitely we will see some sales starting ramp up to contribute in this year 2020. Rob Owens : Great. And then if we look at the large deal metrics particularly the largest of deals, are these you guys pushing up market into data center situations that are massive or more branch network types of situations? Could you unpack that a little bit for me? Thanks. Ken Xie : It is more enterprise. That is because a lot of the enterprise see the benefit of whether SD-WAN or we call the infrastructure security involved in more product in Fabric. The Fabric also helping make the deal larger. So that is where with most sales, more partner able to sell multiple products and also the SD-WAN starting at more like a big enterprise. So that definitely helped increase the deal size. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter. So I also want to ask a question on your large deal growth, we saw deals greater than $500,000 and those greater than $1 million with impressive growth again this quarter, yet your high-end appliance revenue lagged the small and midrange appliance growth. So I was just wondering if you could just provide any more color as to why are customers spending more upfront with these and so it doesn\u2019t look like they are buying - simply just buying larger appliances? Ken Xie : The new product coming like I said, it takes us almost four, five years we developed NP7. So that is where we finally released and the first part will come in later this month. So that we will have a huge advantage compared to some other product. So that will help. Keith Jensen : Yes. Andrew, this is Keith. A good follow-up question to Rob and to expand on Ken\u2019s comment. I think when you look at where the large deals are coming from I would probably say there is really three sources for those. One is the SD-WAN that we talked about. Two is the large distributed enterprise that you are referring to. And then the third is yes, having success inside the data center and displacing incumbents. And I think each of those are contributing to the growth that we are seeing in million dollar deals. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. And then just a clarification regarding your gross margin. I know you mentioned the economies of scale as contributing to that, but the guidance for 2020 is a significant expansion from 2019. And I thought that new appliances typically carry a lower gross margin at least initially. And so given the new appliances you have talked about that are coming out later this month. I was wondering if you could provide any more color as to what might be driving your gross margin higher in 2020 and offsetting that perhaps initial headwinds you normally face with the new appliance? Keith Jensen : Yes. Keep in mind we probably have 70 or 80 different firewalls on the price list at any one model at any one point in time. And then also add to that that when introducing a new product doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is going to have a significant revenue impact to a given point or to a given quarter. I think I won\u2019t overplay the new products having an impact on gross margin, unless we are doing a lot of them all at once and they are coming online. I think if you go back to what is actually to the extent you are talking about product gross margin and I think you were in your commentary, I made reference to three components. One is I think the indirect benefit is here to stay given the economies of scale. I do believe that the direct benefit Ken made reference to it with the ASIC advantage will continue to manifest itself into our pricing and into our billings. And then thirdly, I now have two quarters in a row whether you want to call it ASP increases or holding line or discounting. I\u2019m not going to commit to say that that is going to be forever. But I think those are the components that we are looking at in terms of our modeling of gross product gross margin going forward. Lastly, if you are looking at total gross margin, it is really a mix shift as well where at the moment we are probably modeling a little more services with higher margin than we are with products at this point in time. Ken Xie : Yes. Also with the two new SPU whether this is SoC4 which is working for other NP7, we have a huge computing power enhancement on the FortiGate which also enable us to keep adding a lot of new function which can also drive the service helping like a less discount and see additional huge value added with the same cost. So that also will help to improve our margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Dan Ives : Yes. Thanks. So my question specifically on the government vertical. I mean, could you just maybe talk about what is going on there. Obviously, there is a lot of lot transformation going on in deals across especially on the federal side where you guys obviously play well. So maybe just talk about that in terms of the composition of deals activity and just is anything changing on federal? Keith Jensen : Yes. Yes. I\u2019m reading my email. I saw something this morning from one of our sales people talking about. Very exciting times are coming in the U.S. Fed. But I think really what you are seeing in our model right now is really the diversity in our federal business, pardon me in our government business, which includes some benefit from the U.S. Fed, but also state local and international governments. Dan Ives : Got it. And Ken could you just hit on 5G. I mean, I know you have talked about it before, but just how you are viewing that over the next 12 months to 18 months? And where Fortinet plays in that opportunity? Thanks. Ken Xie : In which one? Dan Ives : 5G Keith Jensen : 5G. Ken Xie : Oh, 5G. I think it is still a little bit early. A certain vertical may be ahead of the consumer, we are working closely with a service provider, but I see is probably still need a couple of years out to see material impact. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Arete Research. Your line is now open. Patrick Colville : Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on seriously impressive quarter and next year\u2019s outlook. Can I ask a financial question on the free cash flow to start with? How much are you spending in 2020 for the new campus? Keith Jensen : Yes. The real estate spending will probably run between $150 million and $160 million all in next year. Patrick Colville : Got it. Okay, very clear. And then Ken can I ask you about ransomware. I do a lot of work speaking to CISOs and CIOs. And in my conversations that is probably the number one threat their facing right now. So I would love to understand from Fortinet\u2019s perspective, how at all that may be driving conversations with you guys and your customers? Ken Xie : Yes, that is a very important topic, because the majority attack today now comes from inside. So that is where internal security, internal segmentation and at the same time combined with some other like endpoint security, like the company we just acquired enSilo, and also it is really so I think they are more and more important. And then also the new NP7 definitely help driving that direction inside our company network and whether segment different department or server or data source there and even per person. So that will help embed for this ransomware attack. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Taz Koujalgi : Had a question on the [Equinix] partnership. Can you just talk a bit about the go-to-market there? Will that be sold by Equinix or will that be sold by Fortinet? And how does the rev-rec -- how will the rev-rec work in that case? Would it be still a product or will that be recognized as a service offering? Ken Xie : Probably most starting from go-to-market together. And then we are also working on some other more deeper partnership including certain products - sort of other service offering, but it is a market starting off a good partnership. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I think it is probably just a little bit early to talk about rev rec. The press release is that, it is in the last 24 hours. Taz Koujalgi : Got it. And then, just a clarification on the guide. So given that your product revenues were basically - they grew at the same rate in 2018 and 2019. Would it be fair to assume that the service revenues, there is no decline in the service revenue growth in 2020? You should basically have the same service revenue growth in 2020 that you had in 2019? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think we actually included in the guidance service revenue for the year. So I think that will probably give you a pretty good visibility to it, in the prepared comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chaim Seigel from Elazar Advisers. Your line is now open. Chaim Seigel : Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. I noticed, obviously that obviously the billings number was much higher than you thought. And I\u2019m just wondering, what was the components behind that? Keith Jensen : I think we saw a very good performance. Many, many Geos, I would count the U.S. as being a very, very strong Geo. We also did very well in our emerging markets in the quarter. It was strong, I gave you the revenue number, which is a pretty good indicator. But I think really, if I were to call out in terms of where the strength was in the quarter. I was very pleased with the U.S. in our emerging markets. Chaim Seigel : Congratulations. Keith Jensen : And I should - pardon me, I got to mention on the TAM also we did a great job again. I\u2019m going to get in trouble and they did a very good job. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yako with Cowen. Your line is now open. Nick Yako : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about fabric. I\u2019m just wondering, if you can provide any color around the percent of FortiGate customers that have deployed a fabric product? And then maybe how that is trended over the past few years? Keith Jensen : I think there is if I\u2019m understanding the question correctly, I think there is a very high correlation between fabric customers and FortiGate products. It is fairly unusual for us to sell a fabric product to somebody who is not a FortiGate product customer. Nick Yako : Right. Okay. And can you helpful color around the SD-WAN contribution in 2019? Any color on what that contribution was in 2018? Keith Jensen : Very, very small. low single digits at best probably. Nick Yako : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Sarah.

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I would like to now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thank you. Thank you, Peter. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our first quarter 2020 results. And we'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers worldwide for their commitment to manage our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Billings increased 21% to $668 million, driven by solid execution and across all three major regions. Revenue increased 22% to $577 million. The solid performance of our core firewall, security fabric, SD-WAN and work from home solution resulted in an 18% increase in product revenue and a 24% increase in service revenue. Shipment of FortiGate unit increased 30% in the first quarter, driven by our home secure VPN and secure SD-WAN product, built with our ASIC-powered appliance. In addition, demand for broad integrated automated security fabric platform, especially the FortiClient, FortiAuthenticator and FortiToken was very strong. Our ability to directly manage our supply chain and shipping logistics allowed us to quickly adjust to the current dynamic environment. Today, Fortinet released a FortiGate 4200F, another milestone in our ability to deliver the industry highest performance and the most cost efficient secure solution on the market. Powered by the new NP7, the 4200F is engineered to meet the scale and performance demand of today's enterprise and service provider companies. With 10x the VPN performance over competitors, its ability to scale teleworker solution will be a key competitive advantage for Fortinet as enterprise looks for cost efficient way to support our large, remote workforce.  During the quarter, we released the FortiOS 6.4 with over 350 new features, including new automation, scalability, performance and AI capability, providing for protection across entire digital infrastructure.  Included in the FortiOS 6.4 are several enhancements to our secure SD-WAN offerings. Fortinet is one of the fastest growing SD-WAN providers and the only major player in this market with the internally developed offering that provides security and SD-WAN networking in a single solution. We believe we'll continue to gain SD-WAN market share in 2020. Fortinet is an important strategic partner, especially as company looks to efficiently deploy their security budget, our industry-validated work from home and a secure SD-WAN offering, along with our SPU-driven FortiGates, Security Fabric platform and hybrid-cloud offerings, provide the best security with the most cost-efficient solution for companies across their entire digital infrastructure. I would now like to turn the call over to Keith for a closer look and our first quarter performance and our guidance. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Let me first note, I would like to join Ken in wholeheartedly thanking our employees and their families, and our customers, partners and suppliers for their outstanding support in managing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  With that in mind, let's start the first quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $577 million was up 22%. The fabric and cloud segment revenue growth was over 24%. The FortiGate network security revenue growth was 21%. Both our Fabric and FortiGate network security segments growth continued to benefit from our secure SD-WAN solutions.  The strong first quarter revenue growth once again illustrates the benefit of our diversification across geographies, customer segments, and industry verticals. The momentum our business has experienced is the result of our strategic internal investments made to broaden our product offerings, penetrate adjacent security markets, expand our global sales force and invest in our channel partners.  Product revenue grew 18% to $192 million, benefiting from strong demand for our FortiGate appliances, secure SD-WAN offering, integrated Fabric platform appliance and software solutions, as well as our embedded and standalone work from home security solutions.  Our growth rates and industry reports suggest we continue to take market share in both the firewall and SD-WAN markets, markets where we'd have contributed leadership and innovation.  Moving to service revenue, service revenue grew 24% to $385 million, representing 67% of total revenue. Over 90% of service revenue was from deferred revenue at the beginning of the quarter and continues to provide an increased level of revenue predictability. FortiGuard security subscription revenue increased 25% to $211 million. FortiCare technical support and other service revenue increased 23% to $173 million.  The mix shift from 8/5 to our higher price 24/7 support was 6 points. And 24/7 support now represents just over 60% of this mix.  Let's shift to billings. Total billings increased 21% to $668 million. FortiGate network security billings increased 21% and accounted for 75% of total billings. Fabric and cloud billings combined increased 32%, driven by our secure access and our work from home related offerings, including FortiToken FortiAuthenticator and FortiClient.  Once again, the diversification of our business model by industry vertical was on display in the first quarter, with our top five verticals continuing to account for about two-thirds of our total billings. Service providers and MSSPs, which we believe serve a large portion of the SMB market, topped all verticals with 19% of total billings, representing its highest percent of total billings in five quarters. Financial services had a very strong quarter, with billings growth of over 40% and represented 14% of total billings.  At the end of the first quarter, total deferred revenue increased 26% to $2.2 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 24% to $1.2 billion.  Looking at deals by dollar size. For deals over $250,000 and $500,000, the billings value increased 22% and 20% respectively. The dollar value of deals over $1 million increased 27%, illustrating our continued ability to move up market into the enterprise segment.  Moving back to the income statement, as shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 150 basis points to 78.7%. Product gross margin improved 300 basis points to 61.4%. Product gross margin benefited from over 40% growth in software products and lower indirect cost. Services gross margin increased 30 basis points to 87.4%. Operating margin for the first quarter increased 190 basis points to 22.3%, benefitting from the improvement in gross margin and lower employee travel expenses related to the shift towards work from home.  During the quarter, we entered into a seven-year mutual covenant not to sue agreement with a competitor related to our patent portfolio in return for a $50 million cash payment to Fortinet.  We recognized a GAAP gain of $36.8 million as a credit to operating expenses, and we'll recognize the remainder over the term of the agreement.  We have excluded the $50 million cash receipt from our free cash flow and the $36.8 million gain from our non-GAAP margins and other results.  Total headcount ended the quarter at 7,448, an increase of 24%, driven by increased investments we made to leverage the positive momentum in our business, while seeing improving attrition rates over the last few quarters. We do not anticipate any COVID-19-related layoffs for the foreseeable future.  Given our strong operating income performance, net income for the first quarter was $104.4 million. Our earnings per diluted share increased $0.14 to $0.60 per diluted share.  On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $104 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Including the patent-related gain noted above, GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.44 or an increase of 29%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow increased 27% to $242 million. Due to the shelter in place orders, construction was halted on the new campus building in mid-March and resumed this week.  Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $28 million, including $20 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the second quarter to between $40 million and $50 million. And for all of 2020 to between $200 million and $220 million.  We expect full-year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million and our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%.  In the first quarter, we utilized a portion of our cash and investments to repurchase approximately 10 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $900 million. At the end of first quarter, the remaining share buyback authorization was $693 million.  In light of the buyback activity, together with a lower interest rate environment, let me offer two modeling insights. First, the full year share count should be 10 million shares lower than previously guided.  Second, interest income will likely be insignificant for the remainder of 2020.  Before moving to guidance, we wanted to offer some thoughts in two areas related to COVID-19, including steps that we have taken to contribute and certain observations about our business in Q1 and early Q2.  First, in response to the pandemic, we've taken a number of steps, including, one, substantially increasing our employee charitable match program for COVID-19 related donations to a total of $2 million.  And secondly, expanding our free to the public network security expert program, or what we call NSE. Last week, we further expanded the free NSE program from the first three levels to all eight levels. NSE is a self-paced online security training and certification program. By making this program free and more advanced, we hope to narrow the shortage of security skilled workers around the world and position people to emerge from COVID-19 with new and very marketable skills. In the first week, we've had over 50,000 registrations from over 5,000 different organizations.  And I'd like to share some observations about our business in Q1 and early Q2. We don't anticipate that these observations will continue in future quarters. However, in light of COVID-19, we thought they might be helpful and informative.  Looking at linearity, monthly linearity for the first quarter was consistent with prior quarters at around 50% through the first two months. While March linearity was typical, we did see an elevated level of buying during the middle two weeks of the month.  As for April linearity, it was slightly better than our first month performance for any second quarter in the last three years. Turning the contract length and payment terms. In Q1, the average contract length remained flat at 25 months year-over-year. And average contractual payment terms increased, but less than 15%.  In terms of supply chain concerns, our product backlog was in line with historical averages and our suppliers delivered over 90% of their commitment to us. To offer some context on the puts and takes in Q1 billings, three of our Fabric platform products, FortiToken, FortiAuthenticator and FortiClient benefited from their increased value in securing organizations' employees in the shift towards work from home. Combined billings for these three products were about $10 million above expectations. In April, we saw these billings again significantly outperform expectations.  Looking at channel inventory, the total balance was flat quarter-over-quarter and up slightly year-over-year, which may relate to a small level of early buying by our customers.  Regarding SD-WAN solutions, secure SD-WAN billings for the quarter were a high single-digit percentage of total billings. April billings continued this trend and the Q2 pipeline for secure SD-WAN is strong. And then, looking to customer segments, our G2000 billings increased 25%. SMB billings as a percentage of total billings increased slightly. Renewal rates remain within the guardrails that we provided at the Analyst Day.  And as a percentage of total billings, the worldwide retail segment remains one of our top 5 verticals and, as a percentage of total billings, remained unchanged year-over-year.  As our performance indicates, we did not see a material impact due to COVID-19 for the first quarter, and the second quarter is starting well. That said, there is a lot of uncertainty about future economic conditions.  Finally, I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter summarized on slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.  For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $700 million to $725 million, revenue in the range of $590 million to $605 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66 which assumes a share count of between 165 million and 167 million. We expected non-GAAP tax rate of 22%.  For 2020, due to the increased uncertainty associated with the economic impact from COVID-19, we believe the prudent thing to do is to withdraw our previously issued full-year guidance. Along with Ken, I would like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times.  Lastly, I also would like to invite all of you to listen to the management keynote presentations at our virtual Accelerate being held on May 12. You can contact Peter for registration link.  And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Peter. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Michelle, we're ready to do the Q&A if you can open up the lines for questions, please. Operator, are you there? Operator :  [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned that the June quarter \u2013 so, April is off to a fast start. Wondering, are you seeing the same products in high demand in April that you did in March? And do you think that that demand actually can continue perhaps into the back half or is this a temporary lift that you're saying? Ken Xie : I think pretty similar. Like we mentioned, we do see Fabric continue, especially work from home related, some are lower end. And also, like a FortiClient, Authenticator, FortiToken, still very strong. But, overall, I think it's the same. And also, the new product we introduced, both in the last quarter, the 1800F and also introduced the 4200F, see a very strong interest. I think so far we see pretty similar demand. Keith Jensen : Yeah. Sterling, I'd probably frame a response to add on to what Ken said by saying, obviously, we gave some insights in terms of what we were seeing in April. And as part of the guidance setting process, we would obviously normally look at what's your month one activity, what does your pipeline look for month two, and what does your pipeline look like in month three. So, I think you can assume that we've looked at those factors as part of setting the guidance for the second quarter. Ken Xie : Yeah. Also, a lot of feedback is really because our product has a good reputation. It's very cost efficient. The new one we announced and also the last few quarter, so have average VPN performance 10 times faster and had more capability compared to any other competitor that will be the secure competitor [indiscernible]. So, that's actually \u2013 a lot of company \u2013 a lot of enterprise, they usually have a work from home population, probably less than 10%. Now, they jumped over 90%. So, that's a huge demand for both headquarter, for office and also for some other work for home solution. So, that's where VPNs are very, very critical for all these enterprise. So, we see a lot of need for customer required solution compared to the other competitors. Sterling Auty : That makes sense. And then, the one follow-up would be, you mentioned 19% of revenue from the MSSP channel. I think investors always worried about that SMB exposure. Can you give us a sense of what you saw in terms of renewal rates in March and April, as well as just the demand pipeline from that segment? Ken Xie : Not actually. It's a very interesting area. We're also kind of a little bit surprised. Our overall SMB as a percentage of our business actually increased 1% to 2%, and that's where they grow faster than average. So, we kind of did some research. Probably there's two, three reasons. The first, whether the SMB or the work from home using network security as an endpoint seeing very, very low percentage, probably average only about like 5% or even low single digit. So, it's a very small percentage SMB work from home as a network security solution. So, that's where they may take this kind of opportunity to starting to kind of implement more work from home SMB solution.  The second one, we also believe whether \u2013 because SD-WAN or some other solution combined with both SD-WAN and Wi-Fi can also save a lot of cost, so we're cost efficient. So, that's where probably also the chance for customers to also using the new product.  And the third one, we do believe, if you look in last few quarters, we refreshed the low end first with all the F model. So, from like an 80F first almost three quarters ago, then 60F and then 40F we announced. It's all helping driving the SMB or work from home solution. So, maybe these two, three factors contribute SMB actually even grow faster than average. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you, guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from UBS. Fatima Boolani : Thank you for taking the questions. Ken, maybe to start with you, just on the SD-WAN momentum you're seeing, I think there's some confusion around how SD-WAN conflicts or is accretive to your branch office business. I'm wondering if you can just give us a sense of how SD-WAN is accretive to the overall branch footprint that you have. And as you think about the next 12 to 24 months, as branch office architectures do change, how do you think that would impact the lower-end SKUs you have in your portfolio? And then, I have a follow-up for Keith. Ken Xie : Yeah. Like I said in the script, so we are the only company internally developed SD-WAN and also built with security from very beginning. So, it's very cost-efficient and also combine multiple function together. So, that's where the customers see a lot of value. At the same time, like I said, somehow SMB or some other work from home still a low percentage of \u2013 that SMB also helping because the overall SD-WAN is still a relatively small market and grow very fast. So, we already become a top three and also grow the farthest one.  And then also, it's a little bit different offer than the other. Other probably only SD-WAN function, but we do company security with a lot of other functions inside our offering. At the same time, performance is much better because our own ASIC has a huge computing power advantage, handle multiple function at the same time. I think, overall, these all contribute both SMB and also \u2013 in fact, the FortiGate unit shipment grow 30%. That's also the highest one we see in the last few years. That's also probably \u2013 whether contribute to SD-WAN or contribute to work from home or SMB, it's pretty interesting and we still continue to see that in April. And so, we're still closely watching and also try to address any requirement from the customer to react quickly, both in SD-WAN and also for the SMB work from home solution.  Like I said, because we develop internally all this solution product, we can react much quicker compared with other competitors. They have to find a way to integrate, they have to \u2013 they have different SD-WAN, then the security, all the others. I think that gave us quite some advantage compared to other competitors. Fatima Boolani : That's super helpful. And, Keith, just for you, appreciate that color on the shipment volume and shipment trends in the quarter and in April. I'm wondering if you can characterize for us how much of that is maybe pulled-forward activity. If you can contextualize that with the pipeline for the rest of the year. Just wanted to get a sense of if there was actually rush buying or any accelerated buying activity. And that's it for me. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think any quarter, you've got puts and takes and that's kind of why we titled that section that way. There's some things that come in that maybe weren't in your commit to begin with that you weren't expecting, and there are some things that push out. I don't think that Q1 was really any different in any other way.  I think in terms of how we're looking at it in that regard, the purpose of providing some commentary about what we saw in April, which seemed to be contradictory to a thought that there was a bunch of pull-forward from Q2 into Q1 because April \u2013 we're happy with April. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Brian Essex : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And congratulations on the results in some pretty challenging economic times. I guess the first question, maybe for Ken, if I heard that right, you had some pretty strong financial services billings growth. Can you maybe comment on growth by vertical, where you saw maybe better strength in the quarter versus maybe some weakness? And it also seemed as though you actually did pretty well, surprising at the mid and entry-level range of your product spectrum. Any change anticipated for the rest of the year in terms of product release-driven activity versus maybe what might be more near-term work from home-driven expansion type sales? Ken Xie : Yeah. First the vertical \u2013 probably Keith later can help answer \u2013 is we still see service provider starting pretty strong and probably the fast-growing in the last few quarters, even few years. And also, the finance service, some governments actually also pretty strong. Retail, a little bit weak, but it's just a little bit. It's not as \u2013 I think it's still among the top five. Enterprise is probably still pretty okay. Especially the big enterprise, we see grow faster than the overall growth. It grew 25% for the top 2,000 enterprise. I think, going forward, we do see the new NP7 provide a lot of interest for big enterprise, especially work from home. They found out, suddenly, the workload, especially VPN, need almost 10x compared to before the pandemic. And a lot of competitor products cannot handle it anymore. So, we get a lot of requests from this enterprise IT, starting to see the advantage of our solution because we accelerate the VPN using ASIC, which on average, 10x better performance. So, that's actually \u2013 before maybe they not need that much VPN, but now they're starting to see, oh, that's a huge advantage which competitors cannot handle. So, we see very strong demand. And that's where the product we released today, the 4200F, and also last quarter 1800F, and also the previous middle high end, we're also starting to see pretty strong growth now. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think Ken did a very good job recapping the verticals. Just to kind of put a little more color on it, I think the government vertical, which for us is largely international, state and local, performed very well. We didn't need to call it out in the script, but it was clearly in the top three MSSPs. We talked about financial services. We talked about \u2013 as Ken indicated, retail was flattish year-over-year in terms of, I guess, percentage of billing. Tech had a pretty good quarter as well, but not enough to get it in the top five. Brian Essex : Got it. That's helpful. Maybe if I could hit one more quick one on SD-WAN. I had a lot of questions this quarter from investors just concerned about potential branch office closures. Did you see any change in the deployment of \u2013 within the branch office environment due to closures or maybe was it accelerated because of the closures and maybe better access to networks as a result? Maybe just a little quick color there would be helpful. Ken Xie : Yeah. I think we have a deployment we call a zero-touch deployment, and probably some IT, they leverage this opportunity to upgrade some infrastructure, whether at the branch office or \u2013 we don't see slowdown likely. We even see this accelerate a little bit. Brian Essex : Super helpful. Thank you so much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much. And congrats to you all for the strong momentum and being there for all of your constituents during these crazy times. Ken, I've got another SD-WAN question for you. One of your competitors recently made an acquisition in the SD-WAN space with plans to leverage their technology in a thin branch architecture. Can you maybe just help us by comparing and contrasting your approach to SD-WAN and whether one solution is inherently more cost-effective or has more efficacy? Thanks. Ken Xie : Yeah. We already spent like quite a long time developing SD-WAN, like 5 to 10 years. And so, from very beginning, combine that with the security together, so it can be used in security to decide how the SD-WAN function can be routed. So, that's very different than all the other major competitor, whether in the networking side or in the security side. They have to come from acquisition, which they have a lot of limitation, whether on a performance or combined networking function, security function together. So, that's the huge advantage we continue to enjoy.  At the same time, all this function is also ASIC accelerated, which kind of gave a 10x performance boost and also much lower total cost of ownership. So, that's how we see the benefit kind of more and more. And on the other side, SD-WAN can be part of the total solution, whether the cloud or infrastructure or the other part. Combined security SD-WAN together definitely have a huge advantage, whether easy to deploy or easy to manage a single pack solution. And at the same time, we also balance among how the cloud and how the edge computing working together, but some function needs to be processed in the cloud. That's also working well with a hybrid cloud approach. And also combined headquarter, the branch office, work from home, we found out is \u2013 that's also the Fabric keeping growth faster. And even a lot of product within the Fabric are suddenly double, triple than the previous quarter, like we mentioned about the FortiClient, FortiAuthenticator or FortiToken, it's all related to the work from home products suddenly see a huge increase. And so, the Fabric approach also we benefit a lot from that. Brad Zelnick : Thank you, Ken. That makes a lot of sense. And if I can just follow-up with you, Keith, how are you thinking about your hiring plans in light of the limited visibility you have? It actually seems like you're off to a pretty strong start in Q1. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think the hiring has been \u2013 we talked about this in the context over the last couple of quarters and the quarter, that within this balanced framework of profitability and growth that we're executing against, we thought coming into 2020 that we were going to tilt towards growth. And we think we saw that with some of the investments we made towards the end of last year, and we continue those hiring investments throughout the first quarter of this year. I think we'll start to lap some of those higher hiring percentages or growth in Q3 or Q4. And so, at that point in time, we'll start moving back in line with what we've seen historically. Brad Zelnick : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ongoing strong performance. You had a very solid European performance over the past few quarters. But I think specifically in the first quarter, some other companies have been reporting mixed-use mix outlook with respect to the European performance. What are you doing different or is it also driven by your strong partner relations in that region? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I probably look at this way. I think that when we say Europe, it also includes our emerging part of the business as well, emerging, meaning everything from Southern Africa up to the Middle East and into Eastern Europe. I think that latter component has been strong now for many quarters in a row. And yes, I do think that, one, it's great execution by that team. And I think also they do a very good job of how they, in some ways, are forced to go to market with that.  I think if you look at the quarter overall, we probably saw, as you would kind of expect with a pandemic, the US and the Americas probably outperformed Europe, Continental Europe a little bit more during the quarter, and that's kind of consistent with what we saw with the pandemic. Shaul Eyal : Got it. And Keith, while we have you, gross margins, also probably highest in recent quarters. What should we be expecting going forward? And what's been driving that little bit of an uptick that we had seen with gross margins, specifically for the company, which is slightly more appliance-driven? Keith Jensen : I think the guidance that we provided for gross margin is good for the quarter. I feel comfortable with that. I do think that we're benefiting as our cost structure changed a little bit with some of our newer products. And I think that we're partnering perhaps a little bit more effectively with our channel partners over the last couple of years than we had in the past. Shaul Eyal : Good job. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Melissa Franchi from Morgan Stanley. Melissa Franchi : Thank you very much for taking my question. I want to go back to the discussion on the branch business. I think investors are trying to understand what the trajectory looks like for the branch, just given some exposure to economically-sensitive verticals like retail. So, I know that it's probably pretty early, but as you look into your pipeline, are you anticipating any change in terms of renewal rates for the branch? And I know that April is shaping up to be pretty well, but what should we expect for the second half of the year? Keith Jensen : So, we didn't guide to the second half of the year. And we don't give a lot of specifics on renewal rates, but I think I made a comment that what we saw in the first quarter was that renewal rates were within that band that we provided at the Analyst Day. And I really don't see that changing based upon what I'm seeing. I think it's probably helpful to kind of consider the context of our diversification. And I kind of made reference to it just a moment ago when I talked about the US performed very strongly and Europe was probably hit by the pandemic a little bit harder.  You're talking about a company now that's less than 30% of its business is in the US and there may be a lot of focus on retail headlines in the US, but it's probably passing over perhaps the recovery that's already started in Europe and the impact from Latin America and other geographies. Melissa Franchi : Okay, that's very helpful. And just following up with you, Keith. I'm wondering if you could just maybe give a little bit more color on some of your underlying assumptions for the Q2 guide. I know April seems to be pretty healthy so far, but are you assuming that continues through the rest of the quarter or are you expecting a more challenging close? Thank you. Keith Jensen : I think we feel very good about the business, about the products, about the strategy that we're executing, about the sales team's ability to execute, about our ability to support our customers and the ability to support our partners.  And with that in mind, I'm looking at the pipeline, I'm looking at the slicing and the dicing of the pipeline. As I kind of made reference a moment ago, I'm looking at different assumptions for different geographies based upon the status of the pandemic in those geographies. We're looking at deal sizes. Larger deals have typically more risk than smaller deals do as part of our assessment. We look at whether or not it's a new logo or an existing customer or a renewal. So, all those things go into the mix in terms of setting the guidance for the quarter. Melissa Franchi : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Hey, Ken. Maybe first for you, a lot of questions on the branch and understandably so, but maybe even just thinking about the enterprise, how do you think your enterprise customers are thinking about their VPN strategies longer-term and how do you sort of expect Fortinet to play into that? Ken Xie : I think this pandemic probably changing some of the working patterns. Like I said before, there is probably less than 10% people work remotely, access on VPN. Now due to this lockdown, probably, we see over 90%. Maybe if even we go back, reopen, whatever, maybe still 30%, 50% and it all depends on the vertical. So, that's making this remote access work from home starting to get more and more important, and especially the networking need to be combined with endpoint. Endpoint sometimes, you can address certain device. But if you are on the network side, you can actually secure the whole branch or the whole home and whatever that was there. And even different like, with Wi-Fi, [indiscernible] like different member of the family can kind of manage all these different bandwidths. We see this enterprise headquarter office VPN starting to have a pretty strong demand there. And some other like authenticated products, some other products \u2013 Fabric, we also see pretty good growth. Actually, even double, triple some of these different component of Fabric. Saket Kalia : Got it. That's very helpful. Maybe as my follow-up for you, Keith. Or maybe can you comment on any trends in the FortiGuard bundles as a result of increased work from home? I know you talked about some of the trends in FortiCare with that nice uptick in customers opting for 24/7. But curious if you've seen any material shifts in the makeup of FortiGuard subscription with the different bundles that you have as a result of work from home? Keith Jensen : No, no. Not really. Saket Kalia : Okay, got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Keith Jensen : Rob, are you there? Saket Kalia : Hi. Can you hear me? Keith Jensen : We can. Saket Kalia : Okay. Sorry about that. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, your ability to directly manage supply chain and shipping logistics. And I'm curious, as you look forward towards the second quarter and should you still see strong surge in demand around the FortiGate solutions, any supply chain concerns or are those all relatively put to bed at this time? Keith Jensen : I think I feel good about it, but the head of manufacturing has some work to do. Ken Xie : Again, so far, we don't see any issue. We see it pretty good. They also would recover pretty quick in not only the supply chain, but also we manage our own shipment, shipping logistics and also our own supporting. So, we're not outsourcing any shipment or customer supporting. That's also with all these facility, with all the team, we can quickly address why and can make it more like redundant or whatever, resistant to any kind of downside to adopt quickly. Keith Jensen : We still have a spot or two of components that may be lined up in Japan or the Philippines or Malaysia or something like that on an individual component. But keep in mind, part of our business model is looking at our inventory turns, which have been less than 3 recently. So, really, that means we're carrying about four months of inventory at any point in time.  And even at that level, we weren't at 100% execution, even though the backlog was consistent with other quarters. And so, probably, we're looking at our inventory level and thinking maybe as we go through the next quarter or two to move that up just ever so slightly as we start transitioning to further guard against this possible risk for pandemic. Saket Kalia : I appreciate the color. And then, just briefly, if I may, I know there's been a lot of discussions around work from home, branch office, but where do you guys come down as you're talking to customers on kind of that cloud, SASE arguments? And strategically, as people are considering work from home, what's kind of been the response of customers as they're looking at your solution versus others? Ken Xie : Like I said a few weeks ago, we feel the SASE, the best model is really working with a service provider. Like today, this morning, we also announced a partnership with NTT West, offer all these like whether work from home or kind of a [indiscernible] service provider solution for both SD-WAN and also security. And even ourselves, we do have the technology, but we do believe this cloud approach need to be working with edge and on-premise together. So, we have the structure. It's all in the testing and also working with a lot of service provider right now, because the Forti SASE approach is a little bit different than the traditional SASE approach, which they forward all the traffic, whether from endpoint to your device from home and also in the office to the cloud.  So, we believe the better approach for the SASE, we call Forti SASE, is for the endpoint of some work from home, your mobile device maybe makes sense to forward to the cloud to process, which we have all the solution. But when in the office, your forward office traffic to the cloud does not quite make sense. It's not very secure, because when you forward, it's not quite encrypted. And also, it increases a lot of network traffic and much high latency, much slow.  And most of these SASE companies, very interestingly, more leveraged, like whether open source of freeware to do the security. So, when you do the testing of the security, their security [indiscernible] not as good as some other dedicated security company because we have a few hundred people just doing all this intelligent research and has done this for 20 years. So, that's where from better security, better networking latency and better like cost-wise.  Some offers, probably if you using on-site premise, more like [indiscernible] solution to process a lot of traffic locally will be much better than forward all this office traffic to the cloud. So, that's where we have \u2013 it's a Forti SASE, but a little bit different. And also, when we're working with service providers, we also make \u2013 it's a profit model compared to a lot of other SASE company. They have to invest a lot of proper data center, which is making them keeping losing money. Eventually, all this service provider, they do have their own kind of own infrastructure. So, with their current infrastructure, they leverage what they can process on-site and in office will be much more secure and cost effectively to solve this issue, right, whether it is management or manage all this mobile security solution. So, that's where we have a little bit different approach. More leverage of service provider and also leverage both on the cloud and also on-premise on edge solutions.  So, I think that's kind of very, very good feedback from all this, both in the enterprise side, in the service provider, also in the customer. So, we feel that will be the right approach. Saket Kalia : Thanks for the color. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Michael Turits : You commented that, in the quarter, you got strong demand for VPN, authentication, token, endpoint, all clearly work from home driven, and you are seeing those same trends so far into April. The question is, do you have some feel for where we are in terms of customers getting up to the level of capacity they need in terms of that product? Is that a 2Q finish or does it extend further? Michael Turits : Well, like I said, whether the SMB or work for home, still very low percentage. Probably US, maybe around 5%. Some other region, country, even lower than that. So, it's still huge potential on whether SMB or work or home. And then, when you try to access to home, to the office, suddenly, you need a huge increase, almost 10x increase on the headquarter or whatever the office VPN need supporting all this home worker, remote worker.  And then, at the same time, you also need a secure solution in the other side, whether from home or the device level authenticator. So, that's where we see quite strong demand there. Michael Turits : Keith, I don't know if you have anything to add to that, but my follow-up question for you is about payment terms. I think you commented that duration was about 25 months on invoicing. Just remind us where it was and if you have any concern about that shortening. And you talked about 15% extension in payment terms. Again, any concern about that in terms of your need to help out customers and the impact of either one of those on cash flow. Keith Jensen : Well, look, I think the headline would be that we have a strong balance sheet and we're certainly going to leverage our balance sheet where there's opportunities to gain market share and to support our customers and our channel partners. There's no real doubt about that in my mind. We don't guide to free cash flow, but there's probably some adjustment that you want to make to your free cash flow model for the second quarter because I do think that Fortinet is in a position to help others. And I expect us to use our balance sheet to do that on a case-by-case basis. Michael Turits : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. Two questions. One, I guess, for Ken. Just around the low end of the product line looked pretty strong. I'm wondering how strong of a trend it was that you saw actual work from home customers taking low end boxes and that being part of what you shipped, understanding that FortiClient was strong and the Token, Authenticator products and so forth. Just wondering how much that contributed on the appliance side. Ken Xie : I think they're both pretty strong. The FortiClient probably even double, triple, but come from relatively small base. And then, the appliance, the low end, whether SMB or some work from home, also pretty strong. Like, if you see, the unit shipment increased 30%. That's mostly contributed from the low end because the high end, middle range will not impact that much of the unit shipment. I think the trend still, like I said, is still in the \u2013 we still get a lot of enterprise and also they see \u2013 the current, whether the competitor's product cannot handle suddenly the huge increase of the VPN or some other work-for-home solution. So we get a lot of interest. And so, IT guy also super busy, try to \u2013 whether do the deployment or whatever. And at the same time, we also try to help them supporting them and we have this called zero-touch deployment, help them to deploy whether the branch or some other headquarter solution quickly to meet all this strong demand. I don't see the trend slow down yet. But even after the pandemic, we do see the percentage of people starting work from home probably will be higher, maybe like a few times higher compared to before the pandemic. Keith Jensen : It's Keith. I'll just to add to that. I think the model, so to speak, that you're more likely to see is that when people start working from home, it's not that they're going home and taking a firewall with them. I think they're installing FortiClients on their laptop. So, that's probably really not going to drive a low end business by itself.  On the other side of the corporate IT organization, now they're trying to \u2013 they need greater throughput and greater capacity because of things like VPN and authentication and so forth. And so, you may see the corporate buyer is actually moving up, if you will, in terms of what they're buying. But, again, it's not firewall for the home.  I think the other aspect of it is, we have a new product called the 60F, which was a real beast in the quarter just in terms of the volumes that it produced. And then, in our favor, it has a little bit different cost structure than its predecessor. So, it's giving us a little bit of lift on margins. Ken Xie : I think it's also interesting really, the FortiClient probably can load on your laptop or your mobile, but that only secure one device. So, when you work from home, you're also probably competing with your kids for the bandwidth and then also some other things you need to manage together, some other appliance, could be like how this remote monitor device, all these things. That's where the FortiGate come in. It's very, very handy. Very, very good solution. So, they can manage different device from different load of bandwidths, secure Wi-Fi together and even some \u2013 I'm not sure how much use total SD-WAN, but it's still \u2013 but it's really the product offers so much function. They can have the whole house being managed much better secure, much better compared to one device. So, that's making them work from home as a much better security and also can kind of \u2013 it's much better than just one device. Walter Pritchard : And then, Keith, just on the guidance, understanding we're seeing lots of companies pull the guidance because of the unprecedented times. I'm just wondering, if you look at your forecast and think about 90 days from now, what sort of things are you looking for in your forecasting to be able to get back to giving annual guidance? Specifically, what sort of things are unstable there or sort of too wide of a range to be able to call at this point that you'll be watching? Keith Jensen : Like everybody else, I think our concerns or our interests are, is there going to be a second wave? What's the severity of the second wave going to be? What geography is it going to hit? And when is it going to hit in those geographies? And really, ultimately, what economy are you trying to provide guidance into? And that's just the unknown right now in the second half of the year. Walter Pritchard : Okay, thank you. Understandable. Operator : And your next question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Daniel Bartus : This is Dan Bartus on for Tal. I was just wondering if you can share some thoughts on overall security budgets and how you think they might trend this year. Curious if you're hearing from any customers that they're looking to already cut back maybe in 2Q or second half.  And then, just a quick follow-up for Keith, probably. Can you just help us think about how much of your SD-WAN business is driven by MSPs and MSSPs? Ken Xie : I think from the [indiscernible] 2007, 2008, security budgets hold pretty well during this recession. But this time it's different. And that's where we also try to be very careful for any guidance. And so far, we see in the first quarter, also in April, we see pretty good and low impact, no any material impact. And if since not get worse, we feel pretty comfortable. But like Keith said, these times are different. We try to be very careful. Keith Jensen : I think in terms of the SD-WAN and the MSSPs, I would characterize that as being a market that we're very interested in because it's a very large market. Obviously, the MSSPs have already come to it with an incumbent that we're trying to displace. But that opportunity, without quantifying it, if you will, is something that I would say we're very focused on internally. Daniel Bartus : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. I guess, first off, you guys have seen fairly impressive share gains over the last couple of years. I'm wondering how do you think the share gains stack up over the next few years as we go through a recession effectively. Do you think share gains can actually accelerate given the TCO proposition that you guys have in enterprises or is that unlikely to happen given no one probably wants to replace legacy gear at this point? Ken Xie : We probably continue to leverage the strong technology product, whether leverage, we call the SPU, security process unit, and ASIC which gave a huge performance advantage and is a VPN function or quite a broad function and also the fabric approach, which is already 20, 30 product or most internally developed, working, integrate, automate together, which not a competitor have this advantage. And at the same time, we'll continue to invest. We're continuing to hire, but also we found that it's more easy to hire some high-quality people and we will continue to \u2013 and the other part also, we found we probably have the biggest training program in this whole cybersecurity industry. And we started to open up outlets for free. And not only are we working with a few hundred university to train out the student, but also a lot of big enterprise, a lot of service provider, a lot of our work on home user, all starting see a huge need for the training.  Actually, we found that we set a new registration every few second. So, every few seconds, we get a new registration set up for the training and it's a huge benefit because, in this security space, it's \u2013 last year, there's a 3.5 million shortage of trained people to help in handle the security. So, that's also the opportunity we found out to train people and then recruit them also quickly and help us solve the whole industry problem.  So, we see this as a huge opportunity for us based on the big investment we made before and also where we continued working very hard with all the team and all the partners, all the customers try to make the whole Internet more secure. Keith Jensen : I think there's three things that Ken's making a point or making reference of, and I'd probably summarize them this way. I think these three things are working in our favor at the moment. One is our fabric product set has continued to expand and has continued to mature and become even more competitive, if you will, in terms of features and functions with some of the best of breed.  You are seeing more and more customers, at least those that I'm talking to, and prospects, much more interested now in a platform approach that enables automation and integration and moving away from a best-of-breed solution for every aspect of the security platform.  And then, the third aspect of it, we are probably moving into an environment where cost effectiveness is a premium in your go-to-market messaging. By that, if you can argue that successfully and produce that and deliver that lower cost, more cost-effective option, you can be successful in this market. Amit Daryanani : That's really helpful, guys. And then, Keith, a quick one for you. You talked about average contractual terms pushing out about 15%. What's the impact of that and what's the best way for us to read that statement? Keith Jensen : It's payment terms, not the length of the contract, right? And I mentioned that it was slightly less than 15% increase, if you will. And I would probably think you just want to take a little bit of second looking at what your cash collection assumptions are in your free cash flow model for Q2. Amit Daryanani : Got it, thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back over to Peter Salkowski, Vice President, Investor Relations. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Michelle.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Peter Salkowski. Thank you, and please go ahead, sir. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet, and I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the second quarter, provide some additional details regarding our second quarter performance and some insights into how July performed before providing guidance for the third quarter of 2020. We'll then open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today's call are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our second quarter 2020 results. We are very pleased with the solid second quarter performance. Revenue increased 18% to $616 million, with product revenue up 12% and service revenue up 22%. Secure SD-WAN climbed to 12% of total second quarter billings, the first time it's been over 10%. In today's environment, enterprise are focused on effectively and cost efficiently deploying security across their physical and digital network. To meet these challenges, Fortinet was founded on the vision of bringing security and networking together in what we refer to as security-driven networking. Gartner supports a similar concept, which they call Secure Access Service Edge or SASE. Fortinet is an industry leader in building, integrating and automating security product and service into Fortinet Security Fabric, including FortiSASE. With the recent acquisition of OPAQ Networks, Fortinet has enhanced its FortiSASE solution with expanded cloud delivery, including firewall as a service and Zero-Trust Network Access. Additionally, FortiSASE was built to be partner-friendly empowering MSPs and big global customers to easily integrate or build FortiSASE platform into their own offerings. A critical component of Fortinet Security Fabric platform is SD-WAN. We recently announced the new FortiGate 80F, which expand our SD-WAN portfolio for branch offices and work-from-home. The FortiGate 80F is powered by the latest FortiSPU SoC4 can deliver Security Compute Rating as much as 25x higher than industry average appliance using generic CPUs. According to Gartner, worldwide SD-WAN equipment market data for the first quarter of 2020, Fortinet has the highest revenue growth and was the top 3 for market share. We attribute this growth to our ability to deliver secure, high-performance SD-WAN anywhere from home to the branch to the cloud. Security investment remains a priority for enterprise and service providers, demonstrated by the strong growth of our high-end FortiGate appliance during the last quarter. Today, we released the FortiGate 4400F, the only firewall in the industry capable of securing hyperscale data center and 5G networks. Powered by the NP7 network processor, the 4400F delivers the highest performance with Security Compute Rating of up to 13x higher than our competition. The release of several new appliance powered by our latest FortiASIC SPU, together with cloud and software-based virtual machine to deploy security anywhere, we are able for Fortinet to capitalize on this investment and put us in a strong position going forward. Before turning the call over to Keith for a closer look at our second quarter performance and our guidance, I would like to take a moment to welcome the over 400 people who joined Fortinet during the second quarter as well as welcome OPAQ team who recently joined, and to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continued support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Let's start the second quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $616 million was up 18%, driven by non-FortiGate products and service revenue growth of 25%. Non-FortiGate revenue growth benefited from very strong demand for virtual machines and our work-from-home solutions. FortiGate product and service revenue growth was 16% and benefited from record levels of billings for our secure SD-WAN solution. To a large extent, our second quarter revenue growth, together with the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, affirms the benefits of our diversification across geographies, customer segments and industry verticals. At the same time, it illustrates the level of revenue predictability in our business model. Our continued growth in this environment is a result of our strategic internal investments made to expand our global sales force, invest in our channel partners and extend our cost per performance advantage as we update our product offerings and penetrate adjacent security markets. Product revenue grew 12% to $212 million -- excuse me, $212 million, benefiting from strong demand for secure SD-WAN, high-end FortiGates and FortiGate virtual machines. Our work-from-home solutions continue to provide a tailwind to growth. Our growth rates and industry reports suggest we continue to take market share in both the firewall and SD-WAN markets, markets where we have contributed leadership and innovation. Moving to service revenue. Service revenue grew 22% to $404 million, representing 66% of total revenue. Over 90% of service revenue was from deferred revenue at the beginning of the quarter and continues to support our revenue growth and predictability. FortiGuard security subscriptions revenue increased 22% to $223 million. FortiCare technical support revenue increased 22% to $181 million. The revenue mix shift from 8/5 support to our higher-priced 24/7 support was 9 points, with 24/7 support now representing 64% of the mix.  Let's shift to billings. Total billings increased 14% to $711 million. The total billing growth was negatively impacted by approximately 2 points by training and professional services and other miscellaneous products, which are products not classified as FortiGate, fabric or cloud. Earlier this year, we announced our decision to make our network security expert, or NSE, online training and certification program free to the public. While this decision resulted in a reduction in training billings and training revenue, we're very excited about the demand we are seeing with our NSE training. As of this week, the number of NSE registrations for 2020 is well over 500,000. And the number of NSE certifications issued is up over 200% to nearly 200,000.  Looking at billings by product segment. FortiGate billings increased 14% and accounted for 73% of total billings. FortiGate billings include our secure SD-WAN solutions. And as Ken mentioned a moment ago, SD-WAN passed over the 10% threshold for the first time ever, representing 12% of total billings. Non-FortiGate billings also increased 14%, with strong demand from our virtual and work-from-home solutions, offset by smaller contributions from switches and access points. And as I mentioned, billing declines for professional services, training and other miscellaneous products. Our geographic performance aligned with a path of the pandemic. And with it, highlighted the geographic diversification of our business, APAC being further along, outperformed all geos, followed by Europe while North America was impacted more. Our North America results include the United States, where we saw headwinds from the education and local government verticals where the COVID-19 pandemic remained an issue. By comparison, the retail segment was by far and away the strongest-performing U.S. vertical with growth well over 40% as we saw the continued expansion of the SD-WAN solution. The U.S. SMB segment provided strong growth, illustrating the strength of our U.S. channel programs, the remaining opportunity in this market and solid execution by our channel partners and the Fortinet channel team. Looking more at the Americas, our analysis and discussions with our channel partners suggest that certain transactions were delayed into the second half of this year as these companies focused on their capital structure and other immediate priorities.  Moving now to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The diversification of our business model was again on display with our top 5 verticals continue to account for about 2/3 of total billings. Worldwide government sector topped all verticals with 19% of total billings. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 15% of total billings. Financial services with 14% of total billings had a very strong quarter with billings growth of 33%. And despite COVID-related concerns, the retail vertical posted worldwide billings growth of 27%, accounting for 10% of billings as it continued to benefit from SD-WAN and the strong U.S. performance I mentioned a moment ago. We saw strong growth in retail sub-verticals, such as drug stores, groceries and portions of the wholesale industry. At the end of the second quarter, total deferred revenue increased 24% to $2.3 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 24% to $1.3 billion.  Looking now at deals by dollar size. The number of deals over $1 million increased 28% to 59%. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 13 of these deals over $1 million. This performance illustrates our continued ability to move upmarket into the enterprise segment and the continued acceptance of our differentiated single unit, secure SD-WAN offering. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, gross margin improved 260 basis points to 79%. Product gross margin improved 340 basis points to 61%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from the lower cost structure of our newer generation of FortiGate products and over 40% growth in software products. Services gross margin increased 120 basis points to 88.5%, reflecting the benefit of the FortiCare revenue mix shift to 24/7 support. Operating margin for the second quarter increased 370 basis points to 27.3%, benefiting from the improvement in gross margin and lower employee travel and marketing program expenses related to the shift towards virtual events.  Total head count ended the quarter at 7,756, an increase of 23%, driven by the increased investments we've made to grow our business and reflecting a continued decline in sales and other attrition rates. With our continued growth, strong operating margins and free cash flow, we do not anticipate any COVID-19-related layoffs in the foreseeable future. In fact, we plan to capitalize on our many opportunities by continuing to hire and invest in our balanced growth strategy. Given the strong operating income performance, net income for the second quarter was $135 million. Our earnings per diluted share increased $0.24 to $0.82 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $112 million or $0.68 per diluted share versus GAAP income of $73 million or $0.42 per diluted share a year ago.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow increased 21.5% to $216 million. The average contract term in the second quarter continued to be within the range we provided at the Analyst Day, declining 1 month year-over-year to 26 months and moving up 1 month sequentially. As we stated on the first quarter call, we expected to leverage the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and our customers. Average contractual payment terms increased to 62 days or 17% sequentially, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment term plans. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $31 million, including $21 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the third quarter to be between $50 million and $60 million and for all of 2020 to be between $165 million and $185 million. Delays related to the new campus building have moved a portion of the previously expected 2020 CapEx spending into the first half of 2021. We expect full year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million, and our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 22%. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $146 million. In July, the Board authorized an additional $500 million for our share repurchase authorization and extended the term to February 2022. As of today, the remaining share buyback authorization is approximately $1 billion.  Before moving to guidance, we wanted to offer some additional thoughts related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have and we plan to continue leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, which may increase DSOs and inventory levels. The economic and business impact of the pandemic seems in line with the ability of different countries and geographies to reopen and avoid temporary shutdowns and uncertainty. For example, after strong billings growth in April, we saw slower growth as we completed May, then followed by a bounce back to strong growth in June and again strong in July. At the same time, the remaining Q3 pipeline points to a good level of improvement in both the U.S. and worldwide. In the second quarter, our channel partners reported some deals being delayed into the second half of the year. The concept was delayed, not lost, seems supported by the increases in our pipeline as well as with July selling activity. Clearly, there remains an elevated level of uncertainty about future -- about future pandemic events and economic conditions. As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the third quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. In the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $705 million to $730 million; revenue in the range of $630 million to $645 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 79%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.78, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. For 2020, due to the continued uncertainty associated with the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not issuing full year guidance at this time.  And finally, along with Ken, I'd like to welcome all the team members who have joined us, including the OPAQ team. I'd also like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Chris, we would like to open the line for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Robbie Owens : I want to start on the SD-WAN side of things and the success that you're obviously seeing there through the metrics now over 10% of billings. But just what that pipeline looks like. Have you seen more of a rush given COVID work-from-home and the opportunity to replace a lot of these conditions relative to branch types of solutions? Or are you seeing as much of robust demand, I guess, in that forward pipe? Ken Xie : I think it's SD-WAN is a long-term benefit for both enterprise and also SMB and because it's also lower the cost of connect to the Internet. At the same time, make it more efficient. And for us, also building with ASIC security together, so they can also have additional secured additional benefit and cost much lower compared to some other competitors. So the market grew about 50% year-over-year. So we see a lot of potential, a lot of pipeline. We do believe we're keep on gaining market share because our solution is a very unique, huge advantage compared to other competitors. And with additional sales capacity we added, like we add head count, 23%. Even during the pandemic, take a little bit more time to train the new sales people, and then they maybe take a little bit more time to gain a new customer, but we do see a huge potential going forward. Robbie Owens : And then secondarily, I guess, focusing on the SASE opportunity and some of the dialogues on previous calls, maybe you could touch on the OPAQ acquisition. Was this customer driven? Was this opportunistic from your perspective, offensive, defensive? Ken Xie : We have this FortiSASE, like I mentioned, even in the last time earnings call, and we do believe it's a part of the whole infrastructure. So as the cloud delivery, we already have some other cloud delivery, but OPAQ definitely keep enhances, and we're making more broad, more flexible for customer, for the partner to leverage the product infrastructure we're building. And so we do see this already and hence, the offer we have. And at the same time, we do have the broadest offering both on the platform and also on the function and also on kind of different form of deployment compared to other competitors we see is keeping ahead our position. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Fatima Boolani : Maybe a bigger picture question for you. The combination of SD-WAN adoption in a more durable work-from-home environment -- maybe as giving investors the sense and perhaps it's misplaced. But giving investors a sense that the traditional enterprise branch office is potentially at risk from either a refreshed footprint perspective and a cannibalization perspective. So I'm wondering if you can help us parse through sort of some of the puts and takes as to what happens to your branch office footprint and what some of those misconceptions might be as customers adopt SD-WAN and or stay at home more permanently in shelter in place situation? And then I have a follow-up for Keith. Ken Xie : The enterprise also, including some branch profits we do see some slowdown especially in the U.S. But it's -- on the other side, if you look at our product, which come out like the SoC4 come out 1 years ago, we started building a product like from 100F to 60F for the 40F, then we just announced 80F last week. So we can see the ramp-up, especially in the SMB, including the U.S., as it go up like over 40%. It's very, very strong. Internationally, we're a little bit behind on the U.S. to adopt some new products, including some -- both the low end using SoC4 and also the high end NP7, which is starting to release about like early this year and so starting to ramp up. So that's why we see the benefit of the new product, which easily have a performance like 4x, 5x better than the same cost, which we use in the - - we call security compute rating to benchmark compared to the other competitor is a huge advantage. So we see -- when we have the new product growth that come up very quickly after the testing evaluate on top of the product. But on the other side, the SD-WAN also gave the additional cost benefit, together with the new product cost performance benefit. So that's what helping driving the SMBs. We see it starting growing quite well. Also last quarter, after we announced the high end product, like 1 to 2 quarter, we starting to see the high end also starting to ramp up leverage NP7. So that's the trend. And I do believe sometime enterprise takes a little bit more time during this pandemic to do some deployment. But we do see a lot of evaluation going on. We do see some other interest, including combined, we call security networking together, we call secure-driven networking set the whole infrastructure. That's why the sales probably were more engage into the networking team. And also traditionally, more sales to security. Now as the networking team also starting engaged together with us to call secure-driven networking. So as we see the trend going on quite well. And also, like Keith mentioned, it's region by region, right? So it's a APAC staring to grow more very quickly, over 20%. And simply the pandemic kind of the situation maybe better recover a little bit better. And then we also see Europe probably also growing over 10%. The U.S. is a little bit slow, but we do believe later this year, next year that vaccines over, with the new product lineup, with the additional sales capacity we build, which we'll continue to invest, where we see very, very strong potential going forward. Keith Jensen : Yes, Fatima This is Keith. I think Ken does a great job of covering off some of the diversification considerations, whether it's by geographies and where different geographies may be and also by verticals. But it's also important to note that SD-WAN is also a significant component of SASE also for work-from-home solutions. Fatima Boolani : Fair enough. And Keith, since I have you, any comments on the billings performance, specifically this quarter? And just double-clicking in Q4 to get gate billings because that includes both your traditional sort of network security perimeter security and the secure SD-WAN piece. I'm wondering if you can kind of qualitatively talk to sort of what drove the bus this quarter and how you're thinking about the secure SD-WAN versus non-secure SD-WAN, Fortigate pipeline for the remainder of the year and what's baked into your 3Q guidance? And that's it for me. Keith Jensen : A lot of topics, Fatima. Maybe I'll start with the last one in. Fatima Boolani : I tried. Keith Jensen : I know you do a good job. Look, I think when we look at the pipeline for Q3, which is what we've guided to, I think we feel very good about the SD-WAN opportunity. Clearly, we saw it perhaps, in the U.S. in the month of May a bit of a pause, maybe some projects that were -- as we got towards the end of May. But clearly, as we exited Q2 and we've moved into Q3, we can see that our customers are making plans to continue moving forward their SD-WAN build-outs. And the additional opportunities that we see in the pipeline made us, let's just say, comfortable talking about crossing over that 10% threshold for the first time. Now we'll see how it actually comes into play. And I think I lost track of some of your earlier comments, I'm sorry. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Shaul Eyal : Congrats on the quarter. Keith or Ken. So U.S. was the fastest region this quarter. Next week, we'll mark the middle of the quarter, the third quarter. Can you talk to us about the performance so far within the U.S.? What's the pipeline is looking like? Ken Xie : We do see some enterprise customer has a good interest about SASE and just like some other cloud or some other platform of deployment infrastructure. So that when we make it as the whole infrastructure security offering. And the dollar or the amount of revenue are still relatively small, which may not impact much of the total billing of revenue there, but there's an interest about this and make it -- so customer want us make sure has some kind of flexibility and also broad offering. So that's where we see the OPAQ acquisition keep enhance what we have on the FortiSASE and also offer more broad, both on the product and the deployment on the infrastructure side to meet customer demand. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I would add to Ken's comment. Just pulling back and looking at it even maybe a little more broadly and to the comments that were made in the prepared remarks, we were very pleased with what we saw in terms of July selling activity and the pipeline build worldwide as well as in the U.S. Ken Xie : Yes. At the same time, like we said, we're also keep on supporting our partner, including the service provider and even some big global customers, they also want to build in their own SASE to just like the cloud. Sometimes they have the private cloud or the leverage public cloud or the hybrid cloud. So it's a similar thing we're seeing here in SASE, which we're also supporting the partner, the customer try to have their own version of SASE, which is based on the service of zero-trust infrastructure to deploy some security function. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : You mentioned continued tailwinds from work-from-home, but we have seen the growth rate on the product side and to a certain extent, the billings ex the adjustments you mentioned start to fade. So I guess my question is, do you expect that those trends can continue on for multiple more quarters? Or do we face further deceleration in the back half as some of the work-from-home tailwinds fade further? Ken Xie : We do see the enterprise service provider, the high end continue to grow maybe because the new product is announced early this year. And also some SMB, some other part also have very healthy growth. And also, even some of the product target for work-from-home continue to grow in, like we mentioned, FortiToken, FortiAuthenticator and some other products. So it's probably not as a rush buy like we're experiencing some back in March, but it's still pretty strong above the total network security growth. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then one follow-up. We've heard from multiple companies about accelerating digital transformations. How did the digital transformations and shift to the cloud impact your business either positively or otherwise? Ken Xie : Yes, we see pretty strong in the retail, right? So if retail, they can order online, they can do whatever deliver or some other -- definitely, they have a lot of benefit. So that's where we see very strong growth in retail, probably benefit from the digitalization and some other vertical or even some other regions have a sort of similar sense. And especially, we said that's what we call the security-driven networking, its combined security networking together. And even the sales, traditionally, they're more engaged with the security team. Now they see a lot of interest from the networking team, partially because SD-WAN is part of FortiGate function, but other party do see it needs to into the networking and security working together, whether the [indiscernible] or the SoC combined together, is also a trend there. So that's where we see quite a good progress combined the security network together, which we designed from our beginning, not just SD-WAN, including Wi-Fi. But Wi-Fi a little bit slow right now because especially enterprise offered in the office, not many people work in the office, but we do see a lot of interest continuing in that direction. And also the 5G, we see very, strong increase in ramp up. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Brian Essex : Keith, I was wondering maybe if you could hit a little bit more on billings, maybe a little bit softer than we had expected in the quarter and then kind of a nice guidance for next quarter. Maybe some of the dynamics behind that. And in particular, I'm interested in large deal dynamics, particularly U.S. financial services, where we've heard about some weakness in the quarter. I understand retail is really strong, but maybe a little bit more color on that and how it might impact billings. Keith Jensen : I think the financial services strength that we saw in the quarter was outside of the U.S. Obviously, New York got hit. Northeast got hit pretty hard with the pandemic in the second quarter. And so that financial services growth number that we gave on billings, I think, it was 33%. That's really an international growth number, and it kind of speaks to the diversification of the business. And we've talked before about our diversification that the U.S. represents maybe 25% to 30%. Obviously, our largest country, but not a majority as it is with some other businesses. So we did feel the effect, particularly towards the middle part of the quarter there with some of the things that were happening and the uncertainty in the U.S. on our total numbers, but we are very pleased with what we saw, as I said earlier, related to Asia Pacific and the rest of the world. Ken Xie : Yes. The other part, really, starting to make the second half of last year, we started in May, the second half of last year we started to ramp up the high-end ad sales capacity, additional market in lead gen -- and then the pandemic actually slowed down some of the new sales, I mean, become like more productive or whatever reach the productivity level for what we expect. At the same time, some of them maybe take a little bit longer time to reach the new customer, especially in the U.S., we do have quite some sales capacity. That's actually the pandemic slow since down a little bit, but with the additional hiring, with additional new product position we have, we do believe once the pandemic starting to get better, especially in the U.S., we will see very strong growth potential. Brian Essex : Got it. Maybe, Keith, just a quick follow-up quickly. Nice cut in cash flow in the quarter, better than we thought. Maybe some of the puts and takes outside of billings and change in deferred that drove that and outlook for the rest of the year from -- particularly from a working capital perspective. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the other part of it is that collections are very strong, and I applaud the collections team for the great job that they did, working with our channel partners to bring the cash in. I think we were perhaps a little more successful in that than we planned. Yes. I think when you look at our free cash flow numbers, you're going to get from quarter-to-quarter a little bit of volatility because we try not to over manage the timing of payments and things of that nature. So it's probably better to look at a couple of quarters stringing those together to look at terms. But in terms of the key drivers, yes, it's billings. You can get something with inventory and payables. But I think the margin part of that really is a large driver. That outperformance on the margin line really manifests itself in many ways, one of which is in the free cash flow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Hamza Fodderwala : Keith, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the comments that you made around some of the sales cycles towards the end of the quarter. I'm wondering if how did those deal cycles progress toward late in Q2. What, if any, deals sort of had slipped out in Q3? And whether or not those have been closed so far in July? Keith Jensen : Yes, fair question. And I think the thing that we've seen with the pandemic, and I'll pull this up a little bit, if you go through the guidance setting process, obviously, you'll start with the pipeline, and then you start making certain assumptions about the close rate. And while we felt good, I felt good about what I was seeing in April, nonetheless, we made some adjustments to our expected close rate in the quarter for the second quarter. And as we got to kind of leading to your question, the last week of the quarter, I think we saw perhaps a few more deals that did not get the final signature that we expected them to get. And then your follow-on part of your question is, what are we seeing in July, and that's why I'm making the point that I think I'm very -- we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of July of sales activity, whether you measure it base on growth or linearity against our target as well as the pipeline and as well as considering what we might call pandemic-related close rates. Hamza Fodderwala : Got it. Got it. And just a follow-up question, if I may. On the government vertical, obviously, that's a big one for you. Could you comment a little bit about on how that grew from a year-on-year perspective? And what you see in the pipeline, especially with the U.S. federal close coming up? Keith Jensen : Yes. So keep in mind, our U.S. Federal business -- our federal business is -- our government business, excuse me, it has 3 components. It has a U.S. Fed, it has international governments and it has state and local governments. And I would say that the performance was strong across at about 26% growth, 25% growth, but that was not driven by state and local government. State and local government suffered. And then the U.S. Fed part of our business is not a huge part of our business. So you're really looking at, while the U.S. Fed did well, we had nice, very attractive growth internationally with our government segment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : You guys continue to execute well, putting up better results than your nearest competitors. And the diversification of your business is on full display this quarter, which is great to see. Can you comment at all just in terms of the competitive dynamic that you're seeing out there? And maybe anything that you can share in terms of the pricing dynamic as well? Ken Xie : Yes. I think with the -- like a 73% business come from FortiGate. So with the new release of like today, the high-end and most high-end product to support hyperscale. So we see the performance that keep increased as we are getting much better, better and at the same time, in the last few quarters, the SoC4-based like from 60F to 80F to 100F 40F, we're also starting to see huge investment of growth in the field, especially, you can see the SMB, they usually buy this low-end SoC-based product also is growing quite well. So that's where from the product we see because we're keeping investment high in this ASIC, which has a much better computing power and a security function compared to the general purpose CPU, so the recorded security compute rating come from like 25x better to like today's products like 13x better than the competitor. It's a huge advantage and plus additional function like SD-WANs and other parts. So we see a quite a huge advantage and more gap compared with competitor. They probably will keep on pushing some software or some other form of deployment, which because it did have a difficult time competing with us into this appliance or some other base. But for us, also, we're positioned to have the whole infrastructure solution, not just the appliance base, but also in the cloud and in the software base, and then also offer different kind of deployment, different kind of service. We also see quite good healthy growth from that angle. And that's where the -- we call the fabric approach, the fabric solution. Amount of revenue is still like almost double compared to FortiGate growth. So we still see pretty healthy like once you get in leverage of FortiGate, then we can more easy to expand into the other non-FortiGate growth. So that benefit the fabric advantage still keeping help us grow faster above-average because it's really -- the consolidation is still the -- still is the trend in the whole industry there. So customers want to reduce the management cost. They prefer to consolidate some of the vendors, which we started to see more benefit for us because most product function, we do develop in-house, which make it integrate and automate on day 1 compared to some other competitive dependent acquisitions, more difficult to integrate and automate. So that's what we see is we continue to invest long term both on the product technology infrastructure side, and we do believe it's a long-term gain. And so that's where so we're keeping gaining market share. And we do see the gap bigger, and we have more advantage right now. Keith Jensen : Yes, Brad, it's Keith. I would continue on what Ken's comments there a little bit. And keeping in mind, I made a reference to it in the text that we're seeing a new cost advantage evolved within the E-Series, and we expect it to continue with the F-Series. I mean I think that the company can has done a tremendous job with the ASIC Advantage of driving down the cost in subsequent generations of the chip at the same time, driving up the performance. That gross margin performance that I mentioned earlier in the script, that actually came with it with just a small headwind with discounting for the first time. And you may have been asking a discounting question. Discounting is the first time we've seen that in several quarters, about 0.5 point, if you will, perhaps increase in discounting. But that cost structure that's coming with the ASIC Advantage that I made reference to is more than enough to outweigh that. Brad Zelnick : Thank you both so much for the very thorough answers. And I would just say that the competitive differentiation of your strategy continues to shine through. Congrats. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard. Walter Pritchard : Two product questions. First, just on the -- I think last quarter, you had some real strength in the remote access, things like authenticators and tokens. Just curious how that continued into this quarter. And then also on the SASE side, when are you talking about having an integrated SASE SD-WAN product in the market? Keith Jensen : I'll take the first one. In very round numbers, I would say, if I got a benefit of, call it, very round numbers, $10 million in the first quarter. I probably got half that benefit in the second quarter on those 3 work-from-home products. Ken Xie : Okay. The SASE we're offering them to the customer to the partner this quarter, and it's part of what we call the fabric FortiSASE solution. And we do see the interest both from the existing customers, from new customers. And at the same time, a lot of our service provider partners are also very interested in this. And even some global customers, they also want to build their own version of SASE, which we are also supporting them behind. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : My question is more general about the market. The data shows that the firewall market has been slowing down tremendously in the last few quarters, 6 or 7 quarters of decline. What is your experience with the market? I'm trying to understand if your continued growth is a question of continued share gain or new products that are compensating for firewall weaknesses. So what's your view of the overall market and the drivers for firewall demand in the market? Ken Xie : Yes, the traditional firewall, they're more secured, we called the border [ph], which is positioned between the internal network LAN and also the Internet. That part is, like I say, there's a -- no longer enough. There's a multiple way you can bypass that and also a lot of application, a lot of -- since also go beyond the company network, they go to the cloud. They go to some other part like mobile access. So that's where the traditional firewall where we do see the growth slowdown. That's where we keep expanding beyond like we expand the WAN and that's we call security-driven network in that space and even building of the FortiGate and make it part of the WAN solution and also part of cloud solution. At the same time, internally also expand total internal segmentation, like with the switch, with Wi-Fi access point. That part is also growing very, very well and quite strong. And so like I said is we keep in saying now, we say it's a third-generation of network of security infrastructure from the traditional connection base to when we formed Fortinet. We called it content application-based security. And now it's more like the whole infrastructure security including both the traditional gateway and also go to the Internet and the WAN connection, cloud solution and the SASE, at the same we can go internal for the segmentation for the switch for the Wi-Fi, it's the whole new enterprise, the end point of different application. So it's the whole infrastructure security, we feel is a new trend, which we prepare all this using the fabric, using ASIC, increase the computing power to address the network speed issue. We keep in doing this in the -- for about 20 years since we found the company. So we're starting to see the investment we made, whether from ASIC, from the technology from the product side, from the infrastructure side, starting more benefit us and differentiate Fortinet compared to some other competitors, still relatively. It's the same approach compared to the early day of network security. So that's what we see as a gap and the advantage we have is kind of bigger and bigger going forward. Tal Liani : Got it. And the migration to SASE, isn't it going against your core offering? Ken Xie : No. It's a part of the whole infrastructure security and like SD-WAN because for the SASE is really, you need the access to it, right? So that's where SD-WANs and other parts really have a good way to access that. So we are built in into the FortiGate and has huge performance and functional advantage. And at the same time, the service model leverage, the infrastructure we have, the customer base we have, that's where the OPAQ acquisition keeping enhanced this part. So that's what we address some of the new things the customer need. And at the same time, the partner also see how we can like working closely with them to supporting the customer better, give them the additional flexibility no matter what kind of format of security form that they want. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess first one, you guys mentioned a couple of times about certain deals just getting pushed out from June into the September quarter. Any sense you could give in terms of the deal size or the verticals where you saw this happening? And I guess if you didn't have any of these issues, what would the June quarter revenue look like? Keith Jensen : I don't know if there was a common -- well, first of all, large deals for us, it would be $1 million, right? They're not $10 million, $20 million or $30 million deals. So you're probably looking at some number of those transactions that moved. I don't know that there was a common theme in terms of verticals, if you will. I do think that it was a bit more of a challenge in the U.S. than it was in other geographies on that close rate for the last week of the month -- or the last week of the quarter. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And I guess, last quarter on this one, you've talked some amount about perhaps using your financial strength as a way to essentially accelerate your share gains. Could you just touch on what impact would that have in your free cash flow or even your margins perhaps? Just want a sense -- just trying to get a sense of how much are you willing to flex your model? And what sort of share gain aspirations would you have from these dynamics that you would take on? Keith Jensen : Yes. There's probably 3 places that you could see. One is looking at the inventory because we're -- in this environment, we'd like to keep a little more inventory on hand. And so when you look at the inventory turns, I think the number was 2.2 in the quarter, and that's probably down about 1. And so you can do some math there and quantify it. You can also look -- the second place you would see it is on the extended payment terms. We provide the metric of what our contractual payment terms were as of at the end of the quarter, which I think was 67 days, and that's up 17%. The third place that we can flex a little bit is on discounting, and I kind of covered that a moment ago. That while discounting in the current economic environment is a fact of life, and we did have a slight increase in discounting, for us, it was outweighed by the structural difference in our cost structure, which more than outweigh it.  So, in terms of flexing our balance sheet and looking at the cash flow model, if you will, I think the key place for inventory and then looking at the collections. Peter Salkowski : And just one correction on the contractual payment terms, it was 62 days. Keith Jensen : I'm sorry. I'm happy. I'm happy it's only 62. Operator : And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Chris. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. Fortinet will be attending the following virtual investor conferences during the third quarter. We'll be doing the Oppenheimer conference next week on August 11; the Citibank conference on September 9; and the Colliers Securities conference on September 10. Event presentations will be webcast and links from these webcasts will be available on the Investor Relations website of the Fortinet IR site. If there are any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I'm pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the third quarter of 2020. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then follow that with a review of our financial and operating results for the third quarter, before providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A, we ask that you please keep your questions brief and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, to allow other to participate. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call we will be making forward-looking statements and those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also all references to financial metrics that we make on today's call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are on our Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our third quarter 2020 results. We are very pleased with our third quarter performance. Billing increased 20% to $750 million. Our SD-WAN solution more than doubled year-over-year and represent over 13% of total billings. Total revenue increased 19% to $651 million, with product revenue growth accelerating quarter-over-quarter to 14% and service revenue up 22%. Recently, Fortinet was the only vendor recognized as a leader in both the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge infrastructure and Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewalls. Fortinet's FortiGate SD-WAN is the only organically built solution that provides networking and security integrated into a single appliance that delivers leading protection, performance and cost saving for the largest customer base and fastest revenue growth among major players in the space. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation. And organizations has to deal with new challenges to secure the whole infrastructure in the zero-trust environment, whether it's a WAN, cloud, data center, network, branch or home edge. Fortinet is helping customers solve these issues through security-driven networking and our platform approach. FortiGate Security Fabric which combine networking and security across the entire connect environment provide protection whether on-premise, virtual or cloud-based environment. Our recent Fortinet survey of cybersecurity leaders showed almost 70% of organizations have concerns about insider threat. Today, Fortinet announced a FortiGate 2600F for enterprise-level internal segmentation and hyperscale data center in multi-cloud environment. Powered by the new NP7 security processor, the FortiGate 2600F offer the highest performance with a secure computing up to 10 time higher than our competition. Gartner has stated that over the next few years, edge and immersive technologies will begin to replace cloud and mobile. The release of several new appliance called by our latest FortiASIC SPU, together with cloud and software-based virtual machine could replace security anywhere, will enable Fortinet to capitalize on this investment and will fuel our growth going forward. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners worldwide for their continued support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Let's start the third quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $651 million was up 19%. Product revenue of $224 million was up 14%, benefiting from strong demand for secure SD-WAN, high-end FortiGate and cloud solutions. Service revenue increased 22% to $427 million. FortiGuard service revenue increased 22% to $235 million. FortiCare service and other revenue increased 21% to $192 million. The revenue mix shift from 8x5 to 24x7 support was 11 points, with 24x7 now representing over 65% of the mix. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue. FortiGate product and service revenue increased 16%. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue grew 27%, driven by growth in cloud and fabric solutions. Given the continuing strong growth of our non-FortiGate or fabric platform, it's worth noting the absolute size of this business. For example, during the trailing 12-month period, ended September 30 2020, non-FortiGate products and services totaled $668 million, an increase of 26.5% when compared to the previous 12-month period. Revenues and solutions include the complete range of form factors and delivery methods including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Combined with our FortiGate business, we offer our customers the needed range of security solutions and form factors enabling them to provide security across their entire IT infrastructure, whether it's at the WAN, cloud, data center, network branch or even home office edge. Our third quarter performance illustrates the benefits of our diversification across geographies, customer segments and industry verticals. Looking at revenue by Geos. As with the second quarter, our geographic revenue performance aligned with the economic impact of the pandemic and with it highlighted the geographic diversification of our business. As summarized on slide 5, revenues in Asia Pacific, increased 27.5% as many Asian countries and economies have been able to remain largely open. Revenue growth for the Americas of 13%, continue to reflect the impact of the pandemic, especially in Latin America as well as a very difficult year-over-year comparison. Revenue growth for the Americas in the third quarter of 2019 was over 24%, the highest of all three geographies. If we shift to billings, total billings increased 20% to $750 million. Looking at billings by solutions segment; FortiGate billings increased 16% and accounted for 72% of total billings. As shown on slide 6 high-end FortiGate posted strong billing growth in the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29%, with strong demand for fabric and cloud solutions. As with revenue, our billings performance by geos aligned with the economic impact of the path of the pandemic. APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe, and then the Americas, including Latin America. Now turning to billings by customer segments. As we experienced in the second quarter, we saw solid billing growth in the SMB, a large enterprise segments. SMB posted strong growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our channel programs, the solid execution by our channel employees and partners, and the large diverse makeup of this multinational customer segment. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Our top five verticals continue to account for about two-thirds of total billings. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 20% of total billings and grew at over 40%. We experienced solid performance internationally and in the U.S. at the local levels. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Financial services with 14% of total billings also had a very strong billings growth quarter at 27%. Education with 9% of total billings rebounded in the third quarter as schools prepare for secure e-learning in the fall semester. Now looking at deals by dollar size. We had 48 deals over $1 million in the third quarter, compared to 53 deals in the third quarter of 2019 and 30 deals in the third quarter of 2018. Secure SD-WAN accounted for seven of the deals over $1 million and while down from eight deals over $1 million a year ago, total SD-WAN billings more than doubled, and as Ken mentioned, accounted for approximately 13% of total billings. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 130 basis points to 79.5%. Product gross margin improved 220 basis points to 62.9%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products, offset slightly by higher indirect costs. It's worth noting that for five quarters in a row, including two pandemic quarters, product gross margin has been over 60%. Operating margin for the third quarter increased 90 basis points to 27.4%, benefiting from the improvement in gross margin and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses related to the shift towards virtual events, offset by the addition of new team members. Total head count ended the quarter at 8,075, a 23% increase driven by the increased investments we've made to grow our business. Given the strong operating income performance, net income for the third quarter was $145 million. And earnings per diluted share increased $0.21 to $0.88 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $123 million or $0.75 per diluted share versus GAAP income of $80 million or $0.46 per diluted share a year ago. The strong performance this quarter is the result of the diversification of our business and the strategic long-term investments we've made to expand our global sales force, to invest in our channel partners and to expand our product offerings and provide a truly integrated security platform enabling automation. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slide seven and eight. Free cash flow came in at $186 million. As we commented previously, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and our customers as they experience the economic challenges of the pandemic. As a result average days sales outstanding increased to 76 days, up three days sequentially and 13 days year-over-year in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Inventory turns decreased to 2.1x as we increased our on-hand inventory to mitigate supply chain risk. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $35 million including $26 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the fourth quarter to between $40 million and $50 million and for all of 2020 to between $130 million and $140 million. The lower full year CapEx range is due to utilities and other delays in the construction of our new campus building that are pushing more spending to 2021. Our move in date has moved to mid-2021. The average contract term for the third quarter was 26 months, flat year-over-year as well as sequentially. We expect full year cash taxes to be approximately $40 million and our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on slide nine which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $890 million to $920 million. Revenue in the range of $710 million to $730 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 29%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.95 to $0.97, which assumes a share count of between 157 million and 169 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Having said that, based on this fourth quarter guidance, we expect to achieve the rule of 40 for the full year making 2020 the third consecutive year in the ninth year of the last 11 years that we've been able to achieve this milestone. So, along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and the Fortinet team for their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Peter Salkowski : Thank you. Operator please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking our question and congrats on a nice quarter of results. I was wondering maybe if you could touch on what you're seeing in the spending environment. Particularly it sounded like you had a really nice quarter of fabric growth and SD-WAN demand. But we also picked up physical firewall strength in the quarter. So, maybe from the standpoint of what you're hearing from CIOs and what actually surprised you the most about the demand in the quarter? Ken Xie : Yes. Brian, this is Ken. That's a good question. We also closely monitor watching the whole since change in the space. Basically so that's where we're keeping promoting we call secure-driven networking. And also that's the concept we try to the thinking we have in the last 20 years. So, you can see the definitely the SD-WAN starting -- come to the networking side and probably in the next three years can grow over $20 billion. So that will be huge. We want to be the leader number one in the space hope to target next year. And at the same time the security is at Zero Trust concept starting to get very popular. So, we need to make the whole infrastructure very secure. And also the work for home also starting changing a lot. Like in early this year once the pandemic just started and people -- enterprise just try to see how IT can supporting work from home. Now, they're starting to try to see what's the long-term solution whether some service-based SASE or some other way they call the home is the new branch right? So, that's where we can have the FortiGate installed in the home can manage much broader device. It can also like traffic shaping like many different priority for different application, different users and at the same time can secure the whole infrastructure that sometimes they also call the SD branch solution. That's where managed Wi-Fi and manage other switch other networking equipment altogether and also even the printer or the other home appliance. So, that's we're starting to see. Some -- even some big enterprise or some -- working with whatever service provider some companies started offer the employee because this is what they call the new branch. They not only give them some kind of FortiGate planning, but also including the internet access including like whether 4G, 5G, 3G, 4G, 5G or some other things altogether. It's kind of a packaged solution and to help them secure it they call them the whole infrastructure security. So, that's why we see both kind of approach. So we're closely working with service provider, whether to the service base SASE or to this kind of a whole infrastructure security approach, but the new branch \u2013 home's-the-new-branch approach. So it's definitely changing the whole environment. So the security no longer just secure the gateway the border and we expect the whole infrastructure. And at the same time, the network also need to be more application awareness, like based on application like SD-WAN, or some other based on the content like there are certain content and provider also starting to add in the security space. So that's what keep us saying the secure-driven network is starting to kind of ramp up quickly. Brian Essex : Got it. That's super-helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on that SASE comment. Any \u2013 and I know, I'm going to mispronounce this, but any initial traction with OPAQ or OPAQ through MSSP channel and how much progress have you made with that relationship so far? Ken Xie : Yeah. We acquired OPAC last quarter, and we're working together to make it the whole solution for the SASe. Also, we work closely \u2013 working with a lot of service provider, because we do keep it same for a few years. The service provider has the best position to offer a lot of service. So we help them. And also FortiGate is one of the best platform they can build whether within their POP or even extend into the branch or extend to \u2013 inside the company. So it's a good change in the space. Brian Essex : Got it. Thank you very much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Thank you for taking the question. Keith, I have two for you. Just looking at your outlook and your billings guidance I wanted to unpack that a little bit and get your sense of where you are being a little bit more cautious relative to the performance quarter and how we should think about some of the puts and takes into the guidance that implies a deceleration from the third quarter performance you just put up? And I have a follow-up as well. Keith Jensen : Sure. Look, I think it's shown 2020 has shown to be a very interesting year for setting guidance. Q1 was very, very strong. Q2 was challenging. Q3 is a nice bounce back. It's really a function of watching media reports almost on a daily basis in terms of what's happening with the pandemic whether \u2013 what we see happening in the U.S. We can also layer into that the U.S. election, but also what we're seeing in Europe. And I think in the current environment, I think the guidance does a pretty good job of trying to reflect our current understanding of the pandemic. Fatima Boolani : Fair enough. And just a bigger picture question for you. As I think about the complexion of your 2021 margin profile, if I look at 2020 you're head and shoulders above the sort 25% operating margin watermark that you've spoken to historically. So I'm wondering, as we think maybe longer term over the next couple of quarters what are some of the structural versus temporal impacts on the margin trajectory from here considering the pandemic trade-off and some of the acceleration you've undertaken on the sales hiring front? I would love to parse through that out with you. That would be really helpful. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think the \u2013 to kind of start top-down on that I think the product gross margin and probably why we made reference to it in the call being over 60% for I think five quarters in a row. There were some periods of time there it was probably in the higher 50s. We like very much in terms of the structure that we're seeing in terms of our pricing and our cost structure and gross margin. And even as we continue to introduce new products, hopefully, we'll be successful at that 60% gross margin number. And as you kind of move your way down to the income statement, I think it's really a sales and marketing conversation in terms of spending. Clearly, we're continuing to get the benefit of not having salespeople travel and not \u2013 the financial benefits excuse me of having salespeople not travel as well as marketing programs being virtual. And to the extent that the world stays that way we're going to continue to get that benefit. Now, obviously and I think we've talked previously that we're very committed to use this as an opportunity to bring in more salespeople. We talked about our head count growth of 23%. Hopefully, that we timed this right such that when those newer salespeople are coming online they're fully productive. It will be around the time that they're adding to the top line at the same time travel and marketing programs revert to historical norms. Fatima Boolani : Appreciate the detail. Thank you, Keith. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the solid performance and outlook. I had a question on the SD-WAN opportunity. And given the ongoing strength you're seeing. Have you started to see some displacement opportunities given potential disruption that one of your competitor's smaller competitors in the space could be seeing given a consolidating market? Ken Xie : This is Ken. No. We still see very strong interest and no competitor comes close to what we have. So we see that it's more than double year-over-year. And also we are the only one who has two Magic Quadrant both on SD-WAN also the network firewall come for the same appliance. And at the same time, it's 13% of last quarter's billing, but we have a huge installation base. A lot of customers even enable that one. We are not quite even confident on that one. So we believe we are a much bigger user base about like -- we call secure SD-WAN solution. And also going forward, I'd say the work-from-home also will be helping driving this whether you treat home as a new branch or whatever this kind of solution. So we feel we have a market position technology and also the only one build internal organically and also have ASIC to accelerate the performance on average about 10 times faster than any other competitor. So that's where we see is a huge opportunity. And the market grow like 50% year-over-year and we grew more than double year-over-year. It's -- we keep gaining market share. Keith Jensen : Yes. Shaul, it's Keith. I think Ken's spot on with that. I think if we look forward in terms of the opportunities what Ken is referring to is look I think there's still the opportunity in front of us to -- to help the service providers unpack their existing relationship with their incumbents on the SD-WAN side and that's something I think we're very focused on and as we start to see the SD-WAN is a critical component of SASE and the cloud on-ramp. So I think to Ken's point that market is going to continue to expand for us. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Got it. No that is super helpful. And maybe a question on the Americas performance. Keith when you isolate the mixed Latin American performance and strictly focusing on the northern part of the Americas how would you characterize the performance slightly more in line with your internal expectations heading into the quarter? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the U.S. -- well there's three components to the Americas -- Latin America which is a very difficult place currently. And we saw that in the numbers. We expect a difficult quarter of Latin America. And we've certainly got that. Canada on the other hand has actually done fairly well throughout this. It's just a different footprint in terms of the pandemic. To your specific question related to the U.S. I think the U.S. did much better in the third quarter than it did in the second quarter. But clearly I would not say that we're at pre-pandemic levels for the U.S. There's still opportunity there for us. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Thank you so much. Good luck. Good job. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Grea. Thanks so much and congrats on the acceleration of the business. It's great to see. My first question for you Ken. I wanted to ask about the impact of 5G on your business. It seems we're approaching a tipping point in terms of broader 5G coverage. So my question is how should we think about the benefits of your business and why you feel that Fortinet is competitively advantaged as we approach this tipping point? Ken Xie : 5G so far it is more connect to the device than connect to the people like 3G, 4G in the past. And also it depends on the vertical industry. And we're also leading a lot of our OT/IoT security. But also, like when work-from-home could be also a good back half for this like WAN access. But it's -- so we see quite a lot of successful case on international right now that seems more a little bit ahead on some of the 5G deployment and also working closely with the carrier service provider. Like I said in the last quarter earnings it's kind of growing faster than we expected and probably still on a very small base. But we do believe next year could be material the 5G contribute for our growth. Brad Zelnick : Great to hear. Thank you. And for Keith, last quarter you mentioned the discounting had picked up for the first time in a couple of quarters. How do you characterize discounting in Q3 at this point? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Flat. Consistent with what it was a year ago. Nothing to call out. So I guess the way to give that color I think we felt a little more pressure in the second quarter. We do not feel that same pressure in the third quarter. Brad Zelnick : Great to hear. Thank you so much for taking my questions, guys. Keith Jensen : Thanks, Brad. Operator : Our next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Keith, maybe first for you a housekeeping question. Can you just talk about some slight changes to the deferred revenue balance historically? I know there's a footnote in the earnings slide, but maybe you could just expand on what the adjustment is and how that impacted deferred and billings just so that we're all on the same page? Keith Jensen : Yes. We had a little housekeeping to go through with a subset of our FortiCare contracts. Historically and this goes back many years, we probably should have been recognizing revenue a little bit sooner starting the amortization period than we had been. So there's a little bit of a pickup on quarterly FortiCare service revenue. Its range is very small. It ranges from 0.1% to about 0.5% of revenue for any particular period. When we file the 10-Q there'll be a long footnote that shows every possible period and so forth. But that's all just a little bit of housekeeping to pick up some revenue there. Saket Kalia : Okay. Got it. So just to be clear the billings that was reported in the quarter the $750 million that really it wouldn't have been impacted by sort of that change right? Keith Jensen : No, no, no. Saket Kalia : Okay. Got it. I understood. The follow-up for you Ken just on the product side -- I guess as OPAQ becomes a bigger part of the offering how do you think about the strength of the FortiGate line that maybe helps differentiate when you're offering a SASE solution? Does that make sense? Ken Xie : Yes. I think, FortiGate is a very important part of SASE because they are the best firewall or SD-WAN or the other things can be positioned within the pop or sometimes we can working with service provider to use the FortiGate to be part of their service their solution there. And at the same time, we also do believe sometimes you also need to have a kind of a different approach like appliance can be in the home or can be in the branch or can be in the -- within the data center and the secure its traffic. So that's where we see FortiGate as a very good platform for keeping expanding we call the -- whether the whole infrastructure security or secure-driven networking, including both inside SASE POP all kind of secure the other part of infrastructure. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Matt on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more on SD-WAN. I was wondering if you guys could give additional color on what you make of the competitive landscape currently and what you've seen on pricing on that front? Thanks. Ken Xie : Yes. We offer the most the best pricing performance and also more functional SD-WAN than any other competitors. And SD-WAN is the probably one of the fast-growing area also one of the biggest market potential. So there's multiple research say, would be reached over $20 billion in like five to 10 years probably even bigger than the network security. And that's for us, also we want to combine these two together. So you see the same platform for both. So that's where compared to other competitor, which is only the software approach or sometimes even to weather the -- we call the universal CP or loading some other appliance. So we have this ASIC-dedicated hardware and plus like -- both in the low mid to high-end range can be within the POP or go to the home branch or go to -- within the data center inside the cloud. So that's where we see it's a huge advantage compared to other competitors. And also from the Gartner Magic Quadrant from the growth we have and we do believe we'll be the number one leader in the space. Keith Jensen : Yes. Matt I -- Ken's spot on with that. I think he's probably being a little bit humble, because I think really what's going on is because of the ASIC strategy and what he's built he's been able to increase the capacity in the firewall ritually each and every year. And it's a matter of how you use that capacity. Different SD-WAN vendors have different pricing methods. But for Fortinet it's embedded in the operating system and firewall. We do not charge for it separately. When you purchase a firewall you receive the SD-WAN functionality. So I don't really think that -- and certainly, we did not see anything in terms of our discount as we talked about that suggested any sort of change. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's very helpful. And then just one quick housekeeping question. So, going back to Saket's question on billings. If we just take the change in deferred on the balance sheet and the revenue, it seems like there's a disconnect to that and what you reported on billings. I was wondering if there was anything there to kind of unpack? Keith Jensen : No. I don't think so. I mean it's a pretty darn good definition. Billings is really defined as being revenue plus or minus the change in deferred revenue unless you have an acquisition or something like that. There should not be a difference there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks guys. Ken Xie : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. Congrats on the nice quarter. So you called out strength in high-end billings this quarter, but it's actually been very strong for the last three quarters, which is somewhat surprising given that we're in the middle of a pandemic. So can you just provide any more color on what's driving that consistently strong growth in high end? Ken Xie : There are some related to the new NP7, because -- as compared to NP6, they improve in the performance by almost 5x and also now can process like a 200-gig traffic per ship compared to the 40 gig and also more function there. So that's where we're starting to roll out the new NP7 with -- NP7 product only go to the high and middle range. And at the same time we do see certain vertical also help drive some high end like the finance service, some government sector, which they mostly buy the high end which has a less impact by the pandemic. Maybe Keith has other point. Keith Jensen : No. I think I would point the 1100E -- 1100F, excuse me. Yes. The product that's been out here for about a year now and it's done very, very well. It performed extremely well in the third quarter and I think it's been ramping up as we expect typically with the high-end products. Ken Xie : Yes. Also SD-WAN in probably half or probably -- come from the high-end contribution. Andrew Nowinski : That makes sense. Thank you. And then why do you think you saw fewer $1 million deals this quarter given the strength in the high-end billings that we've seen? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think it's a very good question. We came into the quarter looking at the pipeline and actually had a little bit of risk, I thought because we had a larger mix of larger deals. And then when we got through the quarter, obviously, that -- the mix actually shifted on us a little bit. I mean, we've all read reports that maybe in general that deals are getting a little bit smaller and what have you and maybe that has something to do with it. But I really don't have good information in terms of why -- what ended up -- I mean what you get every quarter always differs from the pipeline. I don't know why is that particular item different this time. Ken Xie : But the deal over $500000 has increased a lot right? And also compared to one year ago. Q3 last year we grew -- one year ago we grew $1 million deal quite a large number. So that's a very small comparison. Keith Jensen : Yes. And Ken makes a very good point. In fact if you look at deals of over SD-WAN deals over $250000 those were up well over 200% year-over-year. Andrew Nowinski : That makes sense. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Calvin Patel : Hi, guys. This is Calvin Patel on for Hamza. Congrats on the quarter. And thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could first comment a bit more on invoice durations and how you see that trending in your more recent conversations as we go forward. Keith Jensen : Invoice duration was that -- I'm sorry was that the question? Calvin Patel : Yes. Keith Jensen : Yes. We've been right at that, despite what maybe some other competitors expected to see one year 1.5 years ago. I think we've been very consistent throughout that time frame at about 25, 26 months. Calvin Patel : All right. Perfect. And then just as a follow-up, if you could comment a bit more on the competitive landscape in firewall this time not just on the SD-WAN segment? And if you think that there will be some level of digestion to occur over the next year or not? Ken Xie : We're keep gaining market share quickly in the firewall market. But also I believe going forward, we keeping saying this for a long time. Almost since beginning of -- we started the company 20 years ago. So the new networking will be more secure-driven. So instead the networking routing switch all about connectivity and speed they need to make sure they can give with application. That's why SD-WAN is application based on the routing networking and also they can deal with all the content and also user device level. That's all security handling. So that's where we see probably the traditional -- whether the traditional network security which is on a security border or the traditional networking probably also need doing some transition change. So the network security is still about $20 billion market probably. And the traditional networking may be $70 billion, $80 billion market. But they probably will starting merging and transitioning change. We feel we're leading this changing. And there will be -- we're also in very good position very good technology to really address the new secure-driven networking. Calvin Patel : Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Justin Roach : Hey guys, this is Justin on for Rob. I just had a quick one on the federal government vertical strength in the quarter just how it was trending relative to your expectations? And maybe if there is anything that we could impact on what drove the strong quarter? Keith Jensen : Yes. It's not -- if you go back and look at the phrase very closely we're not talking about U.S. Federal. We're talking about government which for us is more international government as well as local governments. U.S. Fed is not a large part of our business. Justin Roach : Got you. And then also just a quick follow up maybe just on your pipeline relative to where it's sitting now relative to last year and how you feel going in the fourth quarter just given it's usually historically your biggest? Keith Jensen : Yes. Well pipeline is probably the biggest input to the guidance setting process right? And there's all kinds of different ways of slicing and dicing it when we go through that whether it's deal size whether it's new logo versus an existing customer whether it's a new deal versus a renewal deal or what have you. And I think that clearly the pipeline supports the guidance. Justin Roach : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Patrick Colville : Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on a very impressive quarter. Can we just talk about SD-WAN again? The result you guys put out was super-impressive doubling of growth year-on-year. We have been hearing the media on checks around some firms kind of closing or rationalizing their branch offices. So clearly that hasn't had any effect on your business. But can you just talk me through whether you've heard that amongst your customers, or anything related to that point would be great? Ken Xie : Yes. Because it's a huge benefit for forward and the price of some other customers even including the home user consumer to us SD-WAN as it costs probably more than a 50% cost saving. And also they offer like how to manage multiple links among different kind of application and because the fixed connection whether the MPLS or some other one has a difficult time to manage like different application based on different cloud or kind of a different dynamic environment. So SD-WAN is the technology they can manage the traffic based on different applications even different content or some other security need as FortiGate's doing. It's a huge benefit for the user. That's driving the growth even during this pandemic. And also we believe the long-term work-from-home can also quickly expand into a lot of consumer home user base. And just try to improve in the service supporting level from that angle, we should be working with a lot of service provider or some big enterprise right now. But as a long term we do believe they may change in the home networking space. It's just like whether you can software define or whatever application or content-based networking which can offer a lot of additional benefit compared to the fixed network kind of VPN access. So it gets a lot of customer interest. That's the reason the market grow like 50%. And I believe probably I don't know how long maybe 10 years or could be sort of longer eventually we do believe half of majority of the whole networking space mainly this kind of SD-WAN approach based on application content without the traffic. Patrick Colville : Great. That's very clear. I mean one of the points you made was around I guess the devices at the branch office. I mean how often does the FortiGate SD-WAN solution sits alongside a traditional router? And how often is it a replacement of the traditional router? Ken Xie : We only need one FortiGate replace our router out of security or the Wi-Fi access controller all these kinds of thing. It's a single device as a multifunction can replace like a three, four, five device including router, including the SD-WAN and including the security gateway, VPN and then also the Wi-Fi controller. Patrick Colville : And just a clarification. Is your point that in most cases FortiGate is a replacement for those devices? Ken Xie : Yes. Replaces multiple device altogether and become only device to stay there. Patrick Colville : Got it. Thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gray Powell of BTIG. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : This is Stefan on for Gray. Thanks for taking my question. Piggybacking off the last question about the branch office. Have you seen any meaningful change in demand or mix of growth between the branch office and data center firewalls? Ken Xie : Yes. And that's where you can see sort of vertical whether retail or whatever we still see pretty strong growth. I think I believe Keith mentioned maybe grow 40% something like that. And also the bigger potential is really the home is the new branch. So that's we're probably even bigger. But that's still in early stage because you still need help in the home user to manage some of that. I know service a lot of service providers right now are working with us, but at the same time certain enterprise also try to do that. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And as a follow-up, can you just talk about the linearity that you saw in the third quarter? There was some mention of deal delays in the U.S. Did those end up landing this quarter? Keith Jensen : I think you're talking about deals from Q2 that delayed. Do they come in the third quarter? The answer to that would be yes. We were pleased with what we saw. Well, we were pleased with what we saw in July in terms of the start that we got in the quarter. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Your line is open. Alex Frankiewicz : This is Alex Frankiewicz on for Adam. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on SD-WAN one more time. I was wondering how important is your ASIC in bake-offs? How important is that performance boost to customers and on SD-WAN? Are you finding that it's becoming more of a driving factor in purchasing decisions or do other core capabilities and functionalities come first when a customer is making a decision? Ken Xie : Yes. The ASIC gives them like almost 10 times more computing power. So that's where they can add like a security function manage other like Wi-fi some other device and at the same time can process traffic much quicker and can also like working with service providers some other one make sure that it's a total infrastructure security solution. So that's a huge advantage compared to the other software approach which they have a limited CPU computing power to many whether security or SD-WAN or some other like the platform which can only handle single function compared we build this for the ASIC versus FortiOS can handle multifunction replace multiple device. So that's where we see as a huge advantage. Alex Frankiewicz : Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. Looking ahead, more than just a few quarters looking kind of a couple of years out what kind of rule of 40 margin profile are you targeting? Are you focused solely on top line growth, or could you expect -- could we expect to see some margin drop-through to the bottom line? Keith Jensen : Yes. I'm managing Ken very closely. Ken Xie : He's many me very closely. Keith Jensen : We talked about our midterm range of being we want to have 25% operating margin right? The strategy remains the same balancing growth and profitability. We started the year believing that we would tilt towards growth. As we went through the year, I think the pandemic obviously impacts the ability to grow in a couple of those quarters. But longer-term, we still believe it's a balanced strategy towards balancing profitability and growth. We do believe there is an opportunity for growth no doubt about it. Alex Frankiewicz : Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS. Your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Thank you, gentlemen for letting me to hop back in. I wanted to double back on the billings questions earlier on. The calculated billings based on your deferred revenue disclosure and disclosed reported revenue sum to $720 million in the quarter. And so I just wanted to appreciate that $30 million delta between what you have in the press release and in the reported numbers and calculating the billings off the balance sheet deferred revenue metrics? Keith Jensen : Sure. When you have some housekeeping going on Fatima, I'll jump into. This is Keith. You can have one or three things. You can have something that's so small you just run it through in the current period. You can have something so large that you restate the prior period financial statements. You can have something in the middle, which is called a little R where you're going to recast financials. That's what this is. That $30 million when you see the 10-Q will come out of the opening retained earnings back in December 31 of 2017 I believe it is. And just from that point forward that the amortization starts being corrected. So internally, we have the information for you to actually track right now with the billings recalculation of that you need to see Q2's number as recast, right? And that's not in the financials that you have, right? So $30 million came out of deferred revenue three years ago for something that's been going on for many, many years in this small transaction type. And it finally became large enough to correct, right? The number that we reported is based upon recast revenue and recast deferred revenue for billings. Fatima Boolani : Fair enough. So it's essentially a cumulative impact that we'll see the details for -- in the filings at least? Keith Jensen : Yes. That's why I gave the quick sound bite earlier that the quarterly impact to revenue typically runs for each of the quarters that we looked at between 0.1 points and about 0.5 point of revenue. It's a very small item in any one quarter. Fatima Boolani : Understood. That's very clear. Thank you. And since I have you, Ken a question for you just around the SD-WAN discussion. From a product standpoint, I think there's a debate that's brewing between the thin branch architecture versus a thick branch deployment architecture within the SASE paradigm. So I'm wondering how Fortinet is positioned in the former. So in the thin branch arena if we think about the thick branch environment may be under potential duress in an increasingly uncertain macro environment. And that's it for me. Thank you. Ken Xie : I think both branch can fit into different environment. The thin branch sometimes it can stop certain mobile device issue. And the thick branch also can process the things locally in the real-time a lot of application need that. So the FortiGate is more like a POP in local whether in home or whatever in the office or it's in the POP and SASE environment. Which you can see how they process the traffic within the SASE infrastructure. That's how our FortiGate is the key point to really get this processed. So that's also because our -- it's an advantage. We have huge computing power advantage over other approach, which give us a kind of much better performance also lower cost. So that's where we had the flexibility converted to the appliance and on-premise or can be the virtual fit in the cloud or be part of the POP/SASE solution. So give us the flexibility and also can extend beyond some other competitor, other players can do which -- because if they're only limited for the software approach, they can only sit in certain server within the POP in the data center. So we can extend beyond that one go to the edge, go to the home and go to a lot of even other remote location. And that's also kind of using my quote from the Gartner is really -- so in the next few years that's what comes from Gartner research. They say the edge and the immersive technology will replace in the cloud and mobile. So that's where you see you need to have more computing everywhere in the real-time application environment. So that's where we developed is ASIC and all these different technology to working with our different service providers or different kind of vertical space to address this issue, especially the infrastructure keep changing with 5G with all this like. That's where the ASICs have more advantage compared to the software-only approach. Fatima Boolani : Very clear. Thank you so much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Patrick Colville : Hi, there. I'm copying Farima and hoping back in. Appreciate you letting me ask another question. How much did the Gartner's conclusion of Fortinet in the top-right corner of the SD-WAN MQ influence customer decision making? This time a year ago, you guys were just outside of the top-right corner and now you are in it. And so was that something that in your opinion might have changed the dialogue a bit and got Fortinet on more RFPs? Ken Xie : It helps on certain enterprise, but we also have a much broader sector and also the geo diversity. It's probably now that -- depending too much on the Magic Quadrant. But it's -- and we also have a -- like because -- like the new Magic Quadrant only come on end of the quarter. It's come up in September 30, the last day of the quarter. So I don't think\u2026 Keith Jensen : We don't close that fast. Ken Xie : Yeah. Sorry, I don't think we can't get that much business in the last day of the quarter in Q3. But it's helped probably more going forward. Keith Jensen : We certainly expect it's going to be helpful and a tailwind for us going forward yes. Patrick Colville : Great. Thank you so much. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski for closing your remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you Michelle. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending conferences by the way -- attending conferences in the fourth quarter. The Credit Suisse conference is on November 13th, as well as December 2nd, Raymond James conference on December 7th, the UBS conference on December 8th, and a Barclays conference on December 9th. Events with presentations will be webcast and the links will be available on our website the Investor Relations website at Fortinet. If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to contact me. Have a great day. Thank you very much. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I\u2019m pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet\u2019s fiscal results for fourth quarter of 2020. Speakers on today\u2019s call are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen our CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter, providing guidance for the first quarter of 2020 and the full year. We\u2019ll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please keep your questions brief and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, to allow others to participate. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that on today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today\u2019s call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Fourth quarter billing increased 20% to $961 million. Our secure SD-WAN offering accounted for over 13% of fourth quarter billing. Product revenue accelerated quarter-over-quarter to 21%, contributing to a total revenue growth of 21%. Operating margin benefited from solid revenue performance. We achieved all-time company record non-GAAP operating margin of 29.4% for the fourth quarter. Given the many opportunities ahead, we plan to shift our focus more to growth for the at least next few quarters. Today, we announced the FortiOS 7.0 with 300 new features and updates. With this release, Fortinet is the only leading cybersecurity vendor to offer firewall-based zero trust network access enabling remote access to replace the traditional VPN. This reduces attack surface while improving the user experience. Fortinet\u2019s Zero Trust Network Access solution also simplifies management by using the same access policy, whether on or off network. Tighter integration of a SASE solution with the FortiOS 7.0 gives enterprises the flexibility they need to enable their workforce to work from home with consistent, enterprise-grade security delivered on-premise, or now, via cloud-based SASE consumption for security-as-a-service. The FortiOS 7.0 extends network connectivity and security beyond the WAN Edge with innovations in 5G and LTE that improve the wireless network performance and increase resiliency. Our 5G offering enables organizations to achieve secure, scalable and highly available network connectivity anywhere. The release of FortiOS 7.0 expands the Fortinet Security Fabric delivering on our mission to provide broad, integrated and automated security to any device, any application everywhere. Cybersecurity is at an inflection point. And increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a platform approach and not just a separate platform for endpoint, network security or cloud security but a holistic platform that is integrated, automated across all this area. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cyber security platform built on broad and deep set of networking security technology from endpoint to network to cloud, organically built to seamlessly communicate and operate together. This consolidation with our security-driven networking approach will be key drivers going forward. Today Fortinet is recognized in 8th Gartner Magic Quadrant. Our FortiGate product is a leader in both, SD-WAN and the Next Generation Firewall Magic Quadrant. We continue to experience excellent adoption of our secure SD-WAN and expect our unique solution to become a market share leader within a few years. In addition, for our growth drivers, we estimate our total addressable market will grow at an annual compound rate of a 10% over the next four years to reach $93 billion by 2024. The recent SolarWinds security incident and the pandemic elevated the need for a broad, integrated and automated platform. And we expect companies will raise the percentage of IT spending used for security as they work to secure their entire infrastructure across multiple edges in a zero trust environment. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners worldwide for their continuous support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken.  Let\u2019s start the fourth quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $748 million was up 21%. Product revenue was up 21%. Service revenue was up 21%. Product revenue of $288 million saw substantial sequential acceleration in growth relating from strong demand for fabric -- Security Fabric Platform and FortiGate across all form factors, hardware, software, and virtual machine. While secure SD-WAN use cases continued their dramatic growth, the majority of product revenue was driven by the wide range of other operating system capabilities embedded in FortiGates and their related use cases. Service revenue of $460 million benefited from strong demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. Support and professional services revenue increased 21% to $210 million. The revenue mix shift from 8x5 to 24x7 support was 12 points, with 24x7 now representing 66% of the mix. Security subscription services and cloud provider revenue increased 21% to $249 million. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue. Network security revenue increased 18%, driven by the high end and entry-level FortiGate product families. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue increased 29%, driven by a 34% increase in revenue for fabric and cloud security solutions. Before continuing with the fourth quarter results, I\u2019d like to highlight our 2020 full-year revenue performance. In the midst of a pandemic induced recession, total revenue for the year grew 20% to $2.6 billion. We take great pride in our focus on organic growth. And 2020 represents the third consecutive year with revenue growth of 20%. This consistent performance speaks to our geographic and customer diversity, the continued success of the integrated platform strategy, and our proprietary ASIC advantage that enables a shared operating system across the platform, drives our cost per performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. Total non-FortiGate revenue for the year grew over 25% to more than $725 million. In other words, our fabric, cloud and other security products and services are on a pace to be a $1 billion business as we exit 2021. Our non-FortiGate and FortiGate products and solutions include a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments, and their expanding digital attack surface and edges. Pivoting back to our Q4 results, let\u2019s turn to revenue by geo. Our geographic revenue performance continued to align with the pandemic\u2019s economic path, and with it highlighted the geographic diversification of our business. As summarized on slide 7, revenue in Asia Pacific increased 23% as many Asian countries and economies continue to remain largely open. EMEA revenue increased 22%, and the Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. Let\u2019s shift to billings. Total fourth quarter billings were $961 million, up 20%. FortiGate billings increased 16% and accounted for 71% of total billings. As shown on slide 9, high-end and entry-level FortiGates posted strong billings growth for the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29% of total billings, driven by demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. As with revenue, geo billings performance aligns with the economic path of the pandemic. In terms of growth, APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. The Americas reflect the continuing impact of the pandemic and especially in Latin America. Moving to billings by customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos, illustrating the strength of our Engage channel partner program. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this multinational customer segment. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 17% of total billings and grew 28% with another strong performance from our international team. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Retail accounted for 10% of total billings, up 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. And Education continued to rebound with billings growth up 26% year-over-year. Looking now at deals by dollar size. We had 68 deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to 64 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 16 deals over $1 million, versus 11 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a full year basis, SD-WAN accounted for approximately 11% of our total billings and doubled year-over-year. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on slide 4, gross margin improved 40 basis points to 78.5%. The strong 29% quarter-over-quarter product revenue growth created a mix shift from services to product revenue. The mix shift was a headwind for quarter-over-quarter gross margin comparisons. Product gross margin improved 130 basis points to 63.2%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from a higher mix of software products and the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products. Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 210 basis points to 29.4%, benefiting from the gross margin improvement and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses, offset by the addition of new sales team members as we continue to prepare for additional growth. At the end of the year, the total headcount was 8,238, an increase of 16%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on slides 10, 11 and 12. Cash flow for the fourth quarter came in at $264 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $34 million. For the full year, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for a total cost of $1.1 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion with the authorization set to expire at the end of February in 2022. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experience geo-specific economic challenges. As a result, average days sales outstanding increased 8 days to 87 days, in line with our expectations and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. Inventory turns improved to 2.7 times from 2.1 times in the third quarter and was relatively flat year-over-year. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through at least the first half of 2021. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32 million, including $22 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We estimate capital expenditures for the first quarter between $50 million and $60 million, and for all of 2021 to be between $150 million and $170 million. 2021 CapEx projects include expanding our data center footprint and spending that was moved from 2020 due to delays in the new campus building. The average contract term in the fourth quarter was approximately 28 months, up less than 2 months from the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in SD-WAN and other large enterprise deals contributed to the increase. As we look forward, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2021, summarized on slide 13, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $765 million to $780 million; revenue in the range of $670 million is $685 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23.5%, reflecting the typical revenue seasonality associated with the first quarter; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75, which assumes a share count of between 167 million and 169 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before providing our 2021 guidance, I\u2019d like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team, for the truly outstanding execution in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges and rapidly changing and unpredictable dynamics. The effort and results have been outstanding. And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance, and continuing improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. Today, we reported our third consecutive year of total revenue growth of 20%, while increasing our non-GAAP operating margin, an average of over 200 basis points a year for the same period. Our goal remains to balance growth and profitability within the framework we have provided. As Ken mentioned, given the many growth opportunities that lie ahead, we currently plan to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline heading into 2021, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS 7.0 operating system. With that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3,560 million to $3,640 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 17%; revenue in the range of $3,025 million to $3,075 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%; total service revenue in the range of $2,015 million to $2,045 million, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 11% and $1 billion in product revenue for 2021, quite the milestone for Fortinet; non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis-point increase in operating margin for 2021. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.75, which assumes a share count of between 170 million to 172 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. Now, with Ken, I\u2019d like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work during these difficult and unique times. I\u2019d also like to offer a special welcome to the Panopta team. And I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Brian Essex : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on a great set of results. Maybe, Ken, if I could ask, you\u2019ve got a number of different product cycles ahead of you this year. You\u2019ve got NP7. You\u2019ve already talked about SD-WAN. You\u2019ve got hyperscale penetration and potential exposure to 5G. Can you maybe talk about the contribution from each of those that\u2019s embedded in your guidance? And, what are you seeing currently in the market, and what\u2019s yet to come? Ken Xie : I think for NP7, it\u2019s still in the ramp-up stage. We continue to build a new our platform using NP7, it\u2019s better for the high end and middle range. The FortiOS 7.0 is also a growth driver, but we are in the beta-3 process right now this quarter. That\u2019s what\u2019s helping contribute to the additional growth, especially in the zero trust and SASE environment and also this infrastructure security later this year, but it\u2019s -- so far, I see the product growth, like 21% is a lot of contribution from whether the SD-WAN or we call security-driven networking and also in the probably like 1 to 2 years ago, when we released the SoC4. So, that\u2019s a little bit towards the low end side of the FortiGate, which you can see nicely grows over there. And also the team is doing a great job in the sales and marketing. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the guidance, the process is not so much about individual products or even in some cases, individual use cases. We identified 15 to 20 different use cases for firewalls. It\u2019s more about what we see in terms of market opportunity, what we see in pipeline than maybe by geography or deal opportunity or what have you as some of the key inputs that go into it. But, I wouldn\u2019t really think of it as -- I certainly would not want you to walk away from the conversation thinking that the guidance that we provided is dependent upon some degree of 5G or SASE or something that\u2019s above and beyond. Brian Essex : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Nice large deal activity, certainly more than we picked up in the channel. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics on the large end of your market scale. Where you\u2019re seeing that business come from? How much is displacement, and how much is expansion of I guess existing customer opportunity? Ken Xie : Yes, definitely, whether from our customer or our partner is starting to get a much better, more competitive and a lot of advantage using the Fortinet product, whether the FortiGate leverage new ASIC, the new OS with much more additional function compared to competitor. So, that\u2019s where like increased gap we have ahead of competitor now. And that\u2019s actually helping to drive -- accelerate the product revenue growth. And on the other side, we have a little bit different approach for whether the SASE or cloud endpoint. So, we more emphasize, integrate together, automate together, especially in the OS level, that\u2019s -- none of our competitors has that. And also, most of this also organically internally developed, designed to work together, automate together from day one. That\u2019s also different from competitor, come from acquisition, which is more difficult to integrate and also difficult to manage long term. So, we do feel we have a more and more advantage in the marketplace right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Shaul Eyal : Congrats on the ongoing strong execution levels. I want to start with a gross margin related question. So, gross margins guidance for \u201921 indicates an improvement, 1 to 2 basis points on average. And I\u2019d like to understand whether it is driven by the ongoing shift to more cloud activities, i.e., more subscription services, or is it driven by some improvement with your ASIC-driven strategy? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think, the last part is probably the headline, which is that each successive generation of the ASIC in addition to creating more speed, more capacity, if you will, more throughput. It also creates capacity to consolidate features of the BOM that were previously separate. And the success of generation has shown the benefit of that. I think over the last year or two, we\u2019ve done a very good job of retaining that cost benefit in terms of the structure. You can look back and see what\u2019s happened with the gross margin, on the product gross margin line. Obviously, you do then also get the benefit in total, when you add into two-thirds of the business that are services that are coming at a much more attractive margin. So, the combination of those two, I think, is working very, very well for us as we exit 2020 and move into 2021. Shaul Eyal : And maybe high level on the Sunburst breach. Have you seen any incremental interest starting in mid-December, maybe building into year-end, again, just aside from the typical healthy year and seasonality trend? Ken Xie : I\u2019d say probably -- we do see a lot of need -- interest, especially to secure the whole infrastructure, including supply chain with all different third-party kind of product, all these things. But it\u2019s still -- I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely more people certainly interest in this area, but it\u2019s -- the business side is probably not changing that much yet. But, we do see going forward, probably later this year will be, because it\u2019s definitely with the security concern, like I mentioned, the security spending among our IT spending probably will keeping increase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : I have two questions. The first one is, Ken, in your prepared remarks, you said that this year is going to be a year of focus on growth. What does it mean? Does it mean that you\u2019re going to increase expenses and the margin increases will moderate? Can you elaborate on the meaning behind your statement that you\u2019re going to now focus on growth this year? And how does it differ from previous year, for example? Ken Xie : We do see like whether some investment we made in the sales and marketing, like we said, we have increased sales capacity and also we also have a better visibility, we increased the marketing. And at the same time, from the product, from infrastructure side, we also will keeping invest, especially organic internal development, like building the new infrastructure, and where to address the cloud and the networking endpoint and also working with service provider. So, basically, we do see -- the market itself also is starting kind of accelerating, especially in some new areas, whether the security-driven networking, including both SD-WAN or 5G, and that has the new infrastructure, but also some kind of a service model, leverage the infrastructure, which we will keeping invest more in there. So, that\u2019s what we feel. So, this will give us a much more growth opportunity and both internally like whether the NP7 or the FortiOS 7.0 is timing quite well. So, it will help us drive the faster growth. Tal Liani : And does it have any impact on margins. Keith Jensen : Yes. Tal, I\u2019ll just add to that. I think the -- sorry to interrupt you. Look, I think, we were very successful throughout 2020, even during the pandemic, maintaining our -- and growing our operating margins very dramatically, but at the same time, adding sales capacity. And I think, when we sat down to build the guidance out in the plan for 2021, coming into the year with the capacity levels that we have, together with the increase in tenure that we\u2019re seeing as well as the pipeline, I think we feel very good about this opportunity to take advantage of the growth. And I think, we\u2019re still -- I think, the margin guidance at the midpoint of 26% is very much within the framework and actually up a little bit. Tal Liani : Got it. My second question is about the needed investment in infrastructure to accommodate SASE and similar business models. What is the company doing in order to address it? Can you just elaborate on what\u2019s happening behind the scene? Ken Xie : Yes. The SASE approach for Fortinet is different than some other competitors. We do want to have a more integrated automated approach. And also, we are the only one in the OS level, both the SASE and also zero trust network access. So, that\u2019s making whether working with Fortinet or service provider or even customer enterprise themselves to develop their own kind of SASE approach, which will be much better fit for their own kind of privacy, whether it\u2019s GDP or some other requirement, it\u2019s much better secure compared to some other approach. So, that\u2019s where we feel -- we do have some investment, but some investments, like infrastructure, we\u2019re also working with our service provider together. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Ben Schmidt : Hi. This is Ben Schmidt on for Rob. Thanks for taking my questions. As much of the attention in the space begins to shift towards cloud and SASE, how do you think about your longer term strategy from a remote connectivity perspective? And what do you think -- and what do you expect for the branch office? Ken Xie : I think, for our technology, we can support in both the thin branch and the thick branch office approach. And also, even for the SASE, so we leave the flexibility to enterprise, which we can whether leverage the vendor or they can leverage their service provider or carrier or they can build themselves. So, that\u2019s why we say, we put in the OS level, it\u2019s much more integrated, automated compared to some other approach, which has to let vendors infrastructure. So for us, like this OS level integration of SASE will leave a lot of flexibility and gradually for the customer to transition, whether they move service-based or they still want to like have, we call security infrastructure approach. So that\u2019s where we have the flexibility to have customers select their own approach based on own need. And at the same time, we\u2019ll make the whole infrastructure secure, like we say, whether the security-driven networking with SD-WAN, 5G or internal segmentation, whether in the data center or with the enterprise campus environment. So, that\u2019s why we feel, even we take a little bit more time to build this kind of a highly integrated OS level approach, but the result is much better and more advanced than some other loosely -- other approach. Ben Schmidt : Okay. And on the growth investment, can you guys add just a little bit more to how much of the capacity has already been added? And how much you\u2019re expecting to add, I guess, how much more needs to be added for this year? And, can you remind us what the normal ramp time period is for new reps? Ken Xie : For the new rep, probably a little bit different for each second vertical, like the channel probably within a few months, like 3 months time frame, and then the enterprise probably 6 to 12 months [ph]. [Indiscernible] take like 1 to 2 years like that carry all the things. So, we\u2019re going to also like differentiate, I think based on how the pandemic, how the other progress going and also the market opportunity there. But, I\u2019d say, we do kind of plan into increase more capacity when we see more opportunity there and try to match the investment with -- I think whether the internal, like the new product and also the market opportunities, so definitely will help us keep driving the SASE growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Fatima Boolani : Ken, maybe I\u2019ll start with you. Just drilling into your vertical-based performance, you talked about the global government vertical being -- comprising a fifth of your billings in the quarter and that some of the highest levels we\u2019ve seen. And so, I\u2019m wondering if you can remind us what your U.S. public sector exposure is within that government exposure? And then, more specifically, how is Fortinet positioned, both from a product and go-to-market perspective in the U.S. federal, especially as we sort of think about the $10 billion cybersecurity spending protocol from the new Biden administration? And then, I have a quick follow-up for Keith. Ken Xie : Yes. The government business for Fortinet\u2019s global base, it\u2019s about 17% of our total business for us right now. And compared to like a few years ago, the carrier service provider is the number 1 is over 20%. Now, they are like 16%. For the U.S. government, we still see a lot of opportunity and the same thing for the U.S. market. And so, we\u2019re going to keep in building the team and increase capacity and to take this opportunity and grow faster and larger. What\u2019s the second question? Keith Jensen : I think, we\u2019ve talked before that the U.S. fed is low single digits of our government business -- of our business, nothing to add that. Fatima Boolani : Got you. Very helpful. Keith, just sticking to Americas, we saw a very nice acceleration in 4Q in the Americas theater, and against what was maybe an uneven geographical performance for the U.S. over the course of 2020. So I\u2019m wondering if you can just put a finer point on the types of things that went right and the types of things that really went on in the quarter, and the key drivers of the strength, particularly in the Americas. And that\u2019s it for me. Keith Jensen : Yes. So, I think a good question, but a lot of ways, different answers. If you look at geographically, Latin America continues to be, by far, the most challenged, if you will. Canada probably did the best of the three, and I would put the U.S. right in the middle. I do think that we\u2019re very pleased with how the U.S. has come back. The second quarter, now that we all are pandemic experts about what to expect out of the business and looking at Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. It\u2019s pretty obvious that -- and we kind of felt this coming out of the second quarter that Q2 was a low watermark, both for the Company in total, but also for the U.S. And I think you\u2019ve picked up on -- since that point, there\u2019s been a steady progression of, for lack of a better term, recovery in that part of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much. And congratulations to the entire Fortinet team on a great end to a great year. My first question for you, Ken, in your comments, you basically said that you aspire to be the market share leader in SD-WAN, which I think is a really important goal that you have. And I just was curious, from your perspective, what needs to happen to get there? How do you take share from your two largest competitors that have significant installed base relationships? And over what time can this play out? Ken Xie : I think, for us, we have a unique advantage of we build SD-WAN with security together, and we also leverage ASIC to like increase computing power, lower competing cost a lot. So, that\u2019s none of our competitors have not. And also the other two big leaders, they come from acquisition, that\u2019s where going forward, they probably will be slower on whether the innovation of the market change dynamic there. So, that\u2019s what you can see from the FortiOS 7.0 release. We did see the increased additional function, whether the SD-WAN, the 5G and other parts. So, we do also believe, going forward, like half or majority of the SD-WAN market will need security. So, we have a huge advantage there. So, that\u2019s where -- even have a bigger installation base, but the advantage we have from the product, from a function, from the cost side, I think will be huge, and what have us keeping driving the market share. And so far, like year-over-year, we almost doubled the SD-WAN business compared to the 2019 in the \u201820. Brad Zelnick : Great. And maybe just quickly for Keith. Keith, what are the levers to think about, in light of sales headcount, and the plans for this year? Keith Jensen : Brad, I\u2019m not quite sure I fully understand the question, but maybe I\u2019ll give it a shot and that to share one data point of coming into this year, if I look at the level of sales capacity we have versus what the plan is that we\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve -- this is as well positioned as we have been coming into a year to pivot towards this growth model that Ken has talked about. And I think that -- the pipeline feels very good. The tenure feels very good. The use cases, the TAM feels very, very good to us. The new FortiOS, the NP7 shift is coming out, the platform advantage, the cost advantage that we have for performance. I think that we are in a very good position to execute this. And again, we\u2019re maintaining it within the framework that we\u2019ve talked about previously. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : Just one question from my side. Ken, in your prepared remarks, I think, you talked about that the industry is finally raised, the customers move to consolidation on fewer vendors, more of a broad platform approach. With that in mind, where would you gauge the Fortinet platform and what are the areas that you would like to bolster to improve your position moving forward? Ken Xie : You can see that, like we call the security fabric has a pretty nice growth, almost double compared to the FortiGate growth there. That\u2019s also because customers want to have all these whole infrastructure secure integrated automated solution. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re continuing to see -- we\u2019re keeping gaining share there. So, that\u2019s involving probably 20, 30 different products. And on the other side, on the FortiGate part, we call the security-driven networking, that\u2019s whether the SD-WAN, the 5G and now with integrated SASE and some other part working closely with service provider carrier, we also see a lot of opportunity within the FortiGate side. So, that\u2019s where we see -- so far, we are keeping like -- if the market itself grows like 10%, we do see we can grow much faster than the market keeping gaining share. And both, on the FortiGate and also on the -- we call it, the broad fabric approach, which is involved in both the endpoint and the networking and the cloud altogether. And all this integrated together, based on the FortiOS and some under connectivity related to the FortiOS. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Ken, I just wanted to start on the focus more on growth comment and how you\u2019re investing some of your healthy margin and some sales and marketing initiatives. We also heard a similar message from a competitor yesterday. And just thinking about the broader industry implications of that an outsider could maybe make the case that we enter a period of greater industry competition and pricing pressure as major competitors are investing heavily in sales and marketing, certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be the case based on your full year margin guide. So, maybe some thoughts on why that scenario does not play out? Keith Jensen : Ken, can I jump in and answer on your behalf? I think, the reference probably is to a company that has a very, very different business model. Whether you\u2019re looking at growth rates or you\u2019re looking at product service mix or what have you. So, I don\u2019t know that that would draw that straight-line comparison. I think, the business model that we\u2019re executing here has been extremely successful, and I expect it will continue to be so. In terms of discounting, I think that there\u2019s days that I don\u2019t like carrying it, but we\u2019re view as being the price for performance leader, that our pricing is really -- we\u2019re oftentimes, I think, brought into RFPs and opportunities to set the milestone that the competitors are forced to react to as opposed to the other way around. If you go back and look at the comments that we\u2019ve offered throughout 2020, even in the pandemic, more often than not, discounting, if you will, has been a tailwind for us in our ability to execute against it as opposed to a headwind. And by that, I define discounting, mean lower discounting pressure in that quarter than the prior period. So, I don\u2019t think we have the concerns that may have been described there. Adam Tindle : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, Keith. And sorry, a little bit in the weeds on this one. But, the billings guidance for Q1, it\u2019s down about 20% sequentially at the midpoint and typically down low double digits or so, mid-teens in that range. Last year, at the start of COVID, it was down 17%. So, part of the question is, why would the sequential decline in billings be worse than the environment when we entered COVID, during Q1 of last year? You talked about having a strong pipeline, supporting the desire to invest. Maybe just some help with the color on the disconnect between those two items. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think one -- which you\u2019re talking about is just a tremendous performance in the fourth quarter of 2020. I know that 20 -- fourth quarter of 2019 was a good quarter, but Q4 2020 on top of that \u201819 performance, I think is part of it. And this is typically the smallest quarter for us in the year. Historically, you\u2019ve seen some sort of shift, and it\u2019s nothing new and from going from Q4 to Q1 and then you start to see the progression thereafter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman : Ken, I wanted to ask my first question of you. You\u2019ve talked about 5G. Why is that an opportunity? Who\u2019s your customer? And what -- why does Fortinet win in that instance of the deployment of 5G? And if you could just talk a little bit about when do you think that you\u2019ll get some benefits from this? Ken Xie : I think we do see 5G connect a lot of devices to the Internet, which also increased a lot of security risk. We call there\u2019s a new attack service, a new edge need to be covered. So, that\u2019s where especially, we\u2019re working with a lot of service providers for the 5G service to a lot of enterprise and connect all these different devices in the OT/IoT space. So that we do see as a huge opportunity. And so, with our position with the carrier service provider and we do see the 5G can be one of the driving -- growth driving factor for us this year and it could be material towards the end of the year. Going forward, it\u2019s also huge, huge opportunity, even secure whether -- it\u2019s part of the whole infrastructure, which grow very, very fast and a lot of our carrier service providers starting to have investment in this area also. Keith Bachman : Okay, interesting. Okay. And then, Keith, one for you. For the guidance of \u201821, you talked about CapEx. Any other puts and takes you want us to think about as it relates to OCF or operating cash flow? Keith Jensen : No, not really. I mean, I made the point about inventory. The turns came in for us pretty strong in the fourth quarter, but I think that\u2019s a direct reflection of the success that we had in the product revenue line in the fourth quarter. So that was probably a little bit better than we expected. I do think during this pandemic era that we\u2019ll continue to maintain somewhat higher levels of inventory. I think that\u2019s in our best interest. The extended payment term program, I think that every CFO wants to wind that down as fast as possible and every distributor wants to hold on to it for life. So, that will be an ongoing battle for us throughout 2021, I think. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Ben Bollin : My first question, you\u2019ve made your aspirations pretty clear in SD-WAN. Could you share with us a little bit about aspirations, intentions as you move into SASE and zero trust, how you see yourself positioned? Ken Xie : Yes. SD-WAN is a part of the SASE offering. What we do is a little bit different than competitors. We build within the FortiGate, FortiOS, which also can be offered, whether based on the physical price or the virtual software or kind of cloud delivering. And that\u2019s where the new FortiOS 7.0 gives all this flexibility and connects a lot of other part of infrastructure security service together. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll continue to see SD-WAN and keeping growing probably -- by much, it probably was keeping grown like 30%, 40% year-over-year this year. We do believe we\u2019re also keeping gaining market share. And at the same time, the 5G -- the other opportunities come up, we already offered in the new FortiOS 7.0, which also could be a pretty good driver for the additional growth we have. Ben Bollin : Could you also talk a little bit about how you envision FortiOS 7 rolling out, once available? How backwards compatible will it be for legacy appliances? And if you\u2019ve looked at some of the historical OS refreshes, how long does it take the footprint to roll over, as this rolls through the base? Thank you. Ken Xie : It\u2019s really dependent on customer. Some -- I have to say, the channel probably reacts a little bit faster and then there\u2019s enterprise, then the service providers sometimes take a little bit time. Because large service providers, they also have to support in some of that. But we do see this enables a lot of new opportunities. And they also like this tightly integrated approach, whether the SD-WAN, SASE, we call security driven networking, which do enable them to offer the additional service, additional kind of business and protect additional edge. That\u2019s why we say, you need to protect all different edge together and automate -- integrate together instead of have a different product, different kind of a vendor for each part, which is difficult to integrate and automate. So, that\u2019s where we see the response from like 300 new features and updates in this OS to cover quite a broad area. And that we do see customers do need some time to gradually like train, pick up on this new function. But, a lot of them, they see the huge benefit of this new function. And that\u2019s where we see, it\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. But probably towards the second half of the year, we\u2019ll see a lot of benefit of it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Eric Heath [ph] on for Michael. Just one for me. Keith, it seemed like you guided billings for 4Q, assuming some macro headwinds. How did that play out differently than you expected, especially on the product side? And in the end, did you see deferrals of hardware refreshes in 2020 that might snap back in 2021? Keith Jensen : Yes. We have such a long product list. I don\u2019t think that we really saw deferrals of refreshes, despite the asset concept. I think the -- I don\u2019t think Q4 was unusual in terms of what you normally see, with other years. And by that, I mean, I think, there was probably some element of the typical budget flush flowing through. I think, there was probably some element of salespeople working really hard to hit accelerators. And I think there was also some element of deals that simply pushed. I don\u2019t think that -- Ken kind of made a good point earlier to build on a little bit. I think, the solar wins event happened so late in the quarter, at least for us and probably for many other security companies. It seems doubtful that that activity really had much impact on the last two weeks of December in the quarter. I do think, and Ken made this point that it certainly raises awareness of security and events like that, unfortunately, for the world at large, keep focus on security that matters and the importance of it that people are going to suffer because of it. So, I don\u2019t know that in terms of learning to be cautious, if you will, going back to the beginning of your question and the guidance setting, I do think there was an element of caution, once we came out of the second quarter and saw how the dynamic impact close rates. And you saw that come through in the guidance setting process in both Q3 and Q4. Ken Xie : Also, we see a pretty nice growth in SMB, but overall, the SMBs still have very low percentage leverage, whether the network security or cybersecurity. That\u2019s where -- including retail. So that\u2019s where we see there\u2019s a -- still have a huge growth opportunity over there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. And congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe just starting with a high-level question. So, as we think about the mix of your revenue, do you think the SolarWinds attack will create a positive tailwind for more spending in the firewall market, or do you think it will pressure your product growth as customers perhaps shift spending towards some of your cloud-based and subscription solutions? Ken Xie : I said, probably they would drive to have a more integrated and bigger infrastructure security. So, that\u2019s where probably -- definitely, it\u2019s sort of when it\u2019s more like kind of come from the network side. On the other side, they are also trying to like cover what the pandemic is, whether it\u2019s work from home, there\u2019s a lot of other like business trying to digitalize during this process, which also increased the security need. That\u2019s why I say, the security spending kind of on the overall IT spending probably will keep increasing this year, and that\u2019s what\u2019s also helping drive. The SolarWinds is just like a few years ago, there\u2019s a case where the target and other things, definitely awareness of the importance of cybersecurity. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thanks, Ken. And then, just a follow-up. As we think about the growth phase you\u2019re entering here this year and your go-to-market strategy to drive that growth, if you look back over the last few years, your playbook has certainly been the lead with the firewall. I\u2019m just wondering in this new growth phase, are you using the same playbook to accelerate the growth, or are you seeing more deals come to you via your SIM products and your virtual solutions and your other subscriptions and perhaps changing your go-to-market strategy to drive that growth? Ken Xie : In the next few years, the network security market is still the biggest market, also probably the fast-growing market, not just because there\u2019s more connectivity, like 5G, SD-WAN and some other part, work from home, but also that\u2019s the center of the whole infrastructure security. But also, you cannot just -- to network security only, you also need to have network security working closely with endpoint, with some other infrastructure, cloud, some other parts together. That\u2019s why we call the integrated automated solution to respond to any of this quick changing dynamic industry here. That\u2019s where it\u2019s important, we keep the organic growth and we also keep -- develop the product on day one to make it integrated, automated together. It\u2019s a little bit different compared to competitor, which whether come from acquisition or some other parties is more challenging to integrate and also keep the innovation going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Gray Powell : Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on the good results. So, maybe circling back on the 5G questions. In past telecom upgrade cycles, maybe 3G was too long ago, but looking back at like the 4G upgrade cycle, how did that play through to Fortinet? What kind of tailwinds did you see then? And then, how does the 5G cycle feel in comparison? Ken Xie : Yes. Compared to 3G, 4G is more connect people, whether the phone, whatever, together, the 5G is more connect to the device. And that\u2019s also the number of connection probably will increase as it may be 10x at least, because there\u2019s much more devices to be connected, and that also kind of more addresses a lot of industry need, whether certain smart city or auto drive or a lot of bigger infrastructure. So that\u2019s -- we do see a lot of a business opportunity, because so far, the network security will be more towards B2B towards the business side compared towards the consumer part. That\u2019s we do see huge opportunity going forward. It\u2019s just like a couple of years ago, the SD-WAN, right? So, SD-WAN can help in drive a lot of smart connection with the application and more dynamic, based on application, have a different connection there. So that\u2019s where the 5G definitely has a lot of additional opportunity but also bring a lot of risk to the business there, which need to be protected. And also service provider, we see play quite important role there, which is we have probably the best service provider carrier relation among other cybersecurity vendors there. So we do see a lot of potential in this area. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Irvin Liu : I have one question and one follow-up. First, I was wondering if you can perhaps update us on your business mix by customer size, maybe a breakout by enterprise, commercial or SMB. And whether you\u2019ve seen a shift up or down market? And how do you see this mix trending through calendar \u201821? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think, we had a slide in our Analyst Day in November 2019 that basically answered one-third, one-third, one-third. And then, to explain it a little bit of MSSP gets allocated between them. But, you end up with something that\u2019s very, very much like that. Small business, small enterprise, one-third; mid, one-third; enterprise, one-third. I think, the thing that has been a very pleasant surprise to us throughout 2020 in the pandemic was how well the enterprise -- the small enterprise segment of the business held up. It really did very well. Irvin Liu : Got it. And for my follow-up, we\u2019re now one year into the current pandemic. And assuming things normalize in the back half of calendar \u201821, do you anticipate any changes or shifts in demand or customer buying patterns, assuming a return to normal environment? Ken Xie : I think, during the pandemic, the customer, especially enterprise customer turned to hold down to the current vendor, especially in the developed country. But it\u2019s -- but for us, like whether in the U.S. or some of these countries, we\u2019re keeping gaining market share. So, we do get into a lot of new customer, which will probably take more effort during the pandemic because it\u2019s difficult to meet people or do certain testing there. Once it\u2019s open, we do see there\u2019s more opportunity, more windows open for us, especially with the new hardware, new OS and the new infrastructure. So, that also leads us to kind of a little bit towards investing in the growth for us going forward in the next few quarters at least. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think, Ken is spot on with that. I think, quote unquote, nice thing about the pandemic is I think we have a lot of understanding about our business and what to expect in pandemic quarters. And I think that all of us here at Fortinet, and I think throughout the country are looking forward to, at some point in time, we need a vaccine and then the other gross drivers kick in, and that seems destined to be sometimes towards the second half of this year. I think, we\u2019re all very aware of some of those GDP numbers and the year-over-year swings that we\u2019re seeing from negative 3% to positive 6% or 7%. Those are pretty dramatic numbers. But, I think most people\u2019s expectations are that that\u2019s where they going to come when the economies and the countries start opening up further. Peter Salkowski : We\u2019re going to close the call at this point. As you read in today\u2019s press release, I\u2019d like to point out to everybody that Fortinet\u2019s Accelerate 2021 virtual conference will be held on March 9th for the U.S. As part of that conference, we\u2019ll be doing an Analyst Day. So, you can register, there\u2019s a link in the press release as well as up on the website to register for investors and analysts. So, please do that prior to March 9th, if you\u2019re interested in attending that morning event. In addition, we\u2019ll be hosting -- in addition to hosting Accelerate, we\u2019re also going to be attending the Goldman Sachs conference next week on February 10th and the Morgan Stanley conference on March 2nd. Links to those webcasts will be on our website available on the Investor Relations -- Investor Events page of our Investor Relations website. Thank you very much for your time today. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Peter Salkowski, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin sir. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Rowanda. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Speakers on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the first quarter, before providing guidance for the second quarter and updating the full year. We'll then open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call we will be making forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we make on today's call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thank you, Peter. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our first quarter 2021 result. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Billings increased 27% to $851 million, driven by solid execution across a broad and integrated product and services. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% to first quarter billing. Total revenue grew 23% to $710 million with product revenue growth of 25%, the highest quarterly product revenue growth in the last five years. With strong business momentum and great visibility, we've remained focused on growth. In the first quarter, we released FortiOS7.0, which offered the industry first OS label with tight integration of a broad security and network functions, including SASE, SD-WAN, Zero-Trust Network Access, CASB and 5G capability. Today we announced the 40 GIG 71.01 AF, the world\u2019s fastest next-generation firewall, and the only firewall with hyperscale 400 gig interface. The 71.01 AF will help 5G mobile network operators to secure multiple edges within their infrastructure and are enabled by MSPs to be with scalable security offerings. Powered by our new MP7 security process unit, the 71.01 AF delivers security contributing of 2x to 19x greater than comparative solutions. We continue to see momentum and adoption of our SD-WAN, SASE and zero trust network access solution among the world\u2019s largest service providers. Today, we announced Bridges Telecom, a new major secure SD-WAN service powered by Fortinet. In March Fortinet and AT&T announced the ability of a new managed SASE solution for enterprise customers. Increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a holistic platform approach, delivering integrated and automate security cover on-premise network, endpoint and cloud secure edge. The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cyber security platform, organically built on a broad and a huge set of networking and security technology designed to seamlessly operate together. The high-profile of security incidence that occurred over the past few months, along with the pandemic, has elevated the need for a broad platform that can secure an enterprise on target infrastructure across multiple edge in a zero-trust environment. We expect companies to increase the percentage of IT spending used for security in an effort to address their cyber security needs. Our security-driven networking approach, is a key growth driver. Additionally, we expect that our significant organic product growth will lead to increase the service revenue. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comment, we should note that billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth were each at five-year highs. Okay, let's start the more detailed Q1 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $710 million was up 23% driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 25%. Auto-driven growth was broad-based across geographies, Security Fabric products and use cases illustrating the market acceptance of our integrated, single platform, security strategy. Customer demand for security across their entire infrastructure and the diversity of our customer base. Product revenue growth was over 30% for both infrastructure and cloud fabric products. And all three geographic regions increased 20% or more. Demand for security fabric products was strong across all form factors, hardware, software, and virtual machines. The growth we experienced for product revenue was not the result of a few large deals, lower backlog or higher channel partner inventory levels. The product revenue growth also enables increases in services billings and future services revenue. In the first quarter service revenue of $470 million was up 22%. Support and related services revenue increased 23%, to $214 million. Security subscription services revenue increased 21% to $255 million benefiting from outsized growth from our cloud provider and SaaS security offerings. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and Non-FortiGate platform revenue, the FortiGate segment of the Fabric platform saw revenue increase 17% driven by demand for entry-level and high-end FortiGate products. High-end includes 10 new NP7 powered FortiGates that were introduced in the past week, which includes today's announcement of the 71.21F. These new products now represent approximately 20% of high-end FortiGate shipments. Our AC driven FortiGates give customers five to ten times more computing power than firewalls that run on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates not only speed, but also the capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, driving our price for performance advantage. The Non-FortiGate segment saw revenue grow over 40% and now accounts for 31% of total revenue up four percentage points. The integrated security fabric solutions, consists of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and professional software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors enabling integrated protection for hybrid environments and the expanding digital attack surface from the data center, to the endpoint, to the cloud. Given the strong first quarter performance \u2013 revenue performance, we believe our Non-FortiGate platform is now on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year, representing an acceleration of this milestone. Let's turn to revenue by geographies. As summarized on Slide 5, revenue in the Asia Pacific area increased 26%; EMEA revenue increased 25%; and Americas posted revenue growth of 20%. As I mentioned earlier, all three regions experienced product revenue growth of 20% or more. Moving to billings. The first quarter billings were $851 million, up 27%. We saw strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segments at a Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of 20%, accounting for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry-level FortiGate posted very strong billings growth in the quarter. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for 30% of total billings and delivered billings growth of 50%, driving a four-point year-over-year mix shift to non-FortiGate. Taking together, these data points highlight the market acceptance of our single integrated security platform strategy. In terms of billing growth by geos, APAC outperformed all geos followed by Europe, and the Americas. In the Americas, Canada had a very strong quarter and Latin America rebounded from the pandemic induced slowdown posted billings growth in the mid 20% range. Moving to billings by customer segments, the small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions, customer Security Fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse makeup of this international customer segment. At the same time, we saw strong growth in our larger deals. The number of deals of $1 million, increased 74% to 66 deals in the first quarter. The pipeline for deals of a $1 million looks good for the remainder of the year. As Ken noted, secure SD-WAN billings were 14% of total billings. SD-WAN as a key functionality and an integrated staffing solution. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals was another strong international performance. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at 19% of total billings and was up 60%. Service providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. The rebound for education accelerated. We've done this growth of 50%. Retail turned into a solid quarter with billing growth of 21%. Our strong and consistent billings and revenue performance over the past several years is testament to our geographic and customer diversity. The growing success with a single integrated security platform strategy and our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform drives our price or performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4, total gross margin improved 10 basis points to 78.9%. Product gross margin improved 120 basis points to 62.6% benefiting from lower direct product cost. The increase in product gross margin offsets the drag on total gross margins from the revenue mix shift driven by the strong product revenue growth and a gross margin \u2013 and the gross margin FX headwind [indiscernible] about 25 basis points. Operating margin for the first quarter increased 210 basis points to 24.5%, benefitting from the strong revenue performance in the quarter. The benefit from lower travel and marketing program expenses are approximately 100 basis points. It was more than offset by an operating margin headwind from foreign exchange of about 150 basis points. To end the quarter \u2013 we end the quarter with total head count of 8,615, an increase of 16%.  Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the first quarter came in at $264 million, up $22 million from the first quarter of 2020, despite a $24.5 million year-over-year increase in CapEx spending. We ended the year with total cash and investments of $3.1 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment grade debt issuance during the first quarter. The issuance followed our inaugural strong triple B credit ratings. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers as they experienced geo-specific economic challenges. As a result daily sales outstanding increased seven days to 81 days and in line with our expectations and reflecting our earlier decisions to provide geographically targeted extended payment terms. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, DSI was on the first quarter of 2021 decreased six days, as we saw early progress towards returning to pre-pandemic payment terms. Inventory turns declined to 2.1 times from 2.5 times, reflecting the efforts we took to mitigate supply chain risk, including increasing our inventory levels, starting earlier in 2020. We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through 2021. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $52 million, including $38 million related to construction and other real estate activity. We expect to begin moving employees and the new Sunnyvale campus building in the middle of the year. Although the timing will depend on local pandemic protocols and employee safety considerations. We estimate capital expenditures for second quarter between $30 million and $40 million for all of 2021 to between 150 and 179. The average contract term in the first quarter was approximately 27 months, up less than two months from the first quarter of 2020, and down approximately one month from the fourth quarter of 2020. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 15 deals of $1 million versus four in the first quarter of 2020, and contributed to the increase in average contract term. As we look forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities we highlighted during the March Analyst Day and as confirmed in our first quarter results, we have tilted our bias towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales capacity and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS7.0 operating system that was recently released. Now I'd like to review our outlook for the second quarter guidance summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $860 to $880 million. Revenue in the range of $733 million to $747 million. Non-GAAP gross margins of 78.5% to 79.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes an expected 100 basis points to 150 basis points headwind in foreign exchange. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.88, which assumes a share count of between $168 million and $170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before raising our 2021 guidance, I\u2019d like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding start to 2021. For the 2021 we expect billings in the range of $3.685 billion to $3.745 billion, which at the mid point represents growth of approximately 20%. Revenue in the range of $3.080 billion to $3.130 billion, which at the mid point represents growth of approximately 20%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.020 billion to $2.050 billion, which represents growth of approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of the guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in 2021 operating margin, despite an expected headwind from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 or $3.80, which assumes a share count of between $170 million and $172 million and about $0.07 per share impact in debt issuance. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. [ph] We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard work in these difficult and unique times. Now I'll hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and others to participate, we've got a fairly large queue today. So I'd like to get through everybody at least once. Towanda, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Rob Owens : Great. And thank you for taking my question. With one of other verticals in the media, seeing issues with chip shortages and some supply chain issues, is that sort of sneak into the security market relative to firewall point shipments. And can you talk a little bit about your potential exposure? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Well, I think the chip shortages \u2013 this is Keith, Rob. I think the chip shortages that you point out is can touch a lot of different industries. I think one thing about Fortinet in addition to having different form factors is the inventory balances that we carry, a two times inventory turns, you're looking at basically six months of inventory that we're carrying on our balance sheet. I do expect that the supply chain issues will be something particularly related to chips that will be a constant conversation points throughout 2021 and into 2022. But I think in terms of when we sit down and talk about our expectations for the year, I think we have a fairly good understanding of how to work that in. Rob Owens : Thanks, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you. And thank you very much for taking the question. Ken, I was just wondering, billings commentary worldwide government up 60%, some really nice acceleration there and then MSSP and service providers still 16% of total. May if you can talk about obviously we know what the secular drivers in MSSP are. How durable is that, maybe the factors that are driving that acceleration in government spend, and then maybe talk a little bit about particularly on the service provider side, it doesn't seem as though we're seeing an acceleration from 5G and IoT yet. Who are the buyers there? How do you anticipate that segment will play out through the rest of the year as you look your way through the remainder of the year? Ken Xie : Yes. Carrier on this a lot of service provider starting to now reshaping their \u2013 security network offer whether it's 5G, SD-WAN, all of the SASE and also supporting work from home kind of still in the early stage, I put in this way. So that's where we working very closely with all the service provider like the VG [ph] we announced today, the AT&T we announced last month and pretty much all the service provider to support and then all these shifting of the business model. And I say it's still early stage. We do involve a lot of testing trial. And at the same time, I do believe eventually the service provider business will go back up to the number one is tend to be like a high 20, like if you go back four, six years ago, but it's a \u2013 because it's a new kind of shifting, so they are \u2013 they do have some work to do and also some big investment we see going forward. So we're working together with them to keep growing this business right now. Brian Essex : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open. Jonathan Ho : Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to get a better sense of what you're seeing in terms of demand for the SASE and ZTNA oriented products. And are you seeing that pipeline sort of continued to rise especially as we look at sort of replacements for the traditional VPN connections and other sort of more legacy technologies? Thank you. Ken Xie : Yes, that is the new fast growing market, but also they probably replace some of the traditional approach, but some other traditional approach also expand inside campus, inside \u2013 and probably inside the data center, so that go through the internal segmentation. On other side, we do believe we entered the SASE zero trust network like we said few years ago it's the best position probably saw the service provider carrier. So we tend to be more working with them, partner with them and also offer kind of more tighter integrated solution like we said in the FortiOS7.0 is very integrate OS network inside of some different vendor using different box, so you can kind of look at different inputs factors to that. So that's actually working much better with a wider service provider with customer directly. So that's where we do see there are some fast growing going forward, but it's just part of the whole infrastructure solution will now replace the traditional approach, but also the whole thing\u2019s security is smarter than that dynamic space, there is a new team come up and also the \u2013 that alternatives also not goes away. So that's where we try to address is a new chain and same time keeping at hands the traditional solution and to supporting the customer in all different vertical different region. Jonathan Ho : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Good evening, Ken, Peter \u2013 Keith, Peter. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you see customer discussions changing or evolving as they contemplate and start to return to their offices and to work. And then also hoping you could touch on how you view the growth opportunity over time from completely new customers versus wallet share expansion with your existing customers? Thanks. Ken Xie : The customer doesn't view security, become more and more important, but also they need to cover much broad infrastructure and all edges instead of as a traditional secure whatever the border or the data in other company. So that's more device, more user, more infrastructure need to be covered. So that's \u2013 it's not a simple refresh. It's really a change into the whole infrastructure approach and also working together with traditionally negative from vendor cover, whether now working on end point as a mother part of a security. Now they're looking for some consolidation and they prefer, when they have multiple cover of a different part of infrastructure working together. So that you can see that the fabric approach we did a few years ago starting doing quite well and almost pretty much every quarter double the growth compared to the traditional network security. But now what they created, we also see more healthy growth and it\u2019s really not as expanding beyond the traditional border security approach, but also because the ASIC advantage, which increased the secure computing power 5 to 10 times compared to that the other vendors software loaded on the traditional CPU. So that\u2019s able to add a more function and also kind of increase performance, lower the cost, and also a low car park assumption, more green. So that that\u2019s actually making that this like the product worlds like we say that keeping us, keeping to better and better. And that we do see this whole infrastructure approach will keeping going for the next, probably a few quarters even to a few years. And the consolidation will keeping going within the industry. Keith Jensen : Yes, then I would just continue on with Ken\u2019s comments. I think the headline that he\u2019s talked about previously is that the back to work really the combination of back to work and many companies being in a hybrid model that the attack surface now seems to be permanently expanded for many, many companies. In terms of growth in how we see it with new logos and expansion opportunities, we easily add several thousand new customers every quarter. But if you look at the mix of billings, the mix of billings is going to come from our installed base of customers, if you will. And I think the simple model we\u2019ll look at is, from that initial sale of perhaps a firewall or something else. There\u2019s two different ways to expand. One is finding more and more use cases inside organizations for firewalls and increasingly displacement opportunities. And then the second is, and this is where Ken was going is the expansion opportunity where those non-FortiGate fabric partner products. And we\u2019re seeing there with that that mix shift from FortiGate to non-FortiGate, and now being 30% of our business, 31% of our business. I think it\u2019s taking as one affirmation of the strategy and two, you\u2019re seeing it in the numbers. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hi guys, I\u2019m going to take you to the basics with my question. Last year was strong and there was some concern that the firewall market is being driven by a COVID-related demand, just because of work-from-home. And the question is whether you expect any slowdown of demand related to the anniversary of the trends last year. And the second question is your non-FortiGate grew extremely strong again. If you can take us through the basics, what are the products that are growing there? Just what are the trends and what do you bring to the market? Thanks. Ken Xie : I can take the first part, maybe Keith got second half. I don\u2019t see any slowdown even for the FortiGate side. It is \u2013 we\u2019re keeping gain in market share, like I said because there\u2019s a fundamental like a technology architecture difference with 5 to 10 times the computing power compared to our competitor we can easily add a function performance and even for work-from-home is more like a one single with the box and replace like a three, four different box on an helping that security side, like of these apart, and also like manage home Wi-Fi and the traffic there. So that\u2019s also lot of company also starting to this kind of expand the branch to the home called home branch or whatever to meet working standard like a better networking, reliability, security to the whole environment. So that\u2019s also need to be the solution. That\u2019s also lot of the reason we see some of the low asset and keeping grow pretty fast. It\u2019s a look for a home actually helping driving some of this point of your sales. But also going forward whether the service provider some other after say most enterprise, not even kind of a change might after infrastructure to adapt is more work-from-home yet. They are still in the early stage. So we do see there\u2019s a big potential going forward. Yes, that\u2019s all, Keith. Keith Jensen : Yes. Well, it\u2019s a little tough for me to look back at the second quarter of last year and where their billings growth was and the product revenue grew up and things that I was getting. I didn\u2019t feel like I was getting a tailwind from VPN or something like that in the second quarter of last year. That said I think we\u2019re very pleased with how the year continued to play out and in the growth numbers that we\u2019ve provided. I don\u2019t know that, early on in the stages of work from home, but that was something that necessarily Fortinet participated in to the same level of maybe some of the other firewall vendors did. And then the second part of your question you'll be glad to know that Ken and Peter and I sit down every quarter and look at the fab and the non-FortiGate products and try and find the one that's really distinguishing itself. And we keep coming to the same conclusion each quarter. It's a rising tide lifting all boats. If not that any one product is really standing out more so than the other over an extended period of time. Ken Xie : Yeah, it's really because most of the part that we develop internally from day one, it's making integrate operate together. So that's probably the key number one reason, customer want to buy is \u2013 we tried to consolidate, make it easier to manage. It's different than some other company when they acquire some part of our company from outside is that take a long time and more difficult to integrate. So we have internally developed from day one. We've been making working together. Tal Liani : Right. So, my question was much more basic, what are the key products that are driving up the growth of non-FortiGate? So we know it's SD-WAN, what else? Ken Xie : I see what I think the part of FortiGate. Tal Liani : Got it. Yes. Ken Xie : So we don\u2019t comment on non-FortiGate, but is we have like 20, 30 given product, touch all part of the infrastructure and the key said is difficult to point out which one is ready. Yes, it\u2019s a [indiscernible] I read the whole thing. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering if you could help me better understand the disproportionate improvement that you saw internationally, especially in EMEA relative to the improvement you saw in the U.S.? Ken Xie : I think similar like we comment in the last couple of quarters, it's a photo there like pandemic, once is starting get improving, also try to think about how to go back [indiscernible] mother. You mentioned infrastructure since we'll be studying across. So that's where like APAC [indiscernible] it'd be faster by U.S. catch up however quickly. Keith Jensen : I'll just add on to that. Sterling, I think the \u2013 certainly for us that the markets are somewhat different. And maybe that comes into play a little bit, the European, the international part of the market. We are oftentimes you'll have the number one market share when the incumbent and particularly during the pandemic, I think incumbents have an advantage. I think in the U.S. perhaps we're a bit more of a challenger if you will. And I don't know that, a lot of CIOs and CTOs were focused on firewall refreshes in the second quarter and third quarter of last year and going through a competitive dynamics. And I think there's also a bit of the partner ecosystem. When you're the incumbent, you probably have more mind share with the partners. Then when you do with the challengers. Now, having said all that as we look forward, and we look at our pipeline, particularly in relation to the United States, as we go to the end of the second quarter here through the rest of the year. I think we're feeling very good about the direction of that organization is headed. Ken Xie : Yes, we also will keeping your mass more into the U.S. for supporting further growth like we did for the PGA sponsorship and some things I think will be helping drive the growth in the U.S. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Your line is open. Gray Powell : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good numbers. So, yeah, maybe to follow up on the SASE side of the business. How quickly should we think of billings growth ramping under 40 SASE product, and then I don't want to get too aggressive, but could it potentially have a similar ramp to what you saw in 2018 and 2019 with SD-WAN back when that product was just getting started? Just how should we think about \u2013 just the overall upsell there. Thanks. Ken Xie : I also, I can say a little bit similar question. We also kind of look at different market study and also what's the best model to do this with a partner together. I feel maybe similar like SD-WAN, but it's \u2013 but also SD-WAN is a part of the \u2013 part of a SASE solution and also SASE including some other function there, which we also want to have a like a better integration and better performance and that you need to manage. So that's where we take some time to launch our SASE and also more closely working with partner to do that. But it's a \u2013 the market definitely growing, but we also closely watching and what's the best way to position ourselves to catch the trend. Gray Powell : Okay. Thank you very much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Cowen . Your line is open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen, congrats on a strong performance. Keith or Ken historically the refresh cycle concert used to provide some disruption at times. I would even say some noise around specifically for in its business. It would appear that over the past, probably 18 months or so. There's less discussion and focus around it. Do you think that Fortinet is gradually shifting away from it or is that there's so many concurrent internal refresh cycle given the broadening of your platform, that it is becoming less of a relevant issue? What's the thinking about it? Ken Xie : I probably hesitate to use some upper refresh compared to last time, you can see that 2012, 2013. And that's where it's the major firewall replacing the traditional firewall VPN, which was [indiscernible] firewall has them intrusion prevention, and anti-virus all the other functions. They're a proxy. But this time it's expanding into a much broader, bigger infrastructure both internal inside the company, and also go to the outside company that one side even expand work from home.  So it's more kind of expanding and same kind of different part of security also need to be more working together. So that's from company IT side, they look \u2013 if they can consolidate and help them to manage and integrate, automate will be more important. So that's where like I said, there's a multi-wise, more people connected and like a [indiscernible] it's a little bit different and that's where making \u2013 make a large, broad integrated approach, I feel is more important and same kind of supporting that than you technology that what are five GSP when, and also kind of, they be service model also would be, would be important, but we also feel once the product at, in the customer hand because the huge computing power to liquidity, we can also be add additional servers and keeping helping customers adopt the nuisance they need, and also be a service provider. So that that's also kind of keeping that the biggest \u2013 keeping growing in general. Keith Jensen : I think you and Ken are kind of touching on same thing with, even in reference to, I would say it this way, it's going to get harder and harder. I think to discern industry refresh cycles, it compared to where it was maybe five or six, seven years ago for a number of reasons. One, the firewall vendors are simply larger. Their footprint is much, much bigger than it was before. Secondly, you have some of us sort of showing success on the platform strategy, when 30% of your billings are coming from the platform, again, to your point, it's going to get a little harder to discern it and the sheer size, if you will as the footprint in terms of customers, but also the number of different used cases that are starting to evolve and continue to evolve inside those organizations. I think all that comes together, it's going to get murkier and murkier ready to go forward, to find a refresh cycle. You may have some individual competitors that maybe have very, very large price points or machines or something like that, where they have their own internal refresh cycle that you may see some noise around, but that's really not the Florida approach for firewall refreshes. Ken Xie : The traditional firewall all the way they are rarely being deployed. It's not going away. They also kind of, every five years probably need to be updated to the new motto to match and that working speed as a modern one, but they also expanding beyond that one and also need to be walking, not out of a security infrastructure, putting this way. Shaul Eyal : Understood. Thank you so much. Well done. Ken Xie : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond. James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe one for Keith, you've talked about this being a year to invest for growth. Your Q1 results clearly say that's working billings growth in high 20s at a scale approaching $1 billion and doing that with healthy profit is pretty unique. So, for my question, I was just wondering at this point, if you evaluated whether to lean even more on growth, given the early results that you're seeing?  And if you could maybe touch on the logic of why not are there diminishing returns above this level, is this something you would consider reevaluating as the year progresses? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes, Adam, it sounds like you are listening in to some of the conversations that Ken and I have with our respective point of view, I think. I think we're really pleased with how the business executed in the first quarter, putting up 27% billings growth and being 11 to 12 points above, and then raising the 22%, 3.5 points on the billings line for the year, probably for the quarter and then taking the year up at the same time by about four points, I think, the level of execution is shown to be very, very high. And the level of success with the firewalls and the Non-FortiGate products have been \u2013 we\u2019re very, very pleased with what's happening there. I think we'll see how this year plays out. We felt that there were tailwinds coming into the year for us at a number of different ways, whether it was GDP, whether it was stimulus, whether it was the product suite that we had, or our sales team's ability to execute. And let's see how we do as we continue on this trajectory, hopefully through the rest of the year. Adam Tindle : Thank you. That's fair enough. I'd love to be a fly on the wall for those conversations. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. And congrats on another great quarter. I want to ask about the partnerships with some of the MSPs that you mentioned AT&T and BT. Those have been historically strong partnerships for Zscaler. So, I'm wondering do you think you are eating into these Zscaler\u2019s mind share at those partners or are they just trying to offer their customers maybe another SASE offering? Ken Xie : Let us say, in the last few years for some point we used Zscaler as one of the service providers could be partnered. But also, some of the telecom companies, they do have their infrastructure and also some of their customer base, which we have been working with them for a long, long time. So, once, especially during the pandemic, IT has been in a high pressure to supporting whether internal or some other need being interesting. That\u2019s where SASE offers sort of more service-based approach which also kind of adopt based on [indiscernible] service provider quickly. So that's where we also leverage all kinds of relation with the partner and also our product technology, and vendors and offer much tighter, integrated SASE across network solution. Some bigger telecom partner they like it a lot, I put in this way.  So that's why we're continuing to work with them. So I do believe the business in the carrier service provider, when we go back to the number one like a few years ago, the high 20 that also have to work in closely with a partner and also some other infrastructure, a new infrastructure, I can mention whether the SD-WAN and the 5G or some other mode of IoT OT or even may be SIPG, or some other thing. I think there's a lot of potential which will result, how can a service provider do keep expanding the security business together. Andrew Nowinski : Yes, it sounds good. Thanks a lot, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Irvin Liu with Evercore. Your line is open. Irvin Liu : Ken congrats on the great quarter. You previously identified, continued expansion into large enterprise as a key contributor to growth in share gains. Can you talk about whether this was a factor in your Q1 outperformance? And also, can you also talk about any key differences when selling to large enterprises versus SME, S&D customers, for example, the go-to-market motion and/or timetable required to close a deal? So, any color here, will be helpful. Thanks. Ken Xie : Yes, I think we try to give a little bit of color on that in the script, and I've used the term before that the growth being bookend if you will. Through the pandemic, you have quarters where SMB did well. And I think we provided some metrics there about large deals, deals over $1 million, which we think is a pretty good proxy for the success that we're seeing in the enterprise. I do think also the mid-segment is coming online for us a little bit stronger than maybe we saw in 2020. And we continue to believe that 2020 was an unusual year, both geographically and across customer segments. In terms of the cadence, in terms of how to sell the enterprise versus SMB, I would say absolutely, you make a large investment and it plays very well with the channel partners. There's no doubt about that the MSSPs, the carriers, et cetera. And in those channel partners oftentimes, particularly distributors, play a role in the enterprise. But to be successful there, you absolutely have to have a direct sales force that is helping to bring deals to those channel partners. And I kind of made a comment earlier about incumbency versus challenger. I think that's perhaps even more important than the geography where you're the challenger and you're trying to get mind share from some of those large key resellers that are linked together with some of the legacy firewall vendors. I mean, you've really got to partner with them, to bring deals to them and convince them with that strategy. And I think we're starting to see that track and take hold for us. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Your line is open Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. Keith for you, I was hoping you could share some more details around the expectations of the SD-WAN mix that you have embedded in your guidance. How should we think about that? And certainly, how are you thinking about it? And where are the incremental areas of budgets or dollars and ultimately share gains within SD-WAN/SASE going to come from between the carrier market, as well as the enterprise DIY market? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think \u2013 hi Fatima, nice to hear from you again. I think in terms of SD-WAN, the way we go to our budget and we would describe SD-WAN as you heard us before, SD-WAN is a use case for the firewalls, similar to OT micro-segmentation, zero trust, et cetera. And we're not necessarily prone to building our models, if you will, by used cases for the firewalls, nor similarly necessarily by products. We do look at our pipeline and we do sanity check against Gardner projections for growth and things of that nature to make sure that we're in the range, if you will. So, I would expect that. The other comment I would offer is Ken has been quite clear for setting the goal early on, that he wanted SD-WAN to be 5% of billings. And we got there and he moved it to 10%. And we got there and now he has moved it to 15%. So, it's a little bit of movement cheese, I guess for Ken, in terms of setting goals for us. But that's fine. We like that. And I think you really kind of answered your own question in terms of growth investments. Where we would spend money, I think, that carrier service provider opportunities for both SD-WAN and SASE are key areas for those investments. But I'll hand it back to Ken. Ken Xie : Yes, I do believe SD-WAN will be a bigger, long-term market and we want to be the number one. And also like we do see a lot of potential even this work-from-home lot of enterprise had to do a lot of service provide [indiscernible], still where small percentage were early stage to using the SD-WAN. So that's where \u2013 and also, we have huge advantage using our SoC4 chip to supporting this like one-box solution which has about 20 times better performance and a much lower cost compared to the second nearest competitor. So that's where is there huge opportunity with the best technology and working closely with a partner towards keeping growing SD-WAN. So we do see there\u2019s a huge potential. And we are also trying to be the number one soon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hamza Fodderwala : Hi guys, good evening. And thank you for taking my question. I was wondering on the core sort of firewalling side, how much of the demand are you seeing come from used cases around micro-segmentation, particularly given some of these recent cyberattacks? Ken Xie : We do have a lot of asking about how to secure internally whether within ourselves and company are obviously in the data center. But I have to say security still need a maximum company in power to process the traffic compared to large solution. My estimate probably usually it\u2019s 3,000 5,000 ton more company power needed. That's where so if we cannot solve that speed issue was a major other kind of a managed deployment, you show is still more difficult. That's also the AC takes more advantage may be five to ten times better performance computing power and then pass lower than other software-only approach. So, it's a lot of requests, but I have to say, it's not many solutions can need summer requests, because internal, whether with in a campus or within a data center, the network speed tend to be easily 10 to 100 times more faster than the one approach. I mean, the one connection. So that's where we are working with the customer or the partner directly. And also combined both the WAN security, and the LAN security and the whole infrastructure security is more important. But with today work-from-home with the Zero-Trust Network Access you have to be, make the whole infrastructure secure.  So, I see a huge market potential for the internal segmentation inside data center of campus security, but it\u2019s also a challenging job to meet a speed requirement, compared networking and also make sure it can easily be deployed and easily managed. Hamza Fodderwala : Thank you for the color. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my question here, guys. Keith, maybe for you just going back to the Non-FortiGate part of the business, do you see any trends in perhaps market segment or geography that is adopting Non-FortiGate at higher rates? And I only ask that because with the growing enterprise business, with your growing enterprise business, that is, I would imagine more of the enterprises would maybe be more willing to work with multiple specialist vendors. So is Non-FortiGate part of the business, perhaps more weighted towards the mid-market or perhaps international? And relatedly, just kind of broad brush is how is that Non-FortiGate business sort of split between products and services? Sorry, there's a lot there. Does that make sense? Keith Jensen : Yes, there is a lot there. And answering no from me makes sense. How is that? Look I don't think the product service mix between \u2013 we would look about this and talking about previously, the FortiGate versus non-FortiGate, the product service mix is not different in any meaningful way, if you will, when you look at the mix. And again, we're selling solutions, so you're typically bundling that with a firewall cell. To see the Non-FortiGate billings, growth at that 50% number and seeing that the mix of the business, I think, obviously makes us very excited. It's actually a little bit counter-intuitive in terms of where itself. For the last several quarters the Americas has done very, very well with selling the Fabric. And I've been on phone calls with very large enterprises that want to know much more about the Fabric. Now that they've become comfortable with the firewall. I probably went into those conversations socket with much of the same expectation that you perhaps described, which is, that may be something that plays more to the SMB part of the business side of big enterprise. And I do think it does. I do think the enterprise willingness and in the U.S. you see the enterprise willingness to engage on the Fabric was probably a sign of a number of things. One is, at the end of the day, everybody has got a budget and this is a more cost-effective way to go about doing it. You can manage your infrastructure much easier perhaps with a single vendor strategy than you might otherwise. And I think the common operating system running on it or being integrated to OS/7 is something that's very exciting. And then you start talking to the vision about a SASE offering that\u2019s running on an integrated OS7 system, as well. So, I gave you a lot there. But to give color to it, I think, the long-winded response would be, it is not shown to be unique to a size of customer or to a geography. Saket Kalia : That makes sense. Thanks, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our net question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : Thank you very much. I'm going to follow-on Saket. and I have one question to keep within Peter's rules, but I'm going to break it into a couple of sub parts. On the non-FortiGate side as well. I wanted to break it into : a) is there anything over the next 12 months that you look at, that you think in particular is interesting or exciting? b) Keith, is there anything you could breakout on attach rates, where you currently stand on the non-FortiGate side to attach rates? It would seem to me that there's still a hell of a lot of room to run there. Just if you look at your installed base where some opportunities.  And then c) if you had to partition the non-FortiGate into cloud and non-cloud in other words, there's a lot of, I think, FortiGate products that are relevant to on-premise situations versus cloud, but there's a way to just kind of break it out in percentage dollar wise, 50% of it's aligned to on-premise deployments versus 50% is cloud deployments. Is there any way to break that out in the non-FortiGate side in particular? Thanks very much. Ken Xie : Yes, charging by the question, I think, I am going to look forward to you. Keith Jensen : Then I'm broke. I think there was \u2013 I'm going to lead that the tough question or the fun question for Ken at the end which is, if you look out over 12 months, what's going to take off in non-FortiGate. Keith, I would probably point you back to if we didn't do it in Analyst Day in March, we didn't do it in the Analyst Day in November 19, where we gave some breakdown of the Fabric products between what we call cloud and what we call infrastructure. And you can think of that as being hardware to me help answer your question there. I think when you use the term attach rate, we may use the term penetration rate. Keith Bachman : Yes. Keith Jensen : And by that is, for a customer that's a firewall vendor, how many \u2013 or as you start looking at your expansion opportunity Keith inside these customers, what type of penetration are you seeing and how are you going to market, if you will, and encouraging the sales team and the marketing team to whatever that number is increasing the penetration. And I would say that's something that's really been an area of focus, I would say, for us more recently over the last couple of quarters. And I think that's really at the moment more of we're pleased with it, don't get me wrong. But I think right now that's more of an internal metric that we're using with our sales team and our marketing team. And to some extent with our engineering team. Ken Xie : Yes, great. I think also I probably not go to detail outside of number so far the non-FortiGate almost doubled FortiGate world in the last few years or so. I don't see any changing of the trend right now. But definitely from customer end goal it\u2019s a \u2013 they also asked what's the reason they really need to be more consolidate, make the whole infrastructure managers working together, all this kind of things, which are working quite well with us because we design the product. [Indiscernible] we are working 40 gig from day one. And then making a whole fabric working together to integrate, automate, all the security solution there. So that's where the \u2013 but also we see there's still small percentage customer has [indiscernible] to grow and the same time there's a new productivity coming up to working with 40 gig. So that's where we do see \u2013 we probably keep the trend, the non-FortiGate will keep and grow faster. And probably eventually even the business, maybe more than 40 gig, maybe in a few years. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Michael Turits : Hey guys. For Ken and Keith do you see any difference in the type of projects, in security that you were seeing last year, primarily for the move to work-from-home versus this year, or we've worked from home as well as back-to-office? And as part of that, Keith, you mentioned, I think, saying that you are seeing, I think, some more willingness to do firewall replacements this year. Is that also a part of it? Ken Xie : Yes, last year work-from-home is more like a patch, whatever they have. And without changing much of infrastructure this is definitely thinking, redesigning infrastructure where to leverage make a better technology like SD-WAN or some other, and at the same time making kind of a better solution in a zero-trust environment that\u2019s much more secure. So that's probably \u2013 but still in the early stage. We do see a lot of our gross potential there. But it's whole infrastructure changing compared to kind of last year, quicker like a patch solution. Keith Jensen : Yes, Michael, I would add to Ken's comments. I think the headline is whether the tailwinds coming to your security is top of mind for so many companies right now, so many CIOs and SIOs and whether that's solo wins, or it's work-from-home it was Microsoft, a little challenge is to ramp up a ransomware. It's just \u2013 it's a year, I think, that a lot of CIOs and SIOs are focused on security for a lot of different reasons. I do think that there was \u2013 for us in the U.S. market, if you will, and Ken has talked about this before, a little more difficult to say in the middle part of last year, it's kind of a year to get mind share from CIOs and SIOs to have a conversation about how you can save money while improving performance in their firewall. I think those opportunities are starting to appear more in terms of getting out and having customers take their prospects, take that meeting if you will. And I think there's also, some of these larger deployments that can go on for, well over a year or a couple of years, I think, some of those deployments, perhaps were a bit stalled if you will, last year and they are coming back online as we look at 2021. Michael Turits : So just to clarify, larger deployments are starting to come back online. And so is that the answer that people are more willing to talk about displacements of competitors this year than last year? Keith Jensen : Is it the answer to which \u2013 are you asking if I'm seeing that the answer is yes, or you\u2019re asking if that's the driver of the business, I would say yes; if you're asking if that's be driver of the business, I don't think so. Michael Turits : No, just if you see more. Keith Jensen : Yes. Ken Xie : Yes, there are more spend beyond the traditional deployment. And also like a more device, multiple and more infrastructure need to be secure. Michael Turits : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Patrick Colville : Thanks for squeezing me. Can I just kind of just finish it off on a multi-part? I guess the first one would be just about linearity. Last year, the linearity between one and two is a kind of unusual. So just help us understand how that might play out in fiscal 2021? And then I guess my kind of second part, if I may is, product revenue, this quarter was phenomenal. Baked into guidance, I guess, there's a kind of the rest of the year is more like a kind of mid-teens growth rates. Just to help us understand, is anything that is worth flagging in regards to the kind of performance in the rest of the year versus 1Q? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think that, if you get comfortable with the business model, you understand the product and services and how very predictable that higher margin services revenue is. I think that we did take this as the opportunity to raise product revenue. We implied product revenue guidance, if you will, when you reverse engineer after we give the service revenue guidance by about five points. And I think that takes you to about 17% in terms of our guidance now for the full year. And we'll see how the year plays out. I think we feel good about it. In terms of linearity from Q1 to Q2, I would probably point you to one of our actual results that we had last year in Q1 and Q2. And our actual results in Q1 of this year and our guidance for Q2. Patrick Colville : That's very clear. Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. I will now like to turn the call back over to Peter for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Rowanda. I like to thank everyone for joining the call today. Fortinet will be attending a few conferences in the second quarter, we have the J.P. Morgan Conference on May 25, Alliancebernstein on June 2, and Bank of America is June 8. Presentations and webcasts links are up on our website. Thank you very much. Have a great day. And please reach out if you have any other questions. Have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding second quarter 2021 results. Billings increased 35% to $961 million, driven by solid execution and was the best it has been since 2015. Secure SD-WAN contributed 14% of second quarter billings. Total revenue grew 70% to $801 million with product revenue up 41%. Product revenue growth was the highest for nearly 10 years. Free cash flow was $395 million a quarterly level. With strong business momentum we remain focused on growth. Today we have announced expansion of our FortiCare and FortiGuard security services, adding a new security service called FortiTrust. FortiTrust security service offer user base licensing that follow the user across the organizations and high security platform. This enables organizations to easily manage and secure across all networks, endpoint and cloud, which traditionally has been siloded [ph]. Initial service level have been offered for Zero-Trust Network Access, and identity modifications. We have the current FortiCare security services which cover all Fortinet security fabric product with two-level services to include 24 x 7 technical support and timely insurance revolution. Additionally, FortiGuard security service has been [indiscernible] for different segment with added individual services for enterprise found those for commercial and the packages for SMB. Not only just an industry leading AI enabled security [indiscernible] that is regularly adjust protection across the FortiGuard security fabric. Today we announced a new FortiGate - 100F the industry's first high performance next generation firewall, with [indiscernible] Zero-Trust network access and advanced number of protection powered by the Fortinet NP7 [indiscernible] SPU the sigaoffers an average two times more performance than other competitive products based on our security [indiscernible]. These make the full apps the best protection for high speed internal network [indiscernible] centers. You can even see the momentum and the adoption of our SD-WAN [indiscernible] across network access and cloud solutions among the world's largest service providers. In May Fortinet was recognized as the winner of the Microsoft Security [indiscernible] type award. Lastly, Fortinet has named Google Cloud's 2020 Security Partner of the Year, recognized for innovative thinking, outstanding customer service, and benefiting process of a car product and services. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employee, customer and partners worldwide for their continuous support on our work. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comments, we should note that as of the prior quarter, billings growth, product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially. In fact, all three growth rates were five-year Fortinet highs and product revenue growth was at its highest in over nine years. Okay let's drive through more detailed Q2 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $801 million was up 30% driven by industry leading product revenue growth of 41%. The product revenue growth was broad based across geographies, FortiGate and non- FortiGate products, and across the use cases, illustrating market acceptance and customer demand through our integrated, single platform security fabric strategy across our customer infrastructures. Our financial strategy includes a rule of 40 target. The target the total of the revenue growth percentage and operating margin to be at least 40 and the second quarter strong demand and execution drove this actual total to be a rule of 55. FortiGate product revenue growth was 40%, while we continue to see robust growth from our secure SD-WAN functionality. Majority of the growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities which are embedded in the FortiGate operating system. Non- FortiGate product revenue growth was over 40% for the second consecutive quarter and was driven by strong growth from our integrated security fabric products. One additional comment on our product revenue growth, the product revenue growth was a reflection of our continued strong organic growth and not the result of a few large deals, drawing down backlog, nor unusual number of delayed transactions from the prior quarter or pulled in from future periods. Service revenue of $503 million was up 24%. Support from related services revenue of $230 million was up 26%, while security subscription services revenue of $273 million was up 23%. Moving to the mix of FortiGate and Non-FortiGate platform revenue, FortiGate product and services revenue increased 26% driven by very strong demand for both branch and high-end FortiGate products. High end products included 10 NP7 powered FortiGates models, representing approximately 25% of high-end FortiGate shipments. Our ASIC driven FortiGates give customers five to ten times more computing power than firewalls running on common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates additional speed and capacity to continue to add functionality to our operating system, further driving our price for performance advantage. The combination of the ASIC advantage and the common operating system across products, can enable vendor consolidation, lowering total cost of ownership, and increasing automation. Non-FortiGate products and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over two percentage points. The integrated security fabric consists of a complete range, [indiscernible], bit of a reversal for our advanced meeting later on today folks, so you've got an inside scoop on what Patricia is going to say. Let me start again if I may. Non- FortiGate product and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue for over 2 percentage points. The Integrated Security fabric consists of a complete range of form factors, and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and professional software, as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for the hybrid environments, and the expanding digital attack surface from network data centers to endpoints to the cloud. Let's turn to revenue by geo. To summarize, on Slide 5, revenue in EMEA increased 34%. The Americas revenue increased to 29% and APAC posted revenue growth of 24%. Product revenue growth for both the Americas and EMEA regions was over 40%. Moving to billings. Second quarter billings were $961 million up 35%. We saw a strong growth in both the FortiGate and non-FortiGate segment of the Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered billings growth of over 30%, accounting for 71% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, branch and high end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. The non-FortiGate segment accounted for over 29% of total billings and delivered billings growth of over 45%, driving a 2-point mix shift to non-FortiGate products and services. Given the continued strong performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year. Secure SD-WAN billings represented 14% of total billings, and is a key functionality for an integrated SASE solution. In terms of Billings by geo, EMEA outperformed all geos, followed by the Americas and APAC. Europe had a very good quarter and growth in the Americas was driven by the United States, which was up sequentially by more than 30 percentage points. Latin America continued to recover from the pandemic induced slowdown, posting billings growth in the mid 20s for the second consecutive quarter. The average contract term was approximately 28 months, up two months from the second quarter of 2020 and one month in the first quarter of 2021. Deals of over $1 million increased from 59 to 79, and the pipeline for deals over $1 million continues to look good for the remainder of the year. Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased from 13 to 19. Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Billings by vertical illustrate the diversification in our business model, and importantly, suggest the current threat landscape is driving security investments in industries that may have historically shown lower investment levels. For example, the verticals that have historically not been in our top-five combined for billings growth of over 75%. Service providers accounted for 14% of total billings and were up 25%. Moving now to the income statement, product revenue growth of 41% drove a 3-point shift in the product and services revenue mix and along with it a gross margin decrease of 160 basis points to 77.5%. Product gross margin improved to 70 basis points to 61.7%. Services gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 86.9%, with datacenter investments and FX accounted for about 100 basis points of the impact. Operating margin of 25.4% was at the top end of the guidance range. Despite a 350 basis point headwind from the gross margin decline, a weaker US dollar, and increased travel and marketing event cost. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 9043, an increase of 17%. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the second quarter came in at a quarterly record of $395 million benefiting from strong revenue growth, good month one linearity and lower capital expenditures. For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 455,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of $92 million, and an average share price of approximately $201. The remaining share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter was $921 million, with the authorization set to expire at the end of February 2022. We ended the first half of the year with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1 billion investment grade debt issuance during the first quarter of 2021. DSO's returned to pre-pandemic levels, decreasing seven days year-over-year, and 15 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days. Inventory turns increased to 2.7 times from 2.2 times, reflecting strong product sales in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million and we have started to move into the new Sunnyvale building. We estimate third quarter capital expenditures to between $65 and $75 million, which includes a $30 million payment for the new campus building. We estimate 2021 capital expenditures to be between $175, and $200 million. With the acceleration of the growth and a little more understanding of the post pandemic work patterns, we are turning our attention to reviewing our facilities footprint, and the needed office and warehouse capacity in the U.S. and Canada. As we work through this process it is possible that our estimated capital expenditures for the next few quarters will increase as we prepare for the next phase of our growth. Looking forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. Given the growth opportunities that we believe I had, we continue to expect to tilt our bias within this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters. The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales effectiveness, the growing success of the single integrated security platform strategy, and the convergence of security and networking, the response of the current threat environment, and our development efforts which include continuing to invest in our ASIC advantage which enables a shared operating system across the Security Fabric platform, drives our price for performance advantage, increased the capacity to add features and functions while maintaining price points. And now I'll give your outlook for third quarter summarized on Slide 9 which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter we expect billings in the range of $940 million to $960 million, revenue in the range of $800 million to $815 million, non-GAAP gross margin of $77.5 to 78.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%. This includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and the increased travel and marketing costs, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. With that, we are raising our 2021 guidance and expect billings in the range of $3.870 billion to $3.920 billon, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 26%. Revenue in the range of $3.210 billion to $3.250 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 24.5%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.045 billion to $2.075 billion, which represents growth of approximate 23% and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 28%. Non-GAAP gross margin is 77% to 79%. Non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 27%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing cost. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 to $3.90, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and 170 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $90 million. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, and the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution, and outstanding success in the first half of 2021. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter, for the Q&A session. Hey Pete, operator Kathryn we are ready to open the call for questions please. Operator : Sure. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs. Sir, please go ahead. Brian Essex : Great, thank you for taking the quarter and guys congratulations on the results, really nice set of results this quarter. Maybe to start off Ken, I know you've talked in three years about not having exposure to final [ph] refresh cycles within your business. Could you maybe unpack a little bit the product revenue performance? Are you starting to see perhaps some exposure to the refresh cycles of others? Is this more rip and replace infrastructure upgrades or expansions? Maybe if you can maybe give us a little bit of an understanding of what's going on behind the product revenue growth this quarter? Ken Xie : Yes, thanks Brian, good question. I have said the industry whether during the pandemic, after the pandemic probably in some kind of a whole structure changing is no longer the traditional border kind of firewall will be enough. You have to expand into the WAN like security WAN the 5G and also internal have to do maybe internal segmentation replacing the switch with secure switch and the Wi-Fi to program now it is kind of a [indiscernible] kind of internal attack. So that's where and also consolidation also going on and also maybe have a [indiscernible] make a different powerful structure security together to protect the whole attack more to kind of attacks everywhere protection there. So that's where we will see is a big change for the whole architecture of how to architect a new protection architecture to protect the whole infrastructure security there. So that's probably different than the actually fresher traditional firewall that is the new expanding infrastructure need to be have our own protection there. So that's what we see like the program we announced today, [indiscernible] inside the high speed mobile environment to do all these kind of internal segmentation, [indiscernible] protection and all these kind of things. And then also we see very strong growth whether the secure C-band and also the 5G [indiscernible] and that's to have lot of [indiscernible] work on phone solution there. That's what is doing probably even much faster there. So maybe this is the whole infrastructure being changed. [Indiscernible] now working started coming more [indiscernible] by the boost on the price and also different kind of vertical. Brian Essex : Got it, that's super helpful. Maybe to followup, service provider was slightly lower as a percentage of revenue this quarter. I understand that on the product revenue side and the high end you saw lot better growth, but it is, should we think about that segment particularly to the extent that they might be selling through for SASE or you might be getting better traction with OPAQ. Howe should we think about growth in the service provider market, is that still to come or is that a more stable kind of mid 20s grower segment for you? d Ken Xie : I think in the ramp up stage, in the early stage of ramp up, compared to last quarter probably like down about 15 percentage, this quarter grew about 25%. So it is [indiscernible] like dimension, they are kind of building infrastructure right here for the 5G, [indiscernible] and now SASE, which we have a different strategy or faster strategy actually quite a different, probably very different from our other player. And so we have a new strategy and we are [indiscernible] and are working with service provider to build in their SASE at the same time like the service revenue we will be kind of low to margin that will be there. Also we have seen some own infrastructure, if some customer don\u2019t have a service provider or want to working without them that we also have a kind of own kind of SASE solution there, which is also in the grade with the -- for the OS, inside for the OS, they have a building SASE they trust no access and some other part. They could also come in a different, there is no competitor and eventually they also hoped they can use ASIC plus data to additional continued power to our kind of own SASE solution there. So that's where we feel is a long term investment, but once we have it, we have a huge advantage compared to other competitors. Brian Essex : All right, that's helpful color. Thank you very much and congrats again. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Hamza Fodderwala : Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. I had a followup regarding the prior question on some of the drivers of product revenue growth. So Ken, as the customers are coming back into the office or as we move into this more hybrid work environment, and you talked a lot about these larger network transformation deals. I was wondering what do you see the pipeline looking like or those larger deals heading into the back half and beyond? And do you think that some of the things that we saw in the past 12 to 18 months is going to be an accelerant for those more larger and infrastructure type deals? Ken Xie : You know, we see the pipeline were strong for the larger multiple products deal, which like approach, I mean covered multiple part of infrastructure and also the product only grows like 41% is also very strong. We feel that all products we have different than the traditional are some of our competitors are using the [indiscernible] only. So we have the latest in the industry, but also we developed ASIC in the last 21 years. Just like the product we announced today, the -- based on our [indiscernible] we call it [indiscernible] region, but for the same cost was the function, performance compare to other competitor of industry average, so will have six time better performance basically like a -- because the competing part is huge from our own ASIC. And so that's what's changing the landscape of like the product what is now a security product or some other leverage basic is a huge [indiscernible] power gave us much better function and a better performance that can hugely replace a lot of our competitors. At the same time, we did see the expansion product as per market whether it will be from home or kind of a security internal work inside the company inside a data center which also plan lot of high end product loss, so the hybrid product [indiscernible] also we see public putting high maybe the highest in the last few quarters and even last few years. Hamza Fodderwala : All right, that's helpful. And maybe just a followup question for Keith or Ken. Now Keith you mentioned the operating margin in the back half having about a 200 basis point impact from FX. I was just wondering just on your spending plans around hiring what you're seeing there, it's obviously a very competitive market for talent these days and I'm wondering if that's been factored all into your guidance? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think we obviously pay attention to our recruiting and to our attrition rates. I think the metric that we gave was that our overall headcount increased 17%. I would offer that the sales headcount actually grew significantly more than that. So I think that we're in a bit of a sweet spot and it kind of relates to what Ken was saying just a moment ago in terms of the success that we're having and I think you could read through to the high end FortiGates was probably being data center deployments and probably taking advantage of some competitors that are going through a refresh cycle and at the same time some of the branch FortiGates maybe [indiscernible] visual transformation. And I think that the audience of sales people understand that and they see the opportunities there. Hamza Fodderwala : Thank you. Operator : And sir, our next question is from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. You may go ahead. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks guys. For my one question, I just wanted to dive into Keith, in your prepared remarks you made the comment that the majority of growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities embedded in the operating system. I wondered if you could kind of peel back the onion there? What does that mean and what capabilities were you referring to that were in particular demand in the quarter? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think that we tried to make the point in the past that some people think about the firewall somewhat complicically. We found a track close to 12 to 15 different firewall use cases. Well if you want to talk about micro segmentation, IPS, et cetera, all of those, the totality of those, the growth there was contributed more if you will than SD-WAN. SD-WAN we saw still obviously contributed very nicely at 14% of our total billings, which probably puts it close about 35%, or probably 55% growth. So I think there's a long list of things that a firewall is use for and we were very pleased with the success that we saw throughout that suite of offerings. Ken Xie : Also, especially the Forti [indiscernible], your beauty and your cosmetic access, and the beauty of SASE there we see strong interest in this area. Both found a service provider for enterprise by working on a solution there. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you, Operator : And sir, our next question is from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. You may go ahead. Rob Owens : Great, like thank you guys for taking my question and following the lead of Mr. Auty, I'd like to ask one question. Could you elaborate a little bit on your commentary around some of these non-traditional verticals that are starting to tick up meaningfully in spend, is this more one time in nature or these verticals were just starting to wake up to some of the security issues that we're reading about in the media every day? And to that and maybe you could comment a little bit around your OT success and your strategy there? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes, and then Rob, I think you did a very good job of laying all the dots to connect there. We're talking, we're looking at industries or verticals, such as manufacturing, transportation, energy utilities, or what have you. And to see the dramatic growth that we saw in that segment of business. We have, we've historically talked about our top-five, financial services, government service provider, tech, and retail, and they've been very consistent about that 65% to 66%, but we saw a significant shift this quarter. To those others, that was just the sheer growth that we saw on those others. And the point that you alluded toOT, OT performed very, very strongly in the quarter. And I think that's consistent with what we saw that vertical growth in those other verticals that I just mentioned. Rob Owens : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Shaul Eyal of Cowen and Company. You may go ahead. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Also, single question on my end. When we look at the billing upside, revenue upside you've printed, can you unpack for us the mix between your logos and the current installed base? Any qualitative color and discussion will be appreciated. Keith Jensen : Yes, this Shaul is Keith. New logos were very strong in the quarter, probably up about 50% year-over-year. And I've given numbers in the past to kind of suggest that 5000 customers that we had the quarter, obviously a very strong quarter is going to be north of that first part of the response. Second part response, you would not normally expect to see that the new customers in the initial quarter would be significant contributors to revenue, but rather contributors to revenue growth over the longer period of time. But there was a very strong performance from the new logo segment in terms of customers have signed up with us in the quarter. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Ken, maybe for you, you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk a little bit about the new pricing options that you announced recently? Specifically, do you feel like there is demand for that per user pricing for kind of access to the broader FortiCare and FortiGuard portfolio and what sort of what was sort of some of the early feedback as you may be tested those options? Ken Xie : We do see going forward, especially like works from now remotely. The producer license which can cover multiple devices, including the mobile home device, work for home, and also internal inside enterprise company there like a cover multiple, like a not just a 40-K that goes through to the trust network access, but also some other like a web or mail or some other application or kind of a compiler infrastructure data center, they need access. So that per user license will make much easier for the user for the customer to really use in all these security servers in a multiple part infrastructure module cover multiple product there. So that's where we feel this is also very important part. And on top of the current FortiCare, we certainly would cover all the parts that we have and also the FortiGuard cover the product need a real time update on the subscription, all these kind of things there. So we feel this FortiTrust is probably the trend in the future, but still needs some time to ramp up. Especially we see the deal trust member access setting have a pretty quick growth opportunity with which we are fully paid out to have all this built in. And also the identity how to like, kind of make sure the identity across multiparty infrastructure and easily kind of management user we feel all these two services also kind of don't get very important. It needs some time ramp up, but we do see there's a huge increase and demand in front of customer. That is also the reason we launched this new FortiTrust service. Saket Kalia : Got it. Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question, sir, from Michael Turits of KeyBanc. You may go ahead. Michael Turits : Hey, everybody, a huge quarter of course. I think for both Keith and for Ken, a lot of people have been circling around and trying to understand the strength and the upside. But I just would like to just try to compare where the demand was last year, in 2020, to where it is this year. And why it seems so much stronger. Has there been a shift, say from remote access focus to more breach or what has changed both qualitatively and quantitatively that we're seeing this acceleration? Ken Xie : Last year, the probably more like in the rush supporting whatever can make it work in working remotely. But this year, they did definitely see the infrastructure need to be upgraded to be changed to more supporting this long-term. So that's where we see a lot of new infrastructure design and how to supporting not just work remotely, but also secure the whole infrastructure, different part of the infrastructure from their own when access to their internal segmentation. And also even the 5G or I see my own internal Wi-Fi. So there's a lot of new security architecture covering multiple part of product is more of a strong interest. And also Keith mentioned the OT is a moderate because the whether the 5g IoT OT, also that's also rather strong. Keith Jensen : Yes, Mike, I think I agree with Ken completely. And maybe just to add, if you think back about Q2 2020, specifically, at least for us, it was a quarter that was characterized probably by a lot of software. We did very well with our software in the second quarter last year. But on the flip side, anything that requires somebody to be on premise in a data center or taking on a large deployment or phased deployment or something like that, Q2 of last year, there really wasn't much of that. Obviously today, I think it's a year later, it's a very, very different environment in that regard. And I do think you're also seeing the threat environment and things like the OT, part of the business do very, very well. Michael Turits : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. You may ask your question. Jonathan Ho : Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to understand if you're running into any issues around the supply chain or potential chipset shortages. And does this lead to any potential impact to your order cadences at all? Keith Jensen : I'd love to say that we're completely immune to chip shortages and such, but I can't say that. I do think that as we talked about last quarter, the fact that our inventory turns we run, hover around to, suggested that we have six months of inventory on hand. We do and then some of the chip manufacturers are pretty focused on a 52 week lead time. I think I feel very, very good about how the manufacturing operations team executed in the second quarter and how they're going about things for the third quarter for the rest of this year. I would offer that as part of the forecasting process and the guidance setting process. That has become a more significant input, if you will, into that process and making sure that we've accounted for it in terms of our estimates of any challenges that we may have was moved through the rest of the year. Jonathan Ho : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Sir, you may go ahead. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Ken, historically, when there are periods like this, where you see accelerated purchase behavior and a little bit of a one on supply, if you will, inevitably there's a bit of a digestion period after the fact, as customers learn how to deploy and consume what they just purchased. Could you talk a little bit about how fabric in the broader organization, either in sales or the channel is addressing or thinking about that potential risk into the future? Ken Xie : Yes, we definitely see more and more customers to the benefit of the fabric, call it fabric which on multiple products, I think we make with ultimate together. So that's also making the Non-FortiGate grow faster than the FortiGate will be over a billion dollar, over a simple do a billion dollar this year. And so it is a customer, buy this multiple product most of them already, like whether they are our customer or already test them on the pod, and then just keep expanding beyond the what's the initial purchase there. So we do see the interest get stronger and stronger and the Non-FortiGate also keeping flow much faster than the FortiGate, which keep expanding from whatever the current installation base within the big enterprise. That's also the Gartner forecast. They see the integration, the consolidation starting kind of more and more important for these big enterprise because to manage multiple products from different vendors, much higher cost compared to like, that the platform approach, which can multiple products have a different part of infrastructure also using it quite often to guide at least the FortiGate fabric that we have. Keith Jensen : This is Keith and just kind of to build on Ken's comment, I think that is the business strategy, right? If we look at our installed base of customers and see how their adoption progresses in terms of the number of fabric products that they add, over what period of time, we will certainly expect that to continue on. And then if you look in the current quarter, the new customers that we added, those are largely, those are buying firewalls, if you will, and maybe one or two things, if you will from the fabric suite. But we would expect them I guess I understand they have to digest and install the firewalls. But as we get as they get to know and understand our product and our integration strategy more and more, that we'll have the opportunity to come back in and sell them additional products and services as we go forward. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Operator : And our next question from Gray Powell of BTIG. You may now ask your question. Gray Powell : Okay, great, thanks. Yes, so I'd like to stick with the, the topic of Non-FortiGate and fabric and cloud and just sort of the strength that you've been seeing there. Within fabric and cloud, what are like the biggest product components that have the -- that have the most momentum? And then how should we think about just the sustainability of that demand longer term? Ken Xie : The Non-FortiGate, we have almost 30 products, most of them are developed internally and it's super [indiscernible] now gave up. I mean, individual product, because it is up and down quarterly, and also pretty much all contribute to the growth, we don't see any one or two too much kind of often compared with others. So that's probably maybe some time later, we can start I guess sorting things out. But at this stage, we do see, it's also dependent on a customer environment, depends on the sales support in, like some of them like have a e-mail working with FortiGate, some with website, some is employing, some is -- like access control, or some kind of sandboxing. And all cloud approach is a quite a white collar job or kind of even cover all these as like a 2020 product. So that's where it was difficult to break out and then try to see the trend, but we do see that the compliment is really to consolidate, integrate, automate approach, definitely has a huge benefit compared to our separate products from different vendors. Gray Powell : Got it. That's, that's really helpful. Thank you very much, and congratulations on the great results. Ken Xie : Yes, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. You may now ask your question. Adam Tindle : Okay, thank you. I wanted to ask a strategic question to Ken. You had record quarterly free cash flow. So Keith's doing a core job at managing that more efficient balance Keith you talked about at the Analyst Day. But all joking aside, Ken, you've got significant liquidity available both on the balance sheet and can imagine lenders beating down your door. So if you could double click on the key tech areas that you would consider to enhance the value proposition, I would just imagine that SASE is accelerating or the SD-WAN leader, for example, some of those secure web gateway players in the private markets are more mature and would that be an area of consideration or any other key areas that you would consider enhancing the value proposition inorganically? Thank you. Ken Xie : Yes, we definitely keeping closely watching out of the chain in the industry, and also new technology auditions. But also we want to keep the innovation, not the culture we have in the last 21 years and also keep the organic growth was strong. Probably the cash level investment strategy to Keith to cover that. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think for us, we look at our R&D spending as a source of investment, not a traditional capital allocation. But we are have historically been a buy versus permanent build versus buy company. And that is to, we feel strongly about the importance of having the platform to be integrated. You do see us doing tuck-in acquisitions, sometimes they take a little bit longer to bring to market perhaps because the technologies are things that we want to work with a little bit more before we bring them out. So I don't think that's a surprise. I don't know that precludes us from doing something larger in the future, but we'll look at those opportunities as they come up. The continuing focus will be take finding the opportunities to rebalance the balance sheet with a little bit of deploying some of the cash we raised the debt offering perhaps repurchase some, some share buyback, if you will. And at the same time also, as we look out for the next three to five years, and we anticipate continued growth, perhaps a little more investment, if you will, in our facilities footprint. Adam Tindle : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Sir, you may go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi, thanks for letting me on. And I would also like to add my congratulations on the great quarter. I had a question on SD-WAN. I was wondering if you can perhaps unpack some of the drivers behind the continued momentum here, whether the current hybrid work environment has been a contributor behind this strength? And can you help us understand what workers gradually returning to offices means for you? Ken Xie : Irvin, good question. There are a few more and we still see more of our strong demand and also huge potential. That our product we have Integrated Security from our beginning leverage to FortiGate has a huge computing power. Part of what - FortiGate, we see a huge advantage compared to some other competitor whether using the universal CPU or some other approach, which difficult at any function because the company implementation for a low cost CPU. So that's where we do believe we will be the leader, the number one leader in IT one space size, now definitely will be strong. And [indiscernible] it will offer a kind of huge advantage, like availability, the cost saving compared to the traditional networking protocol MPLS, or some other part. And also a lot of service provider also starting kind of most focus on their IP where no 5g some other part, we used to also kind of fit in all kind of long-term bigger picture, we call it security through networking, which will be compared with today all the networking just through a connection and the speed. And the security networking will also need to look at application, the content, the device behind, the user behind and even different kind of location there. So that's where we see all these kind of security function add on top of networking has huge potential and which is to buy the security while also doesn't just one part of it, but also the secure 5G and also internal secure switch infected Wi-Fi we do see a lot of our potential to keep in using security cover the whole infrastructure. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question from Imtiaz Koujalgi of Guggenheim Partners. Sir you may go ahead. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Hey, guys, thanks for your question. I have a question around the attach of supported subscriptions were part of this quarter because it looks like you had strong momentum and product. Your strong earnings momentum. Also it looks like the upside in product didn't lead to maybe it's sort of similar upside in billings. Was there a difference in products mix was led to difference in attach rate within subscription and support the score. Keith Jensen : Now, I think the -- we track our attach rates and our renewal rates, if you will, within those advantages anything I let say plus or minus 2%. And I think that, you know, we were comfortably inside those brands. So there was nothing unusual in that regard. I think that the services buildings in total, we're probably have to go back and check that the best quarter that we've had in four years. So I feel so good about the both the services and the product performance in the quarter. Imtiaz Koujalgi : And just one follow up, you give us a mix of balance between FortiGate to Non-FortiGate is that had the same kind of mix you have in the product line also. This the 70,30 roughly, is that the mix of Non-FortiGate and FortiGate in the product line, or is that mix different for products? Keith Jensen : Yes, I don't have that number in front of me, but I don't have a reason. I don't recall them being significantly different. We've looked at them. And I'm trying to recall what we leave in the script just a moment ago in terms of product revenue. Yes, I think we've offered FortiGate product revenue growth in the script, as well as Non-FortiGate product revenue said they were both, FortiGate was 40% and Non-FortiGate was over 40%. Ken Xie : Those are growth rates we don't we haven't given a breakdown by mix for the two per product. We haven't even FortiGate a product and non- FortiGate product there's a mix we haven't given that. Imtiaz Koujalgi : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Patrick Colville : Thank you so much for taking my question. I mean, 41% product growth is extremely impressive. I guess, questions were fielding from investors around the cyclicality or the kind of, I guess, whether it's secular growth and so, could you just help us understand, whether one time benefits because of recent hacks or because in recent events or post-Coronavirus that led to this kind of very strong number or a feeling that, the follow market there comes from some secular dynamics that we all should be aware of? Ken Xie : We do see the lot of product started going through the, lot of a new part of infrastructure or kind of a new area. And that has also like Keith mentioned, decided top five vertical, we do see the, other vertical growth faster, much faster than the top five verticals that common service provider, finance service, education type something like that. That is, but also make a money infrastructure we do see like, whether deploy on the WAN side on the whatever the [indiscernible] or some other kind of internet infrastructure within data center, or even with a home, there's a quite a broad, kind of like a buying pattern compared to before. And that also, we do believe we eventually will drive additional service because the western product round may go up and your service revenue will come in later. And also classic production of the new FortiTrust service. They feel it's all also add an additional layer of potential security survey for the future. It's definitely not definitely simpler, like I mentioned early that receives the changing of the security infrastructure. It is not kind of refresh or replace the traditional firewall, which also from time-to-time need to be upgraded, because now we'll have faster and faster, but also expanding into the new infrastructure part and also kind of a new area. We do see all kind of growth faster than the traditional microfinance surveys or some other part. Keith Jensen : Yes, to add to Ken;s comments, I think it was a quarter. And it has been for a while now that we just saw a lot of tailwinds. The tailwinds included whether it was SD-WAN or OT as an example. Now, the refresh opportunity, if you will, is really an opportunity for us to review as updated displays the incumbents. Credit for net that has 500,000 customers and 70 different firewall models and we even today we announced the new firewall in our press release. You know, it's not as if, historically you've seen blips with us in terms of spikes from refresh. But on the flip side, some of the competitors and legacy players have a shorter list of customers and a shorter list of products. And maybe you're not doing as well in Gartner Magic Quadrant as we are. So we view that as an opportunity. I do think that, other tailwinds that came into the quarter. We talked about the verticals can mention it again, and also when I look at our customer sizes, whether you're SMB, to always to the global 2000 did very, very well, I think one thing that stood out for us was the mid enterprise or the commercial part of the business that came on very, very strong in the quarter as well. So I think there was a long list of tailwinds for us that that worked out in our favor on that product revenue growth number. Ken Xie : Yes, also the review, the introduction of the new products that compete in part advantage comes from [indiscernible]. It's bigger and bigger compared to other competitor, which not only helping make, replacing some of the installation page, but also expanding the memory area of the internal network, high speed environment, but also has a much more function beyond a traditional network security. Therefore, VPN, like we mentioned, whether from as your partner acts as a module, like a SASE or other product like SD-WAN and the 5G security, which none of the traditional firewall has. And that's also what had additional like sales and on the product, also the future service, which is not refresh compared to the traditional firewall, which they don't have that function or don't have a company in power to keep additional function of their current performance demanding. So that's where we feel the strategy we have. That is ASIC company and part advantage and that give us additional function and additional performance, much lower costs, and starting working very well. Patrick Colville : Great, thank you so much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. You may go ahead. Tal Liani : Hey, great. Thank you. I want to talk about gross margin. If I'm correct, and it's if I'm not, it's not going to be the first time, but if I'm correct, your gross margin had gotten down about 140 bits sequentially. And I also checked it versus consensus. It's lower, 100 bits lower than consensus this quarter, next quarter and 200 bits below consensus for the year for the guidance. So do I have any having stake in my calculation or it's not? Can you elaborate on gross margin? Why is it lower sequentially and the guidance? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think what you're seeing it's all is the mix shift, right? The product mix shift versus the services mix shift, you can do some pretty simple math in the second quarter. And you can get to, when you have 41% product revenue growth at 61%, 62% gross margin, versus the services that's fairly confident 23% and 88%, gross margin, that 25%, swing and gross margin. When you take that back and you look at it 20 points or 25 point over performance and product, it works out to be just about one point maybe a just little bit north of one point on the gross margin line. Ken Xie : Also you can look in the product gross margin, we actually improved year-over-year, even the cost kind of increased, but we do improve the product gross margin. And also we do believe is the product gross margin, product growth 41%, we can have a lot of a future growth in the service. That's also the reason we had the FortiCare and the FortiGate and same had FortiTrust, which we do believe we're keeping, making the future, so ending that the service studies grow faster going forward. Tal Liani : Is there any change in the pricing environment? Keith Jensen : There's no change in the discounting. Discounting for the quarter was neutral for us, if you will, we have taken certain steps as we look forward to, some of the changes in the cost structure that we're seeing from our suppliers. And we've taken certain steps in terms of our own pricing going have not actually hit yet. But they will hit in time for when we actually see those costs in our income statement. Tal Liani : Can you elaborate on the last point? What does it mean? So do you expect the margins to decline? Or do you expect to increase prices in anticipation? Keith Jensen : I don't expect, I do not expect margins to decline now. Beyond what will happen with a mix, you have to if you will, between products and services, right to the extent we continue to overreact to over performance, the product line the way we just did, it's going to put pressure on the gross margin line. But keep in mind, the operating margin came in right at the high end of the range. So I think we successfully managed that. And it's certainly very consistent with what we foreshadowed earlier in the year, where we said within our framework, this was a year in which we would go towards growth. We obviously did that putting up 35% billings growth and 41% product growth, and at the same time delivering 25% operating margin plus. Ken Xie : Yes, we also did more investment on infrastructure, which kind of making the service revenue gross margin lower a little bit, but also help in the future and additional servers come in. Tal Liani : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Ittai Kidron : Thanks and great results as well guys. Ken, I was hoping to kind of, you gave a lot of great color on the backdrop and what you're doing and how you're extending well in the field, but maybe you can tie it up also with the competition discussion, maybe you can kind of help us understand what you're seeing from your competitors right now and who do you see is his most vulnerable for share loss, because it's clear that you're going to continue to gain share in this marketplace for the foreseeable future. But who do you see are as the more vulnerable vendors here that are likely to see to you and others that bring to the table what you can bring to the table? Ken Xie : Better the growth - and we just have some long term strategic investment, which gives us more advantage, whether from the ASIC chip, which we started with 21 years ago, or starting building other part of fabric products, which integrate ultimately from day one, comparison, or competitor, more company acquisition makes it more difficult to do the integration and automation and maintain the organic growth there. But on the other side, we do see this sort of market shift changing. We also want to take the time, like our SASE strategy, we have a private omni lender working with a service provider to feed their SASE need long term good product for them the same time building some infrastructure as a model to integrate within the FortiGate, Forti OS as a single as our products and cover also SASE that has no access or some other parts, such as the one security, making the product kind of more easier for customer to deploy and fit in the big environment, fast environment much, much better. So that actually we continue to have this kind of a lot of long term strategy, and we do see the -- like a long-term benefits going forward. Ittai Kidron : Very good. I tried. Thanks, guys. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Speakers, that would be our last question for this call and I'll turn it back over to Peter Salkowski. You may go ahead. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Kathryn. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. Fortinet will be attending the following investor, Virtual Investor Conferences during the third quarter. We're doing the Oppenheimer Conference on August 10 and KeyBanc on August 11. Events with presentations will be webcast and those web cast links are going to be up on our website. Actually, they're already up on our website as of now. If you have any questions, following this call, please feel free to reach out to me. And with that, have a great day and take care everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : And thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding third quarter 2020 web result. Billings increased 42% to $164 million, exceeding our $1 billion in quarter $2 billion for the first time in Fortinet History. Global to $2000 billion growth accelerates to over 50% total revenue growth 33% to $857 million with product revenue up 51%, our highest quarterly product revenue growth since going public in November 2009, with very strong business momentum, which remains focused on growth. According to Gartner, the negro parameter is fragmented with many security team and the tools are producing cellos. And integration best operated solution, only add to the complexity. To address this challenge, Gartner is predicting that by 2024 optimizations that adopt our separate security mesh architecture will reduce the financial impact, of the individual security incident by an average of 90%.  In a recent report, Gartner called out, Fortinet Security Fabric as a platform that offers cybersecurity mash architecture approach. Fortinet is helping customers softening the issue of capacity through our security driven networking as security fabric platform, our approach for  for the basic offers factor 10 ton most security computing power. These results in tightly integrated functionality with better performance, lower cost, and power consumption compared to agenda CPU.  Or again, late the run-up it 40 Fabry solution like email lab and end-point together with FortiGate, firewall, offers much broader protection. While you integration at a better automation than other competitive solutions. As solutions continue to consolidate towards a powerful approach. And as  secured expand to local ad a wide area network to the walk for any aware environment and to the cloud. Fortinet is strongly positioned to significantly capture market share of our projected total addressable market of more than a $174 billion by 2025. We are confident that this trend together with our -- relented this focused on organic innovation will drive better-than-industry average long-term growth for Fortinet. Walk from anywhere is here to stay.  The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly expanded the walk for anywhere . According to Gardner, authorizations are facing a hybrid future with 75% of workers seeing their expectation for working flexibility has increased. Today, Fortinet announcement industry most completes solution to enable organization to secure and connect warfare anywhere.  Our unions fly Fortinet, broad portfolio of Aviva Trust, endpoint, and network security solution within the Fortinet security fabric. Fortinet delivers security that follows user wager on the load and home are in the office to provide enterprise grade protection and the productivity. The 2021 Gartner magic quadrant for 1AG infrastructure address announced.  Fortinet was once again named the leader, placed -- highest ability to execute at a rent number 1 for Gray mode, Wolchok in critical capability. The leadership SD-WAN, Fortinet and of our rising recently are not the expansion of their wireless and global outfront with Fortinet secure SD-WAN. The solution is designed to provide enterprise on the business market customer. Was a converged networking security solution box to secure and connect war for nowhere.  We continue to see momentum and adoption of our secure SD-WAN when 5G board SDB branch and the cloud delivered SASE solution among the worlds largest of its providers. These service providers, including AT&T, which is Ted accounting kind of foreign IKA and others. We plan to announce in the coming months before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, and farmers worldwide for their continued support on our work. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Let's start the more detailed Q3 discussion with revenue and the drivers for our record-setting product revenue growth. Clearly, demand is strong. Total revenue of $867 million was up 33% driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 51%. Looking closer at the 51% product revenue growth, our highest quarterly product growth rate in 12 years as a public Company, we can point to 3 drivers.  First, the convergence of security and networking, or what we call security driven networking. Second, strong customer demand for vendor consolidation on platforms. And third, a heightened awareness of today's elevated threat landscape across a broader set of entities. Fortinet is proud to be an innovative leader in security driven networking. With a convergence of security and networking functionality incorporated into our broad integrated and automated security fabric platform. Our security driven networking investments in Wi-Fi switching, LAN, datacenter, Cloud 5G, and enabled us to provide integrated security at networking speeds from the datacenter to end-points and to the cloud. And with our secure SD-WAN solution, security at the edges.  Today we announced a unified solution enabling organizations to secure and connect work from anywhere. The unifying our zero-trust endpoint and network security solutions. We can deliver enterprise-grade security services and threat intelligence that seamlessly follows users on the road at home and in the office.  That's for consolidation. Customers are increasingly focused on vendor consolidation, automation, and platform strategies to provide a broad, integrated, and single platform approach the security, that effectively protect from the wide range of an attack vec -- attack vectors. Our security fabric platform, provides a broad range of security products, integrated on a single operating system.  Gartner recently called out Fortinet security fabric as a platform that provides a cybersecurity mesh architecture approach, or CSMA. The cornerstone of foreign as CSMA may approach is our AC driven Florida gates, which provide on average 5 to 10 times more computing power than competitors, firewalls running on common CPU's.  They're greater computing power allows our software engineers to embed additional security functionality and integration into the operating system, enhancing our price for performance advantage. The integration extends across our suite of security fabric solutions. It consists of the complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, Cloud, SaaS, and perpetual software.  Those hosted in non-hosted solution. And lastly, turning to awareness, the explosion of ransomware attacks has led to a greater awareness of the need for cybersecurity technologies. According to latest global threat landscape report published by our FortiGate -- FortiGate labs. The number of unique ramps OEM -ready taxes per week increased more than ten times from July of 2020 to June of 2021.  The increase in the taxes across entities of all sizes, geographies, and industries. These 3 factors, the convergence of security and networking, the adoption of cybersecurity mash architecture, and a greater awareness with threat landscape drove record-setting product revenue growth contribute to market share gains for Fortinet. The dramatic product revenue growth was broad-based, with FortiGate and Non-FortiGate, both posting product revenue growth rates of approximately 50%. While tilting our current revenue mix 450 basis points from higher margin services revenue to product revenue. FortiGate product revenues were driven by entry-level in high-end FortiGate product revenue growth of 60% and 57% respectively.  Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was driven by several platform products including mail, sandbox, SIM, switches, and virtual firewalls. Rounding out our revenues, we saw service revenue of $530 million up 24%. Support and related services revenue was up 26% to $243 million while security subscription services revenue was up 22% to $287 million. Turning to revenue by Geo, that summarize on Slide 5, revenue in EMEA increased 33%.  In the Americas revenue increased 29%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 43%. Moving to billings., 40 billings crossed the $1 billion threshold, for the first time in our history. At $1 billion, $64 million billings were up 42%, as enterprises responded to the expanding threat landscape. Favoring costs were performance leaders, in integrated platform or CSMA strategies.  This is especially evident across the enterprise segments, for example, in the large enterprise sector, global 2,000 billings were up 52%, with growth accelerating over the last 3 consecutive quarters. And for the second consecutive quarter, we added over 6000 new logos across all customer segments. FortiGate billings were up 39% and accounted for 70% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, entry level on high-end FortiGate posted very strong billings growth. Non FortiGate billings were up 49%.  Driving a 1-point billings mix shift to Non-FortiGate. The top ten solutions accounted for 68% of Non-FortiGate billings and we're up 48%. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 70% to 83 deals and saw secure SD-WAN deals more than doubled to 19. Average contract term increased three months year-over-year, and one-month, quarter-over-quarter to 29 months.  The increase in contract term was driven by the significant increase in G2000 and other large enterprise deals. SD-WAN billings were up 52%, outpacing the Company's billings growth and accounted for approximately 14% of total billings to continue to receive industry accolades. For the second consecutive year, Fortinet was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge infrastructure and positioned number one for ability to execute.  For critical capabilities Fortinet SD-WAN ranked first in the small ranch WAN, security sensitive and remote work use cases. And consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT billings were up 77% Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Among the top five verticals, worldwide government grab the largest share with a mix of 17% and saw billings growth of 22%.  We've made investments to expand our presence and engagement with the government sector. For example, in the U.S., where we recently added retired Forestar Adam Elster  to our Board of Directors. And yesterday for net federal announced Department of Defense certification approval for an additional 26 security fabric solutions. Internationally, we're set to over open for EPS federal government integration Innovation Center in Australia before the end of the year. Utilities, manufacturing, transportation, and construction, and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top 5, combined for billings growth of 68%.  We believe the growth of these verticals is another indicator of the broadening nature of the threat landscape, and is driving security investments in industries that may have shown less affluent security budgets, and lower internal labor resource levels. On August 31st, Fortinet acquired a controlling stake in Alexa networks. Are Japan base networking Company for approximately $64 million. Alexa provides high-performance network switches and routers in their local market. The investment increases our total addressable market, and reflects our leadership on the convergence of networking and security. Moving back to the Income statement, product gross margin declined 220 basis points to 60.7% reflecting the consolidation of  results and a change in our product mix.  Product cost increases associated with supply chain constraints were largely offset by our pricing actions. Services gross margins decreased 150 basis points to 86.6% due to Alexa and costs associated with expansion of our datacenter footprint. The 25.8% operating margin was 30 basis points above the top end of our guidance.  Despite pressure from lower gross margins and higher marketing expenses, primarily from the foreign net championship, , or event. Headcount increased 20% to 9,700, moving to the same, the cash flow summarize on Slide 78, free cash flow was $330 million representing a margin of 38%. Free cash flow benefited from strong billings, growth in good billings, linearity. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow margin was 41.5%. We repurchased approximately 370,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of 109 million at an average price per share of $2.94. The board increased the share repurchase authorization by 1.25 billion and extended the expiration date of February 2023. The remaining repurchase authorization is approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.4 billion.  Inventory turns increased to 2.9 times from 2.7 times in the second -- from the second quarter 2021. Reflecting strong product sales in the quarter, answers and some supply chain pressure. DSO's at 63 days returned to pre -pandemic levels. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $69 million, including a payment for the new campus building of $13 million. As we noted in our last earnings call, we've pivoted our capital expenditures strategy to include building out our facilities and operations infrastructure to support our accelerating growth.  We estimate fourth quarter capital expenditures to between $170 and $190 million investments in our future facilities and operations infrastructure account for the sequential increase in CapEx. Before providing guidance, I'd like to comment on the supply chain, the consumer widely publicized, that the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment is causing disruption in global supply chains for companies of all sizes, and industries.  We expect the worldwide supply chain constraints will present evolving challenges in the fourth quarter, and into 2022. The supply chain issues have proven to be extremely dynamic. And like to pause here to acknowledge and thank each member of our operations team, for their truly outstanding performance.  With regards to pricing, we believe we entered this space with a harder and reputation of being able to provide customers excellent price for performance or value. We believe we can leverage this reputation to largely offset our increased cost. We believe our pricing actions have been met with understanding by our customers, as evidenced by our Q3 results, and strong pipeline growth. We view the current situation as our supply challenge, not to demand challenge.  Now I'd like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on Slide nine, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. The following guidance reflects our best efforts estimate the supply chain impact. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of 1 billion to 165 million to one billion, 215 million.  Revenue in the range of 940 million to 970 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75 to 76%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 27 to 28%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from acquisitions, foreign exchange, and increased travel and marketing costs. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share were $1.10 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between 168 and 170 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%.  Based on our very strong third quarter performance, and the upside I just provided for the fourth-quarter expectations, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance. We expect billings in the range of $4.40 billion to $4.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximate 31.5%. Revenue in the range of $3.320 billion to $3.350 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28.5%.  Total service revenue in the range of $2.80 billion to $2.90 billion, which represents growth of 24% and applies full-year product revenue growth at 36%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.85. This assumes a share count of between 167 and 169 million. We expect our Non-GAAP tax rate to be 21% We expect cash taxes to be approximately 130 million, which includes a $47 million tax payment made in the fourth quarter. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, our customers, and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I will now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Peter Zarkowski : As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question to allow others to participate. Eli (ph), please open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. . For your first question, we have Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Essex : Great. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question and congrats on some really nice results this quarter. I guess, Keith, you spent some extra time talking about the supply chain and it's certainly the most frequent question I've gotten from investors, particularly over the past three weeks.  So could you maybe help us understand, what kind of headwind you're quantifying or accounting for in your 4Q guide? Where you might see risks in the supply chain? And then, what you might be seeing from peers, particularly where you may be benefiting from having supply where your peers may not have product? Keith Jensen : Thanks Brian and I don't know that anybody knows all the answers to the questions that you articulated at all. You thought I'll give you some color as well. I think we saw a little bit of supply chain pressure in the second -- in the third quarters I alluded to, but obviously the number's nothing that was terribly noteworthy.  I do think the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter is appropriately conservative, if you will, in terms of what we see for supply chain or what we would call backlog in the fourth quarter. I think we feel good about the guidance that we've given. I think the -- if you look at the general tone and what we're hearing from our operations team. I think there is sometime in the third quarter where every day was very dynamic with them.  With people calling and them having to scramble about component matters and contract manufacturing commitments or what have you. I'm hearing less about that at this point, that's probably very early on. I would also offer that, the backlog or supply chain first appears for us in some of the fabric products, the Non-FortiGate. And I think that'll continue on a little bit into the fourth quarter.  And probably also gets -- before it gets to some extent in the fourth quarter as well. Getting out to 2022, I think everybody is kind of in the same boat and trying to understand when we're actually going to see something to tell you real market improvement -- mark improvement. And I think we'll probably hold back commenting on that for the next several months until we get closer providing guidance for that, for the next year. Ken Xie : Brian is a 10  I feel we are little bit better position compare to competitor. First, it's why we have the quantity much louder than our competitor. We are probably like a 3x compared to the fiscal on a unit shipment, maybe  pulled out of some other, which gave us better negotiation power be similar to supply, and also will manage all these more directly compared our competitor  some sort of party.  that's given us better visibility and also can act quicker earlier. Second, we have quite a broad product line. Bolstering the FortiGate and also NAMA FortiGate is an easier for our customer to go to the next line of products has a similar performance and then all running the FortiOS in FortiOS. So it's a more easy to use in some different product to sell better some of their product shortage.  And also, we have a great team -- operation side. And the same time, we have a culture more than less than a long term both on their inventories and market sales compared to our competitor. To me, some even   5, 10, 15 years ago, we tend to keep some more trade to me customer urgent needs. So that's actually been for that supply chain issue. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you very much. On our Peter's request for just one question and step back in the queue. Operator : Next we have Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Tal Liani : Hey guys, you're killing me with this one question thing. I want to focus on the most important part, which is the growth acceleration. Your revenue -- your product revenue growth, went from 25% to 41% to 51% in the last 3 quarters. And your billing growth, went from 14% to 35% to 42%, it's just a major acceleration. And the question is, can you identify the key areas? I know that a lot of areas are growing, but when you look at material areas, meaning that the most -- the highest contribution to the growth acceleration. What are the key areas? Can you share with us the key areas, where you see the highest growth in terms of dollars? And can you also give us an update on SD-WAN specifically? Thanks. Ken Xie : As you can see, both of FortiGate and also Non-FortiGate, all revenue growth like, 50%. FortiGate is small really to -- because like, a whether the internal SEC communications to protect all these read somewhere or go to the when I stick us, you went.  And also the Non-FortiGate more tied to the story, the fabric Fortinet security fabric, which is also Gartner sat in promoting the core cybersecurity mash architecture, which can reduce the financial costs of our single event by legacy, 90%. I think that this falls contributor for the gross, like a key said. And also some vendor consolidation, we see some smaller vendors starting got weaker and weaker. So we do see some market share gain here also. Tal Liani : Okay? And when you look at 2022 and I know you don't provide guidance, but when you look forward, do you see the same drivers continuing to support the growth acceleration or how do you deal with these high targets next year? Ken Xie : We do see this trend it's not slowed down. Well last for probably a few years. What are we close security driven network in our secure fabric, which really we're helping the enterprise or service provider to look at better security and the customer obviously. So far be back see anything slowed down. We feel we're well positioned to keeping gaining market share. Keith Jensen : I would just echo what Ken said Tal for -- but I think the threat landscape as a hot topic of conversation in all quarters of other world have seen right now. And it doesn't seem like that's going to abate anytime soon. I think the needs -- what can and team have built here with the body security and network -- networking speeds is critical.  But I think also this platform of our gardeners now call it, calling the mesh architecture -- cybersecurity mesh architecture, I think consistent with partners all the reports about, the percentage of companies we are looking for consolidation, I think Ken's commented on that, and how that's going to continue to increase it. It's certainly seemed to those tailwinds, are poised to continue to exist as we get into 2022 Tal Liani : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next we have Shaul Eyal from Cowen. Your line is now open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Congrats on the performance and guidance, guys. Keith, that Federal vertical had a good performance. Was it just typical of third quarter of government seasonality? Or do you see that sustainable -- as sustainable buoying forward, given your recent investments, so within this vertical? Keith Jensen : Keep in mind for us, the government is a worldwide name when we talk about it. So it includes some U.S. Federal, international governments, also state and local governments, etc. It has been a very strong vertical of ours for well over a year, if not 2 years now. And I certainly don't see any reason that just on that basis that it was slowed down.  And I think if you overlay that with investments that, Ken and team are now making, particularly as it relates to the U.S. Federal team. I think there's some opportunities for us is to explore and exploit hopefully as we move forward. Shaul Eyal : Thanks. Operator : Our next we have Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Michael Turits : Hey, guys, some drill down on the FortiGate side and really understand. The purchasing has taken place and for what is good to see, I would think that we are modernizing datacenters, or is datacenter expansion? Is it displacements? And again, surprising perhaps considering the move to Cloud. So just drill down on the physical Bahram slashed quarter gate side. Keith Jensen : I think what we're -- and I hate to give compliments to my peers. But I think what we're really seeing here is really starting execution from the sales team. I think we came into this conversation and feeling that we had a very strong product suite. But I think the sales team has done a stellar job. And we talked to them about the same question you just asked me. Whereas if coming from?  I can hear and then the confidence and when it comes to Display's website. There's certainly no competitor that, they're afraid off. I can -- I can hear them articulate back the platform strategy, the land and the expand strategy. I can see them using some of the tools and products and technologies that, we've invested in -- invested in them.  And they're leveraging them, I think very successfully. So I -- going with a question going back, I think that, Tal have asked about, and we used this term before, a rising tide lifting all boats. And I think, we saw that in the quarter. There wasn't a weak geography, there wasn't a weak -- a weak product sweep, and I think everybody performed very strongly. Ken Xie : Yes. Keith is the global to solving, growing over 58% and also the last , is  made like an active year before. In some peak end up price in some service provider set in paying off. Michael Turits : Yes, I think it's the same question, so hopefully not too, but I'm just trying to figure out, of course, execution and competition doing well that way. But where are we in terms of people just buying stuff to put in datacenter is when we're really in a cloud mode here. Is it because of a refresh, or why we've seen that investment? Ken Xie : I think it's all claims to all like the long-term ASIC strategy which add a lot of performance and the more function, and the same time cost lower, and then low  also. That's where the security setting expands inside a data center inside Company, internal network, and also the wan side.  I see 1 5G. We also see a lot of driving for that end goal. So it's really selling expense for the whole infrastructures instead are traditionally just security Internet border. So that's how the much people total addressable market sometime because secure driven networking. But it's really a most suspended market and has smart strong security. Michael Turits : Thanks guys. Operator : Next we have Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. The ongoing asked my 1 question is an extension of what Michael was just talking about. I'm curious as you look at the growth in the quarter, even if it's qualitative, can you help characterize for us how much of that growth is coming from actual displacement of solutions, both traditional cybersecurity and networking, versus how much of that growth is coming from existing customers, buying additional expansion. An additional product is just a build-out the handle their growth needs. Keith Jensen : I think the metric I would give is 6,000 new logos. I think that, I'm going to go back and say, I mean, the  the execution was very strong across-the-board. Did we -- was there penetration, greater penetration in our installed base of customers? Absolutely. No doubt about it. But at the same time, that's two quarters back-to-back now that we've added 6,000 new logos, and I know some of those are small enterprises. But we're getting the at-bats that we've always coveted. And I think coming with more at-bats, I think you were seeing stronger execution as well. Ken Xie : Also, the existing customers keep expanding . Something like security plus structure approach, like adding to one side, I see 1 5G and also expand with the internal segmentation and Wi - Fi security data center security. So that's what I can boast about. I do see probably maybe more come from the cost keeping expanding their security infrastructure. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next we have Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Rob Owens : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll pivot a little bit from Sterling and ask about G2K specifically, and what is driving the strength in G2K billings. Is that products related, is it just better distribution relationships that are getting you into these accounts and who do you think share is coming from in this market? Thanks. Keith Jensen : I think the -- I would give a general comment in terms of where -- who is the market share gainers and who are the market share donors? I don't think there'll be any surprises. I've actually -- the mentioned names in terms of, who I thought those were. In terms of distribution, I think when you get in, particularly in the U.S. market with a large enterprise focused distributors, you've got a -- as a Company, you've got to invest in time and bring opportunities to them and demonstrate that, you have a superior product, a superior offering.  And I think that, the team has done the heavy lifting on that. And I do believe that, we are getting more momentum, if you will, from those large U.S. distributors that, maybe we did not have previously. So I think there's some of that. And then I think we've continued to invest in both the sales and the marketing. We knew all along for several years now that, we needed to improve our coverage in terms of  accounts that we're assigned to wraps. And the people that we're bringing in from outside and that, maybe had more of an enterprise experience unless of a channel experience, etc. So I do think that all those things have combined and are demonstrating the success, as you pointed out, G2000 growth at over 52% and accelerated for the last three quarters. Rob Owens : Thank you. Operator : All right. Now we have Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hamza Fodderwala : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I'm going to keep it to one question. But just on the OT side, you talked about that growing 77% this quarter. I think those are the first-time you mentioned that product specifically. Just curious, can you give us any rough sense of how material that's becoming to your overall billings and what's been driving that in more recent quarters? Keith Jensen : I think it's not as big as SD-WAN but growing faster. But also, I don't think we're -- I think that it's reached a point, if you will in terms of size that we're comfortable and we think its worthwhile making sure that we share with people outside the Company with those growth levels. If you combine SD-WAN and an OT together as a percentage of billings, you're going to get to something. I think that's over 20% of our total billings. Hamza Fodderwala : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Adam Morgens from Stifel. Your line is now open. Adam Morgens : Hey guys and thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just for Ken, so back at September, you guys signed a partnership with Linksys around securing work from home environments and segmenting corporate and personal networks. And I know one of your competitors also announced a similar idea. So how should we think about the idea of securing home networks and effectively the whole becoming extension of a branch office of one and the opportunity to do that as we live in this work from anywhere world going forward? Thanks so much. Ken Xie : It's a new market. It has a lot of potential supporting work from anywhere. That's where we partnered with LNG sales and which has down in home networking area for quite a while. And we do believe it's a -- eventually a lot of reasons if it's all these IOT are modest in connect online. And also a lot of our workforce and school from  is kind of since there at all when neither Security, which we combined with the network security while endpoint security and also the clouds amount SASE. So we do feel it's a big long-term potential. But as it's a not quite. I mean that -- the business actually ramp up quickly, but it's an eventually will contribute more revenue for the Company. Adam Morgens : Great, thanks so much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : And next we have Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now open. Jonathan Ho : Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on the strong results. Just wanted to, I guess, understand a little bit better the dynamics around the price increases to your base. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude or impact of the quarter from those increases? And is there a potential for that to stick even beyond some of these supply chain challenges? Thank you. Ken Xie : Yes. We work carefully increase the price based on how cost increase, which also supporting by some our partner and at the same time. Because we have much better performance price ratio, and also more function, especially on the 40-k side. So we do feel we have more room to address by some of the price, and still, customers do like the product. So soon probably we do some price increase. And we'll just offset the cost increase. And we'll get margin back online. Keith Jensen : I would add to that, Jonathan, the -- one of the metrics that we look at in the third quarter, which is our ability to hold the line of the price increases, which were largely effective on August 1st. I'd say largely because you have to give notice to your channel partners, which is appropriate. And you can imagine them taking certain actions to get orders in the 1st month of the quarter, if you will.  So it gets a little bit distorted that way. But we do look at our ASPs and wanting to make sure and are discounting that, we're not giving back that price increase, if you will. And overall, I think the headline is that, we think we were on the direct product line. I think it was secretive to the margin in the quarter.  And I emphasize the direct, because as volatile as it is, predicting things like expedite fees and sometimes, freight prayed as well, can come into that line. So I think overall, when you factor in direct and indirect, we're probably in a wash for the quarter. Jonathan Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we have a Gray Powell from BTIG your line is now open. Gray Powell : Great, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good numbers. So yeah, within your Non-FortiGate billings, can you roughly give us a sense as to how much is related to appliances versus software and Cloud? And then how should we think about supply chain issues potentially impacting Non-FortiGate in Q4? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think the Non-FortiGate mix is something on the order of about -- we talked about this before, something we were at 30% to 40% of that is Cloud or software. And the remainder will be a hardware form factor. As I mentioned in the call, I think the first place that we saw supply chain pressure in this third quarter, was in non-FortiGate, more specifically around switches and access points. Gray Powell : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Next we have Andrew Niwinski from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Niwinski : Great. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter. I want to ask about the high-end, that was certainly better than expected. I think over 37% of your FortiGate sales, which looks like it was the highest level of spend in at least the last two years. Can you talk about the drivers of the high-end? And whether the 5G rollouts in your leadership position in the carrier market might be contributing to that? Ken Xie : Yeah. The big enterprise, the Global 2000 that contributes some high-end growth. And also on the product we have fresh  And I think in the last 1 to 2 years, we also refresh a higher-end. You've seen the latest ASIC for MPS -7, which has have 5 x better performances and more function compared with the previous MP6, which I see the high-end we probably were scratched like, maybe 80% of the  is already. So that's also we said in benefit some of these refresh we made in the last 1 to 2 years. Andrew Niwinski : No contribution from the 5G carrier-class customers there? There's more on the enterprise? Ken Xie : There's some contribution from SD-WAN. But it's the 5G steering the ramp up stage. I don't see much, but I do see the huge potential. Andrew Niwinski : Super. Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : And next we have Irvin Liu from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Irvin Liu : Hi, thanks for the question. This question is for either Ken or Keith. You have the opportunity to meet with several customers and partners along with new prospects that, you\u2019re first of its kind Security Summit, that's the place that you're sponsored PGA Fortinet championship event. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing -- what you're seeing from a customer traction perspective, post the event. And perhaps if the event had led to a notable uptick in visibility and mindshare among customers. Keith Jensen : I think the head of marketing asked that question. But it's a good question. Ken Xie : It's probably one of the biggest marketing investments we have been made, but definitely see Barb worse except for advance will result. A lot of customer and a lot of pun that, really appreciate all these -- fully that champing PGA had a beer.  And also we using it as a platform to bring different customer upon altogether, to share, communicate their experience and also to the training education. And so we do see this is already helping a lot of the marketing sales  we have and also generate a lot of  put in this way. Is more successful event. Keith Jensen : I would come over the topic and completely echo, and what Ken had to say. I've just -- I'm shocked at how enthusiastic I am about how that event came out. Whether we look at, what we call whitespace names that, we got from, say SMP 500. The percentage of attendees that were non-customers, and it was sit with us on one-to-one sessions and hear more about our story and the household names that were there, it was fantastic.  I think the branding with the marketing team pulled together with that, together with Silverado Country Club, was extremely successful. And I think also, it goes back to some of the comments we made earlier in the conversation. I think it was -- it really struck Fortinet at the right time in terms of its call its maturity, right? I think that the team here was, really in a good position to execute against that.  I was in a customer meeting yesterday here in Sunnyvale, with a very large Company that come to the event. And so it was a follow-up. And there have been other very large companies that have come to our ABC events here in Sunnyvale. And just in the first month and a half after the event, I'm just really impressed with what the guys did. Guys and ladies between. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thanks for the color. Keith Jensen : Yeah Operator :  Next we have Keith Bachman from BMO. Your line is now open. Keith Bachman : Thank you very much. I was -- wanted to direct this towards Keith. Keith, as you think about the billings guide, what you're suggesting EBITDA high-end, the billings' sequential growth would be about 13% in the past 2 years, you've grown billing sequentially, about 28%. So obviously a little less on the guide. I'm just wondering if you could just give us some color or thoughts around that.  And in particular, is that a reflection of -- was there any kind of pull in that you think about on the billings, were customers concerned about not getting product? And/or is it reflecting some of the concerns you previously mentioned about are we going to have enough of the supply chain availability or product availability I should say. And therefore, we might need to tamp down a little bit in Q4. And then I have a follow-up if I could, because Peter told me I'm allowed to ask a follow-up. Keith Jensen : Again. Look, I think what you're seeing there is supply chain. And as I said earlier in the conversation, that I think they -- we've been appropriately conservative, I hope, in terms of how we guided to it. To unpack that, just a little bit, we do with our sales team, and we manage things on a bookings basis with them. And then we put that up against what we have the ability to ship.  If I look at just the bookings number and we had a long internal conversation about whether or not that's a metric that we should provide in this time and decided not to. But if we look at just the bookings number, I would say that, it's a very strong indicator that the business is extremely healthy, if you will.  In terms of customer buying behavior there's always somebody getting in line early, if you will. That they have longer-term deployment or what have you. That's not new and maybe a little bit of it in the third quarter, no deal is over $10 million or they are the largest deal with probably seven or eight or something like that in the quarter.  We have seen in the fourth-quarter things where customers I'd say they are getting line orders. They've got deployments where our plans for deploying in 2022. And they want to make sure that, they're trying to time, when they are actually going to need the product and when the product is going to be available. So I have seen early in the quarter, a few companies exhibiting that behavior. Keith Bachman : We're hearing that a little bit from the channel, not the lead times, because they're getting out, customers are ordering early in more. But it sounds like what you're saying, essentially you are concerned about maybe the billings number reflects some -- you might not be able to make all shipment demand and so that's reflected in the quarter from -- I hope I'm not putting words in your mouth. Keith Jensen : No, absolutely. I think that would be a very prudent thing to say, with the supply train environment that we're in, I'm not just going to take the -- I can't just take the absolute booking number to shift, but I think there's been a fair amount of internal work around that if you will, now, on the other side, it does give us more predict more predictability as we come into 2022 of this behavior continues. So we've had in the past.  Backlog or bookings has not been something that -- Ford as a Company has really had reason or cause to talk about. And I don't know that as of today that we do. But as we get further into the fourth quarter and then moving into 2022, that maybe something that because of the predictability that it helps with, we may be talking about that next year. Keith Bachman : Okay. And my Peter -sanctioned second question then, is if you talk a little bit about the non-FortiGate mix. And I know you mentioned that in one of the previous questions, but how do you see that changing over the course of the next couple of quarters, if at all? And I'm not really talking about a supply chain constraint, but just on demand related pools.  As customers may look as they're deploying that incremental 6,000 customers and greater penetration on your existing -- do you see the software side moving up, if you will, in the non-FortiGate component. And then I will cede the floor. Thank you. Ken Xie : That's where what do we call Fabry on mash. We see put his strong demand from a customer and we both increased the amount repurchase also the customer about that anything new multiple products, Fabry are matched solution. So that's where we Canadian few hall restaurant growth sound non-op 40-k. And Also we said we'll can be assemblies provide a carrier on the SaaS east and modest solution. You eventually will also benefit broader customer base. Keith Bachman : Okay. All right. Many thanks and congratulations for the incredible results. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Peter Zarkowski for closing remarks. Peter Zarkowski : Thank you, Eli.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations is located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today\u2019s remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. For the fourth quarter, bookings increased 49% to $1.420 billion. Billings increased 36% to $1.306 billion. Global G2000 billings growth accelerated to over 90%. Q-on-Q billings was up 67%, accounting for 16% of total billings. Total revenue growth, 29% to $964 million with product revenue up 31%. Our team navigated well through a challenging supply chain environment to deliver outstanding results. For the full year, revenue was $3.3 billion and GAAP operation margin was 20%. We generated a record of $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we recorded our 13th consecutive year of GAAP profitability. Three growth drivers, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation with a security fabric match platform and an elevated threat environment are driving our strong financial results and market share gains. The move to Work from Anywhere has rapidly expanded the attack surface, which traditionally network security found hard to protect. Fortinet Security driven networking approach converges networking of security, including next-generation firewall, SD-WAN, 5G,  and OT to reduce capacity, while securing and connecting remote user to advance security and performance and a networking speed -- are increasingly consolidating to a cybersecurity match approach. Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers unparalleled protection through a cybersecurity match architecture that provide broad, integrated and ultimate protection across multiple edge from endpoint to data center and hybrid cloud environment. Today, we announced a FortiGate 2000, the latest FortiGate next changing firewall, powered by Fortinet basic NP7 SPU to deliver sustainable, high-performance convergence of networking and security for zero trust edge and core network. The FortiGate 2009 secure computing routing offers an average 5x better performance than competitive offerings. Fortinet recently stood out amongst 19 network firewall vendors into a critical capability for network firewall. We evaluated the performance across non-critical capability. Fortinet FortiGate solution received overall high score in the enterprise data center, distributed enterprise edge and SMB use case and the second highest score in public cloud use case. Our FortiGate product is the only leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrant for network firewall and SD-WAN. Over the last several years, Fortinet's industry-leading innovation has transformed our company into one of the most influential and fastest-growing cybersecurity leaders. This, in addition to our growth drivers, strongly position us to capture market share and move to the next level of growth. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, and we especially like to send our operations team for doing a great job supporting Fortinet fast growth. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our very strong 2021 performance. Customer demand was strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting the three key demand drivers that Ken mentioned, convergence of security and networking, vendor consolidation on our Security Fabric mesh platform and the elevated threat environment. Convergence or security-driven networking requires integrated security solutions to be delivered at networking speeds across the company's entire threat landscape of edges, including data centers, endpoints, work from anywhere and clouds, as well as across multiple use cases such as secure SD-WAN, WiFi, switching, 5G and OT. The networking speed and computing capabilities of our ASIC-powered for gates can be 5 to 10 times more than competitor firewalls with their off-the-shelf silicon products. Vendor consolidation is driven by customer focus on security effectiveness, performance and cost management. We deliver vendor consolidation through our Security Fabric platform and its broad range of products integrated with a single operating system, offering increased automation. As we saw in 2021, we expect strong customer demand fueled by these key drivers to continue. And turning to our 2021 performance, billings growth accelerated to 35% or $4.2 billion, representing our highest annual billings growth rate in six years. Revenue growth also accelerated coming in at 29%, representing the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. And despite the supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in 37% growth, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in 10 years. Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, non-FortiGate billings and revenue each exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Non-FortiGate billings increased 46% to $1.25 billion, and non-FortiGate revenue increased 42% to $1.1 billion. Gross margin was 77.5% and operating margin was 26.2%. Our GAAP operating margin was 19.5%. It's one of the highest in the industry. Our near GAAP profitable, as Ken mentioned, for 13 consecutive years. Free cash flow was a record $1.2 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our history. Free cash flow margin was 36%. And when adjusted for real estate investments came in at 43%. Total deferred revenue increased 33% to $3.5 billion, and short-term deferred revenue increased 28% to $1.8 billion. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that exceeds supply by more than historical norms. As a result, we are expanding our disclosures to include bookings and backlog to provide greater visibility into the strength of our business. Bookings represent the value of all orders received from customers. Backlog represents the value of all orders received but not fulfilled. When the order is fulfilled, we recognize both billings and product revenue. Turning to Q4 results. As noted on Slide 4, bookings were $1.4 billion, up 49%. On a sequential basis, backlog increased $122 million due to very strong demand. On a year-over-year basis, backlog increased $150 million to end the year at $162 million. Breaking down the backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong, it should provide a tailwind of growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a, say, a low single-digit percentage of backlog. Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system are not commodities really changed with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and for the most employed security network solution over one-third of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer from any suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage may be difficult for our competition to match. And I apologize for the sound in the background, we don't know what's causing it, but I'll continue on. Moving to Q4 billings of $1.3 billion, billings are up 36%, which compares to 49% bookings in noted earlier. Enterprises favorites Fortinet's leading cost performance and integrated platform. This is especially evident in the 5-point increase in the large enterprise billing mix. Add more color to this, we could share, global 2000 buildings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100 deal threshold for time in our history. We saw a record of four low eight-figure transactions in the quarter, all in the Americas. And lastly\u2026 Peter Salkowski : We're going to take 202 second we can mix the phone line. We think it might be our phone for some reason. We're going to dial back in and be right back. Everybody else, stayput. Operator : Please remain online. Your conference will resume shortly. Peter Salkowski : Josh, can you hear us? Operator : Yes, I can hear you. You're in the main room right now. And I can still hear these sounds. Peter Salkowski : Josh? Operator : I'm sorry, but the sound is still coming in pretty bad. Peter Salkowski : Okay. We're going to drop this line. We\u2019ll be right back. Operator : Please remain online. Your conference will resume shortly. Peter Salkowski : Josh, we're back. Can you hear me? Josh, can you hear me? Operator : Hello. Yes, I can hear you, but the noise came back as soon as you got connected again. Peter Salkowski : Yeah. We're at a totally different line. I\u2019m on my cellphone now. It sounds like it's on your end, guys. Operator : Let me chat with you on and we'll get in just a moment. Peter Salkowski : Okay. Put everybody on hold, please. Operator : I will put the music, hold back on the call. You are connected that at this time, sir. You may proceed. Peter Salkowski : Josh, are you there. Okay. All right. We're going to start. Keith's going to back up a little bit. Hopefully, you can hear us now, and we'll start where he kind of left off and go from there. Apologies for the interlude there. Keith Jensen : I'll back up a couple of paragraphs to my best recollection of where the challenge started. So -- and I believe that was around when I was mentioning that we were breaking down our backlog between product and services, approximately 75% relates to product -- future product shipments, while the remaining 25% relates to various services. While it's difficult to forecast if an order might be canceled, several factors support our view that our backlog is strong and should provide a tailwind for growth later this year and into next year. Existing customers account for approximately 90% of our backlog. No single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog. Many competitors are also impacted by supply chain constraints. Our products, along with our integrated operating system, are not commodities readily exchanged with offerings from other vendors. We actively manage our own supply chain and is the most deployed network security solution with over one-third of all firewall unit shipments, we are an attractive volume buyer for many suppliers. And lastly, our price for performance advantage can be difficult for our competition to match. Moving to Q4 billings. At $1.3 billion, billings were up 36%, which compares to the 49% bookings growth noted earlier. Enterprise favored Fortinet's leading cost for performance and integrated platform. This was especially evident in the five-point increase in the large enterprise billings mix. To add more color to this, we can share that Global 2000 billings were up over 90%, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The number of deals over $1 million increased 79% to 122 deals, breaking the 100-plus deal threshold for the first time in our history. We saw a record of four low figure, eight-figure transactions, all in the Americas in the quarter. And lastly, Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased 63% to 26%, contributing to SD-WAN use case billings growth of 67% and putting SD-WAN at 16% of total billings. FortiGate billings were up 33% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on slide 11, high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. Non-FortiGate billings were up 43%, driving 1.5 points mix shift to non-FortiGate. Top 10 non-FortiGate solutions with growth over 40% included virtual firewalls, endpoints and switches. At the same time, several smaller solutions posted triple digit growth rates. Consistent with the elevated threat environment and the breadth of ransomware and other attacks, OT use case billings were up 70% and accounted for 8% of total billings. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter at 28 months. For the third consecutive quarter, we added approximately 6,000 new logos. Worldwide government buildings grab the largest share of the mix at 16%. Financial services accounted for 14% of billings on billings growth of 63%. Billings and manufacturing, transportation, utilities, construction and other verticals that have not consistently been in our top five remained elevated with billings growth of 40%. We believe the growth of these verticals is an indication of the broadening nature and greater awareness of the threat landscape, which is driving cybersecurity investments in industries that have historically perhaps spent a little bit less on security budgets. Moving over to the income statement. Revenue growth was 29%. Product revenue growth was 31%, illustrating the impact of backlog on product revenue growth. If backlog had remained flat quarter-over-quarter, the product revenue growth would have been as high as the mid-60s. Service revenue was up 27% to $585 million. Support and related services revenue was up 31% to $275 million, while security subscription services were up 24% to $309 million. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue of $324 million grew 41% and accounted for approximately 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. FortiGate product and services revenue of $639 million grew 23% and accounted for 66% of total revenue. Total gross margin of 77.3% was 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. A lower-than-expected drag from acquisitions and pricing actions taken to offset supplier cost increases contributed to the better-than-expected total gross margin and product gross margin. Product gross margin of 62.1% increased 140 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin of 87.1% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.5% improved 270 basis points sequentially and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 100 basis points. Better-than-expected gross margin performance and a slightly less-than-expected impact from acquisitions contributed to the better-than-expected operating margin. Headcount increased 24% to 10,195. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 12 and 15. Capital expenditures were $151 million, including $129 million for real estate investments. Our capital strategy includes increasing our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a cost of 541 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for a cost of 742 million. At year-end, the remaining share authorization was approximately $1.5 billion and set to expire in February of 2023. Inventory turns at 2.7 were flat year-over-year and on par with 2.9 times in the prior quarter. Overall, what we believe was better than market growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we believe we again gained market share. Supported by a strong pipeline growth and the key growth drivers outlined earlier, we believe we are in the early innings of a sustained high growth period for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet, driven by digital transformation, hybrid cloud and the moving of data and security to the edge. The products we've created, the channel and customer relationships we've developed and the investments we've made to build a broad and integrated security fabric platform powered by our proprietary Hasek FortiGates, are expected to drive our continued growth and market share gains. Now I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter summarized on slide 16, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For at least the first half of the year, we expect elevated demand to outpace supply chain capacity, increasing backlog, an increase in backlog as a headwind to billings and revenue growth and provides interim pressure on margins. For the first quarter, assuming bookings in the range of $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 32%, we expect billings in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.90 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%; revenue in the range of $865 million to $895 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5% to 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.80, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate first quarter capital expenditures to be between $140 million and $150 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18%. Before providing our full year 2022 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every member of the Fortinet team for the truly outstanding execution in 2021. The efforts and results have been outstanding and this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. In 2022, we expect a small shift in our seasonality towards the second half of the year by two or three points. And for the full year, assuming bookings in the range of $5.580 billion to $5.680 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%, we expect billings in the range of $5.400 billion to $5.480 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 29%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.685 billion to $2.715 billion, which represents growth of approximately 29% and implies full year product -- implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 27, non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.85 to $5, which assumes a share count of between $169 million and $171 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $210 million. Lastly, I want to inform everyone that this we will be holding an Analyst Day on May 10 coinciding with Accelerate 2022, where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and outstanding success. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. As a reminder everyone, please limit yourself to one question on how we lost a little time there due to the technical delays, apologies for all of that. But operator, can you open it up for Q&A, please? Operator : Sure. Thank you, sir.  I show our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and thank you. Congratulations on a nice set of results. Thanks as well for the additional disclosure. And I guess maybe on that point, maybe could you help us understand what qualifies as a booking and from a timing perspective if an order is placed with a timing event maybe nine months from now, is that still included in bookings? And then maybe any other incremental color you can provide us on the supply chain management? How you're managing the supply chain? You mentioned pricing increases offsetting an incremental supplier costs. But maybe a view on are the issues abating at all? Are lead times still consistent with where they were last quarter? And any other nuances we should be aware of, like channel partners pre-buying inventory, which is one of the things that we picked up a little bit this quarter? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. A lot of good stuff there. I don't know if we'll get couple of... Brian Essex : I keep in one question. Keith Jensen : Yes, I know you did really well. Keep in mind, our business model, right? End users buy from resellers who buy from distributors who buy from us. So it's not like a very large complex $50 million solution that's going to be deployed over time. When we get orders, it's typically the customers want the product. So I don't know that we would see something like we described at the beginning of the conversation in terms of order bookings. For us, booking as a distributor sends an order to us, and they would like to have shipment throughout if we -- so that counts the booking. And if we ship it, then it's becomes a building and it becomes product revenue. And if we don't, it becomes backlog. I'll just pause at that was, sorry. So in terms of supply chain and maybe Ken would offer some additional thoughts on that. I do -- we talked previously, I think that we felt that September, October and maybe very early in November could turn out to be the low watermark for supply chain challenges, at least in terms of what we call decommitments from our contract manufacturers and from our component suppliers. And I think that, to this point, is shown to be the case. We do still from time to time, have the commitments, but they're much, much smaller than they were back in that time frame. I think the general tone, if you will, with our channel, whether there's components here as contract manufacturers, is much, much better than it was. We do, like everybody else, we read the reports, and we see conversations and commentary around things like -- particularly in consumer electronics, where there be some improvement in auto manufacturing. I think we have reason to believe that the situation continues to improve as we move forward. At the same time, working extremely closely with our suppliers, conversations at very high levels and talking about maybe some longer-term projects that we may work on together, for example, making them aware of what our volume of business is and also a bit of a tip of the capital or engineering team, who's been going through the process of redesigning and recertifying some of the components and some of the other changes, if you will. All of that, I think, kind of gives us a feeling that the second half of this year should see improvement. Ken? Ken Xie : Yes. I think you commented all of them. I think is different compared to most of our competitors, we handle the design, manufacture operation, put them out directly ourselves. And also we have a bigger quantity compare to our competitors can better negotiate with suppliers. And also the engineering also starting -- last year also starting redesigned some of the product to award a certain shortage of the component, which are working well with us, but some of them may take about six months. I think overall, that's what we feel pretty confident in the second half of this year since we'll be improving both because the supply chain itself and also some alternative design and also kind of better planning. I have to say last quarter, the demand was very, very strong, with booking grew 49%, which even kind of beyond -- kind of our planning. So that's caused some of the shortage. But overall, we have a much better shape compared to competitors in the inventory and in the supply. And also the other question, we don't see increased inventory in the channel in the distributor there, pretty much the same as they have in the last few years. So we don't see any increase of the channel to setup the product. So that's not the case for us. Keith Jensen : Yeah. And Brian such a good job of only answering one question, I'm going to jump also in and give some more color on it. I do -- did somebody orders a product early, some place in the world? Sure. I'm sure that happened. When we try and look at our own business, we try to identify possibilities of that happening. And the best number we can come up with is something that represents extremely low single digits of our business may have been impacted by that. And at the same time, you immediately pivot over to look at your pipeline. And even if that was happening, it's certainly not evident in the pipeline. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline growth. And then just a follow on to Ken's comment about distributor inventory levels, again, with our model, we do have visibility of the inventory that's in the channel. And that inventory -- those inventory levels are actually down a little bit year-over-year. So I don't think we're seeing the types of things that maybe you may have some concerns about. Ken Xie : Yeah. And also the shortage more limit and pretty much most limited in the very low end and -- so the middle and the high end FortiGate, we do have enough inventory even for the more strong like 49% billing growth. And also, we have a very broad product portfolio. So there's a lot of alternative product. The customer, the channel controls. And at the same time, something redesigned already working, it will be ready in a few months. Brian Essex : Fantastic color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from Citi. Please go ahead. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Keith, let me focus this one for you. At the risk of oversimplification, I know you've given us the bookings growth. You've given us the billings growth and certainly, the product growth and the guidance for fiscal 2022. So between the 49% growth you saw in bookings, 36% billings growth that you saw this quarter and the 31% in product. Can you talk us through how that is dovetailing into your guidance for next year? And frankly, how much of this backlog you're expecting to amortize into your revenue and billings profile over the course of 2022? And as related to that, I understand you've taken some pretty substantial pricing increases for your subscription packages for the portfolio. I'm curious how much of that is contemplated in your guidance across these metrics? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Okay. I think Brian set the standard and Fatima is following it through. How many questions will account as one? Because I start with the easy one first pricing. We raised prices. We've talked about before prices in August and again in November. On our price list, keep in mind, those get discounted down. The price -- because services, whether it's support or security, attaches -- the pricing attaches to the box, so to speak. When you raise prices on the appliance, you're also effectively raising prices on the services. But then if you think through revenue recognition, obviously, you'll get some -- you'll get the price increase in revenue for the product more currently than you will for the services you're going to recognize that over time. And I think your question of what are we expecting in terms of backlog and amortization or what have you? As you can imagine, we've done a fair amount of scenario planning to go through the year. And I don't know that there is a one scenario that we would point to as opposed to a combination of scenarios. I think you can kind of solve for that maybe not on the phone right now, with some of the information that we've provided in terms of our expectation for backlog increasing, right, for the year. And so backlog is increasing for the year, I don't think that would be reflective of us bleeding into the income statement backlog that currently exists. The components of the backlog will shift, but net-net, it's going up. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, guys. Great numbers. I had a clarification and a question. Just on -- Keith, on the 2-point shift in seasonality in the second half. Is that just tied to supply chain fulfillment? I just want to make sure I got that right. And there's no other cause here? And then, Ken, maybe you could talk about, from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing any changes? And I wonder if you have any thoughts with respect to CheckPoint's recent introduction of their Lightspeed firewall, which is extremely price aggressive? How do you think about that in the market? Any thoughts there would be great? Keith Jensen : Yes, I'll just come quickly on the linearity. We just wanted to make sure we open the door to have the conversation with you guys about how linearity may be a little bit different this year than what has been historically for us. And yes, you can point back to the supply chain on that. Ken Xie : Yes. I also mentioned the Checkpoint earnings this morning. I probably sent to deal we mentioned Fortinet. And so their newest product, probably like 20% faster than Fortinet product 1800 app, but that's the product we released more than two years ago. I think based on Moore\u2019s law. So every two year \u2013 every 18 months, the speed will double. So I think the latest product a much faster now. So I do see because the \u2013 we see security-driven networking conversion of network and security. So the network security started deploy pretty much in all the infrastructure, not just secure the border. So when we deployed internally at a much higher speed and that's where the high-speed firewalls needed to do the internal segmentation, security server, segment, different department, all these kind of things. So that's where we see quite a strong demand in milestone growth with the current ransomware environment. But also, we see that with working from anywhere, a lot of our users have to connect remotely or kind of connect remotely. So that's where the security SD-WANs and 5G market also see very strong demand. So that's what we see. We're leading innovation in both space with our own ASIC with all the secure SD-WAN 5G connection. It's a much bigger total addressable market compared to the traditional network security. So that's where we identify as over $170 billion total addressable market for us in the next three, four years. It's a huge potential and market large enough pretty much for all the competitors to compete, but definitely have to keep up the innovation, keep up the change to keeping gaining market share. Ittai Kidron : Got it. Very good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Cowen. Please go ahead. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats. I'll behave myself limiting to one question. Back to the supply chain, Keith, I just want to make sure, is that predominantly non-FortiGate products, or do we have some FortiGate products also included in that entire supply chain discussion? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yeah. And I think Ken touched upon that a little bit. I'll just build it out for little more clarity. If you look at more traditional, what we call secure networking products such as switches and access points, you're looking at probably something in the order of 60%, maybe two-thirds of the backlog would fit into that category, and the remainder is in FortiGate. And then Ken was making sure that we understood that. Within FortiGate, roughly one-third, the majority of that is in the entry level or low end FortiGates. We're not really experiencing the same pressure in the midrange and the high end that we see in the low end. Shaul Eyal : Thanks guys. Peter Salkowski : And then operator, just a quick one. I just want to let everybody know on the call, given the technical difficulties we had earlier, we'll post the prepared remarks about the CEO script and the CFO script to the IR website as soon as we can after the call. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Ben Bollin : Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Ken or Keith, when you think about the elevated demand and placements on the product front, can you share any thoughts about how coincident that demand is or leading as it relates to additional fabric traction? Any thoughts or hooks around number of applications that are being deployed typically with that initial rollout versus what comes later? Thanks. Ken Xie : We see a lot of enterprise they need to protect their internal network because its ransomware attack like we released that we served a few months ago, is 11 times higher on the ransomware attack compared to one years ago. So there\u2019s big demand to secure the company, whole infrastructure. Also working -- I think we also need more security, especially like secure SD-WAN, secure 5G, all these connections. So we see -- the demand is very, very strong. So that's where -- and also for supply for some other chip manufacturer, even with our own chip, usually, there's a lead time. So that's where we see the backlog and we're hoping we'll be -- go back, I hope will be more normal towards the end of the year. Keith Jensen : Yeah. Hi, Ben. How are you? Ken's pointing at me, so I'll follow-up a little bit. I think in terms of pull-through of non-FortiGate products, maybe I kind of came to the conversation a few years ago thinking that that was going to be more of a commercial and mid-enterprise area where we see the quantity. In actuality, it seems to move with customer size. The SMB is somewhat limited as we still see other products attaching and building that out. And then the mid enterprise, the enterprise, and then the service providers are very strong buyers of multiple products. And I think that why that's relevant is that's the affirmation of the platform strategy. I think they very early on realized the overhead cost of managing point solutions from different vendors could be fairly onerous, and that was pretty challenging. And so it is moving its way through the rest of the customer chain, if you will. I think the other thing that's happening more currently now is we've seen -- we talk about these other verticals that represent not in the top five, but coming to the table and buying security. And I think they're very clear with us in conversations that I've had with them and Ken as well that they're looking for a total solution. And the ability to cobble together a series of integrated products into one solution. Not only does that save them in terms of the initial purchase, but also the management cost. So I do think there's definitely a tailwind in that area. Ken Xie : Yes. The other meditation point is really the Global 2000 account grow over 90%, so it's almost double year-over-year, a very strong demand in there. Ben Bollin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hamza Fodderwala : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about just the appliance demand more broadly. Maybe a question for Ken. How do you think about the demand for hardware between factors like return to office, campus refresh, data center? What's really driving that appliance as we go through 2022? Ken Xie : I think the convergence of network and security will be long-term and I think during the pandemic and even after pandemic, you see a lot of things changing, whether the working environment or more access, that's what the zero trust in starting to build up very demand there. And also internally, they need to secure the whole infrastructure both in the -- within the like campus network, data center or remote in connecting branch office. So that's where we see the whole infrastructure need to be secured. And also kind of consolidation among different vendors also starting happening more quickly because like Keith mentioned, the management cost is very high, if they have a different vendor for different part of cybersecurity. So that's where the vendor can provide more product integrate, automate together definitely has more advantage and lower and total management cost. Actually, that's why we see the, like I mentioned, the three driver convergence of our network and security and the consolidation of the vendor and at the same time, the strong elevated server security threat right now, especially like ransomware is a big impact to the business is all driving the strong growth. Hamza Fodderwala : Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes, I would say that I think one of the things that Ken ask us to go look at was what our product revenue growth has been if we didn't have backlog, right? And that's that kind of who knows when they call out with that point, but it was 65% or 66% product revenue growth if we had the product to deliver. I mean that's a huge number. And I think it speaks to the kind description of this is -- the demand is extremely high for appliances right now. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Keith, one for you. If I'm looking at it correct, if it wasn't for the gross margin pressure, it looks like operating margins would have expanded nicely in 2022. And I'm curious with things like return to office, maybe a pickup in business travel and maybe even wage inflation, how are you able to deliver that kind of underlying margin expansion in the operating line? Keith Jensen : I don't -- for 2022 versus 2021, I think we're guiding to 24% to -- I think we're guiding to basically 25% at the midpoint and just closed out a year at\u2026 Peter Salkowski : 26%. Keith Jensen : 26%. I don't know that that's up. Sterling, you mind thinking about that? Peter Salkowski : I think if the gross margin was down. Keith Jensen : On the operating -- the leverage is coming through on the operating expenses. Sterling Auty : Yeah. Exactly. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think that while you can look at the percentages in terms of what we're spending, I think sales productivity in the current environment is probably the biggest driver, if you will, in terms of the leverage that we get out of this. Obviously, if you go back to 2021, not a lot of sales productivity probably in 2020. With COVID, very nice sales productivity numbers in 2021. Now we're looking at tailwinds. I must be honest, the price increases will indeed increase sales productivity. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Okay. Peter Salkowski : Thanks Sterling. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Please go ahead. Adam Borg : Hi guys, and thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just an SD-WAN, it's great to see the strength there continuing -- maybe you could comment just on, I guess, first the sustainability of those trends in coming years. And are you seeing this growth coming more from greenfield opportunities or some brownfield displacements? Thanks so much. Ken Xie : It's pretty broad. As you can look at SD-WAN, probably, I'd say, more than half majority products go to the middle or high end range. And at the same time, a lot of enterprise customers, a lot of are all starting using leverage SD-WAN. So it's quite a broad -- much more beyond the retail. Peter Salkowski : Operator, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please go ahead. Jonathan Ho : Hi, good afternoon. And let me echo my congratulations on the strong quarter. Yeah, I guess, just given that you've delivered a quarter that's been particularly strong this year. Can you give us a bit of a sense of what's happening with the pipeline? And maybe what is giving you the confidence that you can continue to drive that sustained growth for several more years. I think you've gone through some of the factors one by one, but what are you seeing in the immediate term that allows you to continue growing at these rates? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yeah, I\u2019m looking at Ken who wants to get more strategic. I'll give you a very tactical conversation about it. And Peter is making a shameless plug for the Analyst Day in May and saying that we'll talk about that then. Look, I'm really, really pleased with what the pipeline looks like at the moment. We go through our use we've talked before, I think, Jonathan, is slicing and dicing it in terms of how much our new customers, renewals, expansions inside customers, what's the deal size? What's the geography? And it's -- I don't want to just loss over some of the numbers that we saw in the enterprise segment in the fourth quarter. I think we're at 90% growth on the G2000 for three quarters in a row. The U S. did extremely well and without getting into a lot of details, they too accelerated for three quarters in a row. Looking at the pipeline and looking at again, more enterprise growth that's coming, I think we have a good position in SMB, love the execution. We've had some people in other settings comment upon, the maturity that the sales and marketing and execution level has reached now as a company. So I think the pipeline in our ability to execute, I don't see why that would change. Ken Xie : Yes. And also, we have a lot of growth potential in the Global 2000. So like we said last year -- last quarter grown at 90% year-over-year. And also, this is the bigger account, you also can upsell, cross-sell a lot of other products. So we do see the pipeline is very, very strong. And also we're keeping enhance in the marketing and keeping pretty aggressively higher net sales and the sales capacity. So far some regions, some of the vertical, we still have much less capacity than some of our competitors. I think with the additional marketing sales capacity, we do see the growth will continue in the next few years. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from KeyBank. Please go ahead. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. Thanks, Keith, for making the statement of demand very high for appliances. I guess I'd just like to reask Hamza\u2019s question about the sources of demand for appliances right now, particularly in the context though of how strong cloud is. I mean, we just had very strong cloud numbers coming in from Amazon as well as from others. So how should we really understand why so much is being spent in physical boxes right now as opposed to even some of your products that are in the cloud? Ken Xie : I probably one common deal mentioned this morning in the call, definitely, the network security is a much bigger total addressable market. The cloud security ported by 2025, it is little bit over $20 billion and compared to current total addressable market, including network security, converting network security, endpoint or the other will be $170 billion. It's a much bigger market. And at the same time, there's a lot of innovation going on and have to secure the whole infrastructure. So that's where we see the price also even access the cloud, you need all these appliance. You also need this SD-WAN, 5G connection, all this to access the cloud. So that's where we see the. There's a huge market potential in the very fragmented market. There\u2019s a lot of growth potential. Michael Turits : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing now, we have time for one more question coming from Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Keith Bachman : Yes, I'm going to ask a similar question to Michael before. Your product revenue growth has been 40%, 50% and now the underlying growth this quarter was north of 60%. Your competitors are also experiencing good product revenues, not nearly to the extent that you are. And so it's more than Checkpoint that's experiencing demand and it's more than the \u2013 what I characterize as the consolidation when you're taking share from the likes of Cisco and SD-WAN. And so I'm trying to understand, if you thought about the aggregate demand is in the last three quarters have been far exceeded anything that's happened in, say, the last five years between not only yourself, but your three primary competitors ex-Cisco. And so the question is, if traffic is normally one of the key drivers, but what are some other drivers for not just yourself, but for the three primary vendors? Just trying to understand that really, I think, consistent with some of the other questions about the durability of demand not just for yourself but for the industry in general? Ken Xie : Yes. I think the industry I do believe, they need to start to secure the whole infrastructure, both internal LAN and also the WAN connection put outside. And that also like we see very, very strong demand to secure inside the company and also like all this data center or this internal segmentation, which is before the network security is too slow to deploy in the high-speed environment internally. And then also the SD-WAN, you can see pretty strong growth. And -- I think the overall convergence of repeating the network or security, that's the suite driver we gave out. I think probably in the Analyst Day, Peter, Keith mentioned, May 10th. So we'll probably give some more details on data and analysis and we'll see how long. I do believe this will be pretty long-term changing in the whole space where we were keeping growth in the next five to 10 years. And also ASIC advantage and the continue scale and scope all starting working for us because we have the quantity, which helping lower per chip cost, which none of our competitors have. And also, we're probably the only company-only chip. And we also leverage any other commercial chip available, including all the -- whatever Intel, MV, GPU, TPU,IPU other things we're using, but we have unique advantage of our own ASIC chip, which help in drive over high-speed, low-cost network security solution. On the other side, the economy of scope also working, because we have like a set some different product harbor, we call the fabric and now on mesh that basically mesh architecture, which is helping us to cross-sell, I think last quarter is the first time the over 30%. I think right now, it's a FortiGate count about 69%, non-FortiGate 41% and also over $1 billion last year. Also see very, very strong growth, grow faster than the FortiGate. So that's also helping to supporting the whole infrastructure security, converging on network and security and also elevate the threat environment. Keith Jensen : Thanks very much for the question. Shameless on Peter for continuing to plug\u2026 Keith Bachman : Thank you. Keith Jensen : Early in the life cycle of cybersecurity industry, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where firewalls had a very specific use and the environment, if you will, is more stable, it may be easier to identify refresh cycles that we keep looking for and have not yet seen in the last five years. And I think that's perhaps going back to Ken's point, I think that's because the environment is not stable at all. I think the reality is what you're seeing out there right now in terms of use cases and data volumes, data is all over the place -- and it's lots and lots of data. It's just getting more and more. And the use cases, I mean, five years ago, a lot of things that were air gaped away from the Internet aren't anymore. And now you see -- it's probably what's probably the manufacturing vertical for us. I just -- I don't know that you can presume that the environment, so to speak, and the political interest in it, the insurance company is interested in it, CIOs management team is interested in that. It is a hot topic of conversation. So even if you are due for a refresh cycle in the industry, and I don't know that we are, I don't think you're going to see that because of what's happening in the world out there. Keith Bachman : All right. Okay. Thank you gentlemen. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski for any closing comments. Please go ahead. Peter Salkowski : Thank you. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties today. As I said earlier, we are planning to post the prepared remarks up on our website as soon as we can. So you can see all the numbers that Keith shared that I think help answer some of the questions with regards to bookings backlog and the sustainable growth in our business. I'd also like to remind everybody we'll be at the Morgan Stanley conference on March 9th, an in-person conference, our first and gosh, I don't even know how long. Fireside chat at the event and the webcast link for that -- for the Morgan Stanley conference will be on our Investor Relations website for you all to listen. Do you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you very much for your time. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Ken and Keith's prepared remarks today for the earnings call will be posted on the Quarterly Earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following today's call.  Lastly, all references to growth through on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding first quarter 2022 results. Our better-than-expected first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand of our cybersecurity innovation. Total revenue growth of 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Total billings increased 36%. Our strong results reflect new order that was significantly greater than anticipated, partially offset by an increase in backlog. As a result, bookings increased 50% year-over-year to 1,276 billion, which included booking growth for SD-WAN or 54%, Global 2000 growth of 61%, OT growth of 76%. For the quarter, net new backlog was 9% of bookings as we continue to navigate a challenging supply chain environment. We believe that the hybrid network adhere for foreseeable future, and Fortinet is pushing the boundary of what is possible with innovation to enable customers to successfully operate in today's elevated threat environment. Our solid performance and market share gains are being driven by our effort to make our customers our entire infrastructure more secure and integrate in a zero trust network. Fortinet as secure-driven network approach converged networking functionality with security capability fueled by our powerful for ASIC SPU to provide the best performance and rich functionality. The new FortiOS 7.2 offers multiple new and enhanced service across FortiGuard, FortiCare and FortiTrust such as VPNA, identity, demand unboxing, advanced device protection for OT and IoT environment, associated service and in-line capacity. And Fortinet provides one of the broadest security service offering and an average of half the cost compared to our main competitors. In addition, we have prioritized our most organic research and development efforts on integrating security product into our centralized FortiOS fabric platform, which Gartner refer to as a cybersecurity mesh architecture. Today, we announced a new suite of FortiGate powered by our food ASIC SPU, the FortiGate 3700-F,600-F and 700-F deliver high-performance converged networking and security, with security computer reaching of 5 times on average better performance than competitive offerings. During the quarter, we are pleased to review -- to receive the Gartner Peer Insight Customer Choice Award for both 1H infrastructure and next-generation firewall for three years in a row. Our innovation position Fortinet as one of the most influential cyber security leaders. These growth drivers and organic innovation is accelerating our growth potential to new level. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. It is their collective effort and a trust that will contribute into Fortinet's strong growth and market share gains. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Before adding to Ken's comments and going into more detail on our Q1 financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss a wording change in how we describe our business. FortiGate is now referred to as the core platform and non-FortiGate is now referred to as the platform extension. This change helps to emphasize the importance of our FortiOS operating system.  FortiOS drives our entire security platform across multiple platform extension use cases, including Zero Trust access, cloud security, security operations and secure networking. With that in mind, let's start with a more detailed Q1 discussion. Customer demand was again strong and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, use cases and security solutions, reflecting three key demand drivers, the elevated threat environment, convergence of security and networking and customers consolidating across our platform offerings. These key growth drivers are contributing to our strong results and accelerating pipeline growth. In short, we believe we are in a period of sustained high growth for the cybersecurity industry and Fortinet. Moving to the Q1 financial results. Total revenue of $955 million, was up 34%, driven by record product revenue growth of 54%. Taking into account an $80 million, sequential increase in product backlog. Product bookings growth was 87%. Product revenue growth was -- broad based with core platform and platform extension product revenue growth at 50% and 59%, respectively. While we continue to see robust product growth from our SD-WAN and operational technology, or OT, the core platform product revenue growth was mainly driven by the wide range of other use cases embedded in our operating system. Service revenue was up 24% to $584 million. Support and related services was up 26% to $271 million, while security subscription services revenue was up 23% to $313 million. To offer one observation about how customers may be responding to the supply chain challenges, we are seeing indications that a subset of customer\u2019s place product orders further in advance, and may have delayed purchases or registrations of the related service contracts. This, together with the timing differences with age product and service revenue recognition, creates a lag between product and service revenue growth rates. We expect quarterly service revenue growth to accelerate throughout the rest of the year. As summarized on Slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 32%. EMEA revenue increased 25%. And APAC posted revenue growth of 57%, which includes the contribution from AlaxalA. EMEA's growth includes the impact of suspending operations in Russia. Nonetheless, EMEA easily exceeded their internal targets.  Looking forward, EMEA's pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our EMEA business, despite the situation in Eastern Europe and its potential impact on European economies. Platform extension revenue grew 49% and accounted for 34% of total revenue, up 3 percentage points. Moving to bookings, backlog and billings. We are experiencing exceptionally strong demand, demand that continues to exceed supply by more than historical norms. Bookings were up 50% to $1.3 billion, reflecting exceptional demand and a $116 million quarter-over-quarter increase in total backlog, bringing backlog to $278 million. Larger enterprises continue to favor Fortinet's industry-leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform strategy. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products. The following key metrics illustrate growing demand from enterprise customers. Global 2000 bookings were up over 60%. Large enterprise bookings were up over 65%. Secure SD-WAN bookings grew 54%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong economic case. OT bookings were up 76%, illustrating the continued response to the elevated threat environment. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. However, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top line tailwind in future quarters. At $1.2 billion, billings were up 36%. Core platform billings were up 30%, and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 7, high end FortiGate posted very strong billings growth with a mix shifting 6 points towards high-end appliances. Platform extension billings were up 50% and accounted for 33% of total billings, up 3 percentage points. Average contract term was consistent year-over-year and down 1-month sequentially at 27 months. Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin was 74.4% as the revenue mix tilted 5 percentage points to product revenue from higher-margin services. Product gross margin of 57.4% reflects the impact of component and freight cost increases as well as higher less predictable component expedite fee expenses and the impact of consolidating AlaxalA\u2019s results. Service gross margin of 85.2% was impacted by AlaxalA, costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint and increased labor costs. Operating margin of 22% exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 200 basis points due to increased sales productivity and efficiencies in other OpEx areas offsetting the gross margin decline. Headcount increased 26% to 10,860. Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $273 million, representing a margin of 29%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $123 million, including $93 million for real estate investments. Adjusted for real estate purchases, our free cash flow margin was 38%. Our capital expenditure strategy includes investing in cloud and data center infrastructure, as well as our office and warehouse capacity to support our higher levels of growth. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $691 million. At the end of the quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $830 million, with the authorization set to expire in February 2023. Inventory turns at 3.5x were up nearly 1.5x year-over-year. Now let's spend some time reviewing backlog in a bit more detail. As I mentioned earlier, very strong demand for about $116 million increase in total backlog to $278 million. To put this in perspective, total backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately 6% of our trailing 12-months total billings. We shipped 60% of the Q4 ending hardware backlog in the quarter. In consistent with prior quarters -- the prior quarter, 73% of the backlog relates to expected future product shipments, while the remaining 27% relates to various services. We believe our backlog is very strong and should provide a billings and revenue tailwind to growth in future periods. And there are several reasons and comments we make to support our view, including: existing customers account for 93% of our backlog. And no single end customer accounts for more than a low single-digit percentage of backlog; there are 10 deals in backlog, 9 from existing customers with the remaining balance of over $1 million that together, account for less than 10% of total backlog. Remaining balances defined as the original order amount less the partial shipments we've made; just 5% of Q4 backlog was canceled in Q1, suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to our backlog. We do not believe that customers are meaningfully pivoting to software form factors from hardware. The software is frequently a more costly option and may require architectural redesign and investment and changes in form factors and other equipment beyond just the firewalls. We believe our competitors are similarly impacted by the supply chain. And finally, more customers are accepting the supply chain challenges and working with us to mitigate the issues by switching products, adjusting deployment schedules and accelerating evaluations of new products. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Our responses to these challenges include : significantly increasing inventory purchase commitments; redesigning products; qualifying additional suppliers; and working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions. We expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect component and logistics costs remain elevated and backlog to increase through the course of the year.  As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing pressure to gross margins. While the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. The outlook is also subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we anticipate bookings in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.385 billion, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 40%. And we expect billings in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.265 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $1.005 billion to $1.035 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 74.5% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23.5%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, which assumes a share count of $165 million to $167 million. We estimate second quarter capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. For the full year, we anticipate backlog could approach or possibly exceed $500 million, and expect billings in the range of $5.500 billion to $5.508 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 32.5%. The revenue in the range of $4.350 billion to $4.400 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 31%. This assumes the current supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year. Total service revenue in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, which represents growth of approximately 28%, and implies full year product revenue growth of approximately 36%. Given our current view of component costs and other supply chain pressures, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 74% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 to $5.15, which assumes a share count of between $166 million and $168 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures of between $270 million and $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $260 million. Lastly, I want to remind everyone that we'll be holding an Analyst Day on May 10, coinciding with Accelerate 2022. A link to register for the webcast is located on the Events and Presentation page of Fortinet's Investor Relations website. And along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers and all members of the Fortinet team for all their hard work, execution and success.  I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Peter Salkowski :  Operator, we can open the line please. Operator :  And our first question is from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Keith, a question for you is on the product revenue performance quarterly, one of the more standout metrics among others in the front. You gave us a sense of the top-down dynamics that are helping with respect to the demand environment, the threat environment and consolidation activity as it relates to discrete products. But from a bottom-up or a more micro perspective, can you talk to us about the net impact of the pricing increases that you've realized in the quarter? And if you can speak to linearity in the quarter, if there might potentially have been some acceleration or pull forward of demand that you might have seen later on in the year? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think the color I can offer on that is I think linearity was again strong in the quarter. We've been, I think, seeing strong linearity for probably four quarters in a row now, measuring month 1 versus month 2. And we did, we've talked before about the price increases. I think the -- and we've talked previously that after discounting, you probably get 55% or something like that -- pardon me, you get 45% afterwards. That was probably a little bit optimistic on my part. I think I was going to get 45% was a little more discounting than maybe I anticipated through that process. And I forgot your third area that you mentioned, I didn't write it down to, I'm sorry. Linearity pricing, something else. Fatima Boolani : That\u2019s good enough. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on the results. Really impressive acceleration. Maybe for my one question, I'll commit to keeping to that. Would like to know where you're seeing -- you've got some nice traction upmarket, it seems. And I'd like to know, how we should think about product as you go upmarket as well as services, the margin involved? And maybe if you can hit on lead times as well. I've heard you've done a pretty good job of keeping lead times much lower than your peers. Is that winning new business upmarket substantially as you go to market? Ken Xie : Definitely, the Fortinet operating team did a very, very good job and also the model we have, working with a manufacturer, working with a -- doing our own ASIC chip directly is also helping. So that's where compared to a lot of other vendors using like third-party on-time supply, which has more difficult to deal with the current supply chain issue. So we do see like with the price increase sometime like as Keith mentioned, there are some more strong requests for some discount and which also we have actually discount, probably to discount more easy to go to a product side than compared to the service side. There's a certain recognition roof, you cannot discount service too much. But also since we have a large strong product, we use security computing region. So that's where for the same function, our performance tend to be 5 times better than competitors. So we do have a market pricing power, which converts customers to move towards our product. At the same time, thinking for the service, we do offer a very broad service, similar better than competitor, but we probably only had about average about half, especially with all the bond orders since. So that's where we do have the pricing power, both on the product and service. That's where the customer doing this time to towards our solution. And also there's a lot of new cases, which our competitors don't have in solution like whether the SD-WAN, vertical to OT, some other part, which also drives quite a lot of additional growth for us. Keith Jensen : Yes, I'd probably offer a little more color behind Ken's comments there, if I could, Brian. I think if you think about the market, let's take the networking equipment, switches and access points. I think the constraint exists all around the board, if you will. I don't know that us versus more traditional networking companies have any more availability in those products than anybody else. And when we look at our backlog, that mix seems to certainly support that. Firewalls, I don't see a lot of customers switching over availability. I offered the comment earlier the script, the prepared remarks that 93% of our existing backlog -- or pardon me, of our backlog is with existing customers. So there's 7% of new logos information in that number, not a very big number. And if I look at new logos in terms of the billings and accounts that we got from the quarter, it was very, very normal in terms of both of the billings and the new logos. I think we're about 5,500 or so on new logo. So I don't really see that, if you will, to the concern. And then if I can pivot back to Panama just quickly, I think your final question was about pull forward and space come up again. But again, I think if we were seeing that in light of these tremendous results I don't think I'd sit here and see a pipeline with such a significant growth is what we're seeing. So I don't really know that I would describe this as any sort of pull forward. Are there customers, large enterprises that came to us in place orders for a longer period deployment schedules. Certainly, and I think some of the comments in the script covered that. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. Maybe a question for both of you, Ken and Keith. I feel like we've talked a little bit about some of the redesign efforts with some of the newer appliance families recently. I was wondering if you could just talk about some of those efforts that Fortinet has done to maybe help some of those supply chain issues. And how helpful those changes could be in terms of fulfilling the demand that you're seeing? Ken Xie : Yes. We start in the redesign effort end of last year without the supply restriction audience. You can see the product we announced today, the 4070-F and even the 600-F, probably would move to like kind of redesign, and then some of them also leverage our new FortiASIC chip. That's really helping customers have a different choice, is so important in some shortage. But also in general, we have a much broader product, both in the -- we call the core product FortiGate core platform and also the platform extension. And so that's gives customers a much better choice. So if silicon products, I'm surely they can easily steer to the next product and -- but still offer much better solution compared to other competitors. So that's where the redesign actually does help in a lot to reduce the supply chain limitation we have and also give customers more choice. So we kind of -- we're keeping that effort and keeping off a very broad product portfolio and which we do feel during the supply chain issue or maybe will last you towards the whole year this year will be definitely helping us and helping customers. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Adam Borg from Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg : Great. And thanks so much for taking the question. Either for Ken or Keith, I'm sorry if I missed it, but in the past few quarters, you've talked about increasing traction in some of your non-traditional verticals. I was just curious, how they performed this go around? And assuming you saw a continued traction there, how are you thinking about making any additional investments to just better capitalize on the opportunities there? Thanks so much. Keith Jensen : Yes. Peter has got me on a word limit on the script, so I apologize that I got taken out because I thought it was worthwhile comment. But in any event, yes, we got more of the same. We've been looking at about a 3-year 5-point shift to that other group. The other group is everything outside the top 5, and we got that again in the current quarter. I think that if you look at it in that other group, the one vertical that continues to stand out, and I don't think it's surprising when you think about it, has been manufacturing. And I think that, that really speaks to the threat environment, ransomware, OT, things of that nature, manufacturing is trying to desperately to break into the top five of our verticals and getting them closer and closer every quarter. Adam Borg : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair and Company. Your line is open. John Weidemoyer : Sorry for that. I was on mute. Yes, this is John Weidemoyer for Jonathan. Thanks for taking the question. If I heard you correctly, when you mentioned use cases, SD-WAN and OT, you mentioned -- did you say that are the other use cases contributed more to growth or just grew faster? Ken Xie : The SD-WAN OT definitely grew faster than the overall company beat there. And also... Keith Jensen : I think the growth rates were faster, but the total contribution was greater than the other use cases that we're trying to parse there. Ken Xie : And also the other prices are strong, also above average. John Weidemoyer : Okay. I just want to clarify that. And I'm hoping that doesn't count as actually my question, but I'll make it easier one for my question. R&D spending going forward, what are your intentions? Do you anticipate any stepped-up investment? Or do you anticipate pretty much typical what you've done in the past? Ken Xie : We kind of feel the real estate is kind of considered some long-term investment, but starting doing that like 10, 15 years ago. And that our rental cost probably less than half compared to competitors similar of our size. So that's where the $100 million we save every year, probably where we're putting both the real estate and also the R&D some other investments. Sorry, I misunderstand as R&D is not real estate. Yes, the real yet R&D, definitely, we will continue to invest in a lot of long-term R&D projects. is from the ASIC, which we made the investment more than 20 years, give us a huge advantage on technology and also enable us pretty much become the only vendor that can meet this convergence of our security networking trend to offer our high-speed security whether inside the company, one solution within the data center to drive tremendous growth and also much better we call the secure computing region. And also the service with a large quantity of product being deployed, we can offer the service much cheaper than a competitor for same service, and that's really drive a huge value add to the customer. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think from a business model view point, I think we kind of like where we're at with the level of investment that we're making in R&D, we can move by one point or two in a given period. And if you peel back a little bit and just look at the R&D team, there's certainly a significant number of engineers and percentages that are working on the ASIC and the chips and so forth. But I would also offer that we have more software engineers than we do hardware engineers.  And I think the reason for that is it goes back to some of the early comments in the text about how important the operating system is to us. The ASIC enables the operating system. They have to work together. But there's a significant investment there. And I think also the other places with some of these platform extensions, excuse me, my term, we're seeing the opportunity there, I think, to make some more discrete investments and maybe mature some of those products along a little bit more. Just not suggesting significant changes in total spending, but just giving some insights in terms of where we see spending. John Weidemoyer : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question is from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Michael Turits : I was interested in the comments that you made about the strength of hardware and not same form factors switch over significantly to software. And obviously, your product numbers were great. So can you talk about -- and I know you've done it before, but both Keith and Ken, talk about the sources of the hardware/appliance security demand and what the source are and really how sustainable that strong growth should be for how long into the future? Keith Jensen : I think you got to be a little bit both. I think the high end FortiGate taking six points of market share is a pretty good indicator. Obviously, the high-end FortiGates are very much targeted at large enterprises. And I think that dovetails very nicely with some of the growth numbers that we gave on G2000 and on the large enterprises as well. I still think that, that's an opportunity for us where we have sometimes not always viewed as being viewed as the incumbent. But I think if you look at our progress over the years in the enterprise sector, particularly in the U.S., which maybe has a little further to go, we're very, very pleased with that. And I would maybe supplement that in terms of enterprise success with the metric that we've talked about from time to time in the past. I think maybe three or four years ago, we talked about in the U.S. of having an account rep ratio of about 65 accounts to 1 rep in the U.S. And that's not really an enterprise model.  And then we made a comment that continuously that we would work to move that number down within the framework with balanced growth and profitability. That number today is about 13 or 14 accounts per rep. So I don't think it's a coincidence that you're seeing the success in the large enterprise with the large appliances given the level of investment that we've been able to make in that segment of the market. Ken Xie : Also from our beginning, we more look at how to secure the whole infrastructure, especially for the area. Like in the past, whether in the high-speed environment or kind of a branch or remote access is very, very difficult to involve in security because of speed requirement because all these kind of difficult to manage. So that's what we see with our own ASIC and the long-term investments on ASIC, which will enable us to really get in this new area, the traditional network security cannot solve. So that's where we see huge growth in this area. And at the same time, we do keep in promoting we call the convergence and network security. So that's where we competing power from ASIC and also the new FortiOS keeping upgrade every year. So we do see more and more security case and more security being deployed in the whole infrastructure just beyond the traditional network security deployment. Operator : And our next question is from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hamza Fodderwala : Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. And thanks for the great detail earlier in the call. Keith, maybe one for you. Just you attributed the gap in the product and the services growth to customers, at least a slight uptick in early ordering versus last quarter, it sounds like, I think that you mentioned about 60% of the hardware backlog that you had in Q4 was billed in Q1. So in terms of your Q2 billings guide, how do you think about that backlog to billings conversion, particularly in a perhaps less certain macro environment and perhaps a little bit more than uptick in early ordering? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think as it relates to how we think about what the backlog might mean, and we just remind people, we made the switch, I think, in the middle of the fourth quarter, asked our sales team to run the business on bookings and then we\u2019ll convert it to billings here, which means working very, very close with our manufacturing team and our operations team. In terms of what they're seeing in terms of availability and what levers they have to pull. And with that in mind, I think the key now, I spend a lot more time with operations as part of the forecasting guidance process than I do with the sales team. And where we've kind of sold out on that is that I get a weekly update from the sales team in terms of what their expectations of backlog are going to be, and we've been doing that every week this year, and I think some of last year.  And they've shown to be fairly darn accurate. I think what you see right now in the first quarter was very high bookings, which drag along some backlog. But I think that the operations team has done a very good job. One thing that we do now use is this concept of what -- how much was net backlog increased as a percentage of bookings. And that number has hovered right around 8.5% to 9% in the fourth quarter in the first quarter. And so when we want to sanity check, what we're hearing from the operations team, we now have a metric that we didn't have six months ago in terms of a little bit of history, and we apply that metric to it, say, does that seem reasonable for all their hard work when you get done, does it seem like it's a reasonable number, and we think it has been. Operator : And our next question is from Adam Tindall from Morgan -- at Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. Keith, I just wanted to ask a question to try to get to the heart of real-time demand and certainly appreciate all the disclosures you've been giving. I'm looking at bookings, obviously, it's been strong on a year-over-year basis, but from Q4 to Q1 sequentially, it was kind of the same level of increases last year. And if I heard you correctly, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your guidance for Q2 bookings implied maybe down a little bit sequentially. And I'm wondering if that's starting to signal that we're plateauing on incremental growth in demand and returning to a new or a more normal orders cadence? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the -- I probably want to check the numbers. I'm looking at a bookings number in the first quarter, it was about $12.75 and a bookings number in the second quarter that I think we talked about thinking at the midpoint, $13.55. So I don't know that I'm seeing a deceleration as that you may be concerned about. Adam Tindle : Okay. I misheard you on the Q2 guidance. I was just looking at from Q4 to Q1. And maybe another one to tackle while we're at it. You talked about the seasonality shift last quarter, two to three points to the back half of the year. Looks like that might be a little bit more smooth based on the updated Q2 guidance and full year guidance. Maybe just what changed on that expectations for a back half versus now? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think what we ended up on the full year number. Through all the analysis that we do, I think the raise for the full year is roughly the beat that we had in the first quarter plus the raise that we had in the second quarter. And we sanity check that we're looking at our pipeline growth or sales capacity, what we think the price increases are going to deliver some more metrics around the backlog and want to make sure that we getting too far ahead of ourselves and over our skis. And I think that's a pretty good number to be at right now in the current environment. There remains a lot of uncertainty, as you know, out there and getting overly bullish on Q3 and Q4 right now. I think we'd like to see how this plays out a little bit more. Adam Tindle : Understood. I'm looking forward to the Analyst Day, I'm sure Peter will plug it. Peter Salkowski : On that note, next question, please. Operator : And our next question is from Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. And congrats on the nice quarter. I just want to ask about your pipeline because this is the second quarter in a row that you've talked about pipeline strength. At the end of Q4, I think you said you had a strong pipeline entering 2022, and now you're saying you have an accelerating or you're seeing accelerating pipeline growth. I'm just wondering if you could put a finer point on that accelerating growth comment and where you\u2019re seeing that growth accelerating. Thanks. Keith Jensen : I don't -- I think it's pervasive. And I -- we look at the three different sources of pipeline, the way we talk about the channel, the marketing team and the direct sales force. I think we're pleased with the contribution from all three of them, no doubt about that. We've talked for an extended period of time a few years about the importance of the channel and investments that we make and partnering with them and working together on that. And I think that the channel is holding up their side of the bargain as well.  I think the marketing team, give them a ton of credit. I love the Fortinet championship event and the continued success for it and how they've now leveraged that in other geographies as well. And the direct sales team continues to perform at a very high level and you're seeing the numbers. And obviously, to the extent that you were able to continue to add headcount, like the metric I gave earlier, more people are going to drive more pipeline. So I don't know that I would isolate it to any one of those three areas of where it's coming from or even geographically. I mean it's been strong throughout. Ken, I don't know Ken Xie : Yes. I agree. Both additional investment we made in the marketing sales, and also restructure the team make it more efficient and drive quite a lot of additional pipeline for us. Andrew Nowinski : Okay guys. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Benjamin Bollin : Thanks. I appreciate for taking the question. I was hoping you could address a little bit about how you view service opportunities longer term. You suggested you're expecting some catch-up or acceleration on services through back half based on backlog lead times procurement, but interested in how you think the elevated level of appliance placements this year could influence demand for services even beyond 2022. Ken Xie : Yes, it's a great question. We do see the service will be -- drive additional growth, additional margin for us going forward, especially the new FortiOS 7.2, we offer quite a lot of new service. And a lot of service today, we don't charge customers. And also, on average, our service cost is about half of our own competitors. So there's a lot of room we can grow the service and improving the margin there.  So that will be -- and also with the other we call the platform extension product, which is upsell, cross-sell, which will also kind of drive quite a lot of additional service on the total solution there. So that's where we do believe the service is -- I think in Q1, you see the product revenue growth so strong. And -- but on the other side, the short-term service revenue, also very strong. That's probably be starting to come in later this year. And at the same time, the additional server will be launched with FortiOS 7.2 like the Fortitrust on the CTA, on identity. There's some other service, the CASB, some other we have, we believe will be additional revenue, additional sales, additional margin for us. Keith Jensen : Ben, it's Keith. And just from a modeling point of view, keep in mind that those price increases that we had in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, that we get that lift in product revenue immediately. It takes a little bit longer to see it in the services line because of how the timing of rev rec. Then I think you're going to start to see between new sales and renewals, the new price points that have been created for the services will start to have an impact, and that's part of the acceleration that we talked about. Benjamin Bollin : Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question is from Rob Amen from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is Justin on for Rob. I just wanted to follow up on the OT topic. You guys have quantified the success in selling into this use case for a couple of quarters now. I'm just curious how you view the OT as a driver into 2022 and beyond, especially when you consider the explicit federal government guidance and broader spending intentions around protecting critical infrastructure? Ken Xie : Yes. The OT definitely sees a bigger market going forward, probably bigger than the SD-WAN, which we see pretty strong growth and also -- so that's where the total OTs catching up. I think in the last point -- OT maybe close to 10% of the business and -- but the growth is very, very strong. So that's where we do see a lot of potential, and we also invest a lot in this area to meet the demand. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks. Operator :  Our next question is from Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is open. Gray Powell : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on the really strong results. So yes, I guess I was just hoping to drill in on the SD-WAN side. How should we think about the growth of your SD-WAN business this year with just within the context of guidance or maybe relative to the overall company growth -- and then how do you feel about the competitive environment in that category and just your ability to maintain growth at or above market rates the next few years? Ken Xie : First, I do because SD-WAN will continue to grow like 30%, 40% year-over-year in the probably the next 5 years and because it's a technology definitely can read the travel based on application, all these things is a wire benefit for the consumer for the customer. So for us, we offer the only security combined with SD-WAN and also leverage on ASIC to have a huge performance advantage that give us more function. So that's where we -- so far, the SD-WAN we sell as a part of the platform, the FortiGate platform where we don't even try the service, but that's also additional compared to our other vendors, they do have some kind of service charges regular SD-WAN.  So we do see -- we have a huge advantage, both on the function on the cost and the SD-WAN and will continue keeping gaining market share. We do feel we'll be keeping growing above the market growth. But also we feel this is the product we call convergence of our security and networking together. So SD-WAN is more address on one side, but also will helping drive the land side inside the company, the segmentation is a data center and eventually make the whole infrastructure very secure for the customer. Gray Powell : Understood. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Irvin Liu from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Irvin Liu : Hi, thanks for the question. So I was surprised to hear that 93% of backlog is from your existing customers. But I was wondering if you can help us parse through some of that strength within your existing customers. How much of this is addressing the broader growth of their IT workloads and more attack surfaces versus a like-for-like growth in -- or versus, let's just say, installed base refresh? Or is this more of you displacing other vendors within your current customer base? Keith Jensen : Yes. I can't really quantify it. I just haven't looked at it that way. It's a good question, a good approach. If I were to make informed judgments, if you will, I think that expansion is by far the largest opportunity for us. It's just the nature of the business. And I think the refresh and the competitive placements are probably fairly close to each other, I would imagine, for the remainder. There is refresh for us is we have a very long product suite. So we Ken will always have a new product. You saw the three new products come out be announced today. So there's always some sort of refresh activity in our own product that's going on there. But we -- I would also note that we are consistently getting more at bats, if you will, more opportunities with sales, more competitive displacement. So I would imagine just my gut is, again, refreshing competitive displacements are probably in a similar neighborhood, but expansion is the biggest. Ken Xie : Also, we have the biggest customer installation base in the industry. So we have probably call to 40% of total deployed in the industry, probably more than the number 2, number 3, number 4 add together. So that give us a quite a broad customer base. And I think it's close to 600,000 customers, some of them are only using Fortinet solution in part of infrastructure. So now we do see the benefit expand to the additional infrastructure and also what we call fabric of mesh network, we manage it together. So we do see a lot of expansion beyond the initial deployment. Irvin Liu : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : And our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz : Hey, thank you for taking the question. Keith, just to follow up on early ordering last quarter, you had estimated that low single digits of your Q4 business came from product ordered in advance. How would you size this for the Q1? And then just a clarification, if I may. Because obviously, the backlog went up very impressively. Are switches and access points still about two-thirds of your backlog today? Thank you. Keith Jensen : I think the backlog is being closer to 50-50 between networking equipment or I guess, I should call it platform extension because it's in there and the firewalls or the core platform. I think it's kind of balanced out. I do think it's low-end FortiGates that are still dominating in the Fortinet space, if you will. I don't remember quantifying early ordering as a percentage, if you will. It's certainly something we've talked about here internally is our way of measuring that. And I think that's why we kind of provide -- Peter is going to give me some coaching here. Peter Salkowski : Well, I think what we said in the fourth quarter last year was that we had -- we knew of some transactions, a couple of deals that we knew were going to be ordered -- that be delivered into 2022 that were ordered part of backlog and we're in the backlog in 2021 at the end of the year. That was a few -- a couple of other million dollar deals that we were doing, too. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the constraints, if you will, on that is more around when is the supply going to be available because it's in backlog, we can deliver as soon as the supply arrives. But that's just more a function of how we're working with our suppliers or anything else. Gregg Moskowitz : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions on queue. Do you have any closing remarks? Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Laurie. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As a reminder and a plug, Fortinet will be hosting an Analyst Day on Tuesday, May 10, next week. A link to register for the webcast can be found on the Events and Presentations page of the company's Investor Relations website. If you register now, it's a little quicker next Tuesday. You can also register day of. But again, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate the interest in Fortinet. Everybody, have a great day. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, after the speakers\u2019 presentation, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Peter Salkowski. Please go ahead. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Hope. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fortinet. I\u2019m pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Speakers on today\u2019s call are Ken Xie, Fortinet\u2019s Founder, Chairman and CEO; and Keith Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will begin our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial operating results for the second quarter before providing guidance for the third quarter, updating the full year. We\u2019ll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow for others to participate. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that on today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics that we mine in today\u2019s call are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in the earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today\u2019s remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Ken and Keith\u2019s prepared remarks today for the earnings call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following today\u2019s call. Lastly, all references are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks Peter. Thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our outstanding second quarter 2022 results. Total billings increased 36%; the fifth consecutive quarter of at least 35% year-over-year billings growth. Revenue grew 29% driven by 34% product revenue growth. SD-WAN and OT bookings grew over 60% and 75%, which together accounted for 25% of total second quarter bookings. Our better-than-expected performance demonstrates the strong demand for our cybersecurity innovation. Fortinet is at the forefront of networking and security convergence, enabling our customers to reduce complexity, while securing and connecting hybrid and remote users to advanced security with superior performance. Today we announced the FortiGate 4800F, our latest innovation in converged Network Security. The 4800F is the world\u2019s fastest compact firewall for hyperscale data centers and 5G networks. Powered by Fortinet\u2019s NP7 SPU, the 4800F delivers Security Compute Ratings of on average 5-10 times better performance than competitive solutions, across the six most common and important functions. A leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure, Fortinet continues to take market share for Secure SD-WAN. Our integrated secure SDWAN solution, powered by Fortinet\u2019s SPU SOC4, delivers huge performance, security and efficiencies over traditional offerings. In addition to convergence, consolidation of vendors and product functionality is another major trend, particularly in Network Security. In a recent CISO survey, Gartner found the percentage of companies surveyed who want fewer security providers increased to 75% from only 29% in 2020. With over 30 products lines built mostly by our in-house strong engineering and development innovation, Fortinet is benefiting from this consolidation with our Security Fabric MESH offering. The Fortinet Security MESH platform delivers unparalleled protection with broad, integrated and automated protection across multiple edges, from endpoint, to data center, and hybrid cloud environments. These two major trends, convergence and consolidation, position Fortinet well for long-term growth. Before turning the call over to Keith, I\u2019d like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work, that are contributing to Fortinet\u2019s strong growth. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let\u2019s start the more detailed quarterly discussion. Second quarter results were solid and broad-based across geographies, customer sizes, industries, and use cases, driving market share gains and demonstrating the strong support from our three key growth drivers : first, an elevated threat environment; second, the convergence of security and networking; and third, the consolidation of security products across our platform offerings. Total revenue of $1.03 billion was up 29%, passing the $1 billion milestone in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. Total product revenue growth was up 34%. Core Platform and Platform Extension product revenue growth was up 35% and 33%, respectively. We continued to see robust product revenue growth from a wide range of security use cases, including Secure SD-WAN and Operational Technology, or OT. Total service revenue growth increased sequentially to 25%, resulting in service revenue of $629 million. Support and related service revenue was up 26% to $289 million, while security subscriptions service revenue was up 25%, or 2 points sequentially, to $340 million. Service billings, defined as total billings minus product revenue, were up 36%. The year-over-year growth rate for short-term deferred revenue has increased for six quarters in a row from just under 21% in Q4 of 2020 to just over 31% in Q2 of 2022, the highest short-term deferred revenue growth rate in over six years. The accelerating growth rates for service billings and short-term deferred revenue reflect the earlier pricing actions that quickly appeared in product revenue and that are now beginning to appear in service revenue. The pricing benefit more than offset various service revenue headwinds, including suspending services in Russia, an increase in the average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activates a security service contract, and the impact of contract manufacturers delaying deliveries to later in the quarter, which limits our service revenue on new sales recognized in the quarter. With growth and pricing benefits more than offsetting these headwinds, we expect service revenue growth will continue to accelerate through 2022 and into next year. As summarized on slide 6, total revenue in the Americas increased 23%, EMEA revenue increased 28%, and APAC posted revenue growth of 42%. Despite macro conditions that may be more readily impacting other industries, our pipeline growth remains strong. In particular, EMEA\u2019s pipeline growth indicates continued strength in our European business. Moving to a summary of our success with large enterprises. Large enterprises continue to favor Fortinet\u2019s leading cost for performance advantage and are increasingly more appreciative of our integrated platform. The platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities and consolidate multiple point products. Our success with large enterprise customers includes : global 2000 bookings growth of over 65% year-over-year and on a rolling four quarter basis; large enterprise bookings growth of over 55% year-over-year and on a rolling 4 quarter basis; and the number of deals over $1 million increased over 50% to 122 deals and the total billings value of these transactions doubled. Secure SD-WAN bookings grew over 60%, reflecting the convergence of networking and security as well as a strong ROI for our customers. OT bookings were up over 75%, reflecting the continued response to the elevated threat environment. Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.3 billion were up 36%, as Ken pointed, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. I\u2019ll pause here to offer thoughts on product refresh cycles and their impact on our financial results. Specifically, we do not believe new product releases drive a near term spike in our top-line growth; rather, we believe the continual nature of our product releases drives long-term growth. For example, each new ASIC is included in a series of products released over several years. Our most recent ASIC chip, the NP7 Security Processing Unit, was introduced in Q1 of 2020. Including the 4800F announced today, we have released 9 high-end Core Platform products with the NP7 chip. Over the next several quarters we will release several additional midrange and high-end products with the NP7. Lastly, I would note that since the start of 2019, we have released over 23 new FortiGate models. While some of our competitors with much shorter product SKU lists may have shown clear signs of product refresh cycles, our strong long-term performance illustrates an extended series of overlapping product maturity curves. Core Platform billings were up 32% and accounted for 69% of total billings. As shown on slide 7, mid-range FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the mix shifting 5 points in their favor driven by demand as well as supply availability. Platform Extension billings were up 44% and accounted for 31% of total billings, a mix shift of over one 1.5 points. Average contract term was up one month year-over-year at 29 months, driven by the strength from large enterprise customers and the 50% plus increase in the number of deals greater than $1 million. Worldwide government billings grabbed the largest share of the mix at 15% and were up 45%. The top five verticals accounted for 60% of total billings. Moving back to the income statement. Total gross margin of 76.5% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 125 basis points, even as component, labor and freight costs increased, and the year-over-year revenue mix shifted 2 points to product revenue from higher margin service revenue. Product gross margin of 61.9% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and 450 basis points sequentially as pricing actions, product mix, and lower discounting offset higher component and other costs. Service gross margin of 85.9% was down 100 basis points due to increased costs associated with the expansion of our data center footprint as well as labor cost and other costs; partially offset by benefits from FX and some of the earlier pricing actions. Operating margin of 24.8% exceeded the midpoint of the guidance range by approximately 200 basis points. The year-over-year comparison saw the FX benefit offset by lower gross margins, increased travel and marketing costs and other costs. Headcount increased 27% to 11,508. Looking to the statement of cash flows summarized on slides 8 and 9. Free cash flow was $284 million and was impacted by increases in DSO and cash taxes. DSO increased 14 days year-over-year and 5 days sequentially to 80 days due to the change in billing linearity driven by the timing of inventory deliveries from contract manufacturers. New R&D capitalization rules increased second quarter cash taxes by $85 million to $110 million. Second half cash taxes of approximately $135 million are expected to be more evenly spread across the third and fourth quarters. For the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow margin, which excludes real estate spending, was 34%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million, including $21 million for real estate investments. We repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $800 million, bringing the total year-to-date shares repurchased to 25.8 million for a total cost of $1.5 billion. The Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization is now $1.03 billion. Inventory turns of 3.1 times were up a half turn year-over-year and down a half turn sequentially. Moving to bookings and backlog. As a reminder, backlog is excluded from the current quarter billings and revenue. Nonetheless, it is expected to provide increased visibility and a top-line tailwind in future quarters. Bookings were up 42% to $1.4 billion. Total backlog of $350 million is up $72 million sequentially and reflects very strong demand. Of the total backlog, networking equipment accounted for about 50%, while FortiGates accounted for 40%. We believe our backlog is very strong and sticky. Existing customers account for over 95% of total backlog and no single end customer accounts for more than low single digits as a percentage of backlog. There are four deals in backlog, all from previously existing customers, with a remaining balance of over $2 million that together account for 6% of total backlog. Just 4% of ending Q1 backlog was canceled in Q2 and about half of the deals in backlog have been partially fulfilled suggesting that double ordering is not a significant contributor to backlog. Consistent with the first quarter, we shipped approximately 60% of the prior quarter\u2019s backlog in the current quarter, as our operation and R&D teams did an excellent job navigating the tough supply chain environment. Nonetheless, we still expect supply chain constraints to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year. We are continuing to address the supply chain challenges in a number of ways, including by increasing inventory purchase commitments, redesigning products, qualifying additional suppliers, and certain pricing actions. We believe that even with these actions, demand will continue to outstrip supply. As a result, we expect backlog to continue to increase in 2022; and while the situation is very dynamic, we believe we will have access to sufficient inventory to meet our guidance. As we balance our pricing actions with the opportunity for continued market share gains, we have passed along most, but not all cost increases. As such, we expect ongoing gross margin volatility from these increases as well as shifts in our product mix related to inventory availability. Before reviewing our guidance, let\u2019s offer a few Fortinet specific observations in areas you may have heard discussed elsewhere. In Q2, we noted certain larger transactions with increased or elongated negotiating cycles. Also, linearity pushed to later in the quarter, and later in the last month of the quarter, mainly due to supply constraints and the deliveries. Lastly, close rates were strong and, importantly, the aggregate value of deals that pushed out were within our historical norms. Now, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the third quarter as summarized on slide 10, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the third quarter, we anticipate our solid third quarter pipeline growth across deal types, sizes and geographies to support the following : Bookings in the range of $1,455 million to $1,485 million, which at the midpoint represents bookings growth of 36%; billings in the range of $1,385 million to $1,415 million, which represents growth of 32%; revenue in the range of $1,105 million to $1,135 million, which represents growth of 29%; non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 to $0.28, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and 820 million; we estimate third quarter capital expenditures to be between $105 million and $115 million; we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. For the full year, we anticipate backlog that could approach or possibly exceed $500 million that will be offset by robust industry growth, pipeline strength, and market share gains fueling our growth and support the following : Billings in the range of $5,560 million to $5,640 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 34%; revenue in the range of $4,350 million to $4,400 million, which represents growth of 31%; total service revenue in the range of $2,620 million to $2,670 million, which represents growth of 27% and implies full-year product revenue growth of 38%; we expect non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.06, which assumes a share count of between 810 million and 820 million; we estimate full year capital expenditures to be between $300 million and $330 million; we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%; we expect cash taxes for the year to be $265 million, as I mentioned earlier, cash taxes paid are higher in 2022 due to the new R&D capitalization rules in the U.S. Along with Ken, I would like to thank our partners, customers, suppliers, and all members of the Fortinet team for all of their hard work, execution and success. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. With that, Hope, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with GS. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Congrats to team on a nice set of results for the quarter. I was wondering if maybe -- and Keith, I certainly appreciate the commentary and the granularity with the full year revenue guide. Can we maybe unpack some of the commentary on the services side and the lower, I guess, services revenue guide for the year? Maybe help us understand what\u2019s going on there. And maybe pair that with your comments on delays in activations and how much insight you might have there that gets folks comfortable that there isn\u2019t pull-forward? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. I don\u2019t think -- Brian, I don\u2019t think pull forward really applies to the service revenue line, but maybe -- it\u2019s actually a couple of questions at once. I think the answer to your question about service revenue, I think the biggest change from where we started the year is really about Russia. If you think about Russia, we talked at the very beginning, it\u2019s about 1.5% of our total revenue. And it applies to the service revenue line as well. Earlier in the year, we stopped recognizing revenue on existing contracts for services that provide in Russia in conjunction with our suspending of services. At that time, we did not anticipate it would be a full year event, but we are now. And if you kind of think through that 1.5% of service revenues in Russia, so we really backed out now for the full year about $25 million of revenue related to Russia. That\u2019s the largest change there. I think the delay in registrations from when contracts are sold, when they\u2019re actually registered by customers, I think we pretty much got out of the quarter what we expected on that. That seems to be something in the current environment with inventory constraints that we\u2019re going to continue to see. I think the linearity part of it is a little bit new in that because the shipments occurred later in the quarter, there really wasn\u2019t the opportunity to get the service revenue from those Q2 shipments that we would normally get. And so, I think those are really the parts to put together there. On the other side, I would probably point to, again, the short-term deferred revenue billings and the number that we\u2019re putting up here and the growth that you\u2019re seeing with that number as well as service billings itself. And I think the last comment on this, and we haven\u2019t talked about it before, is that the service contracts are really a use it or lose it contract, meaning it\u2019s not that they have the ability to cancel, they just have the ability to postpone the registration for a period of time, whether -- depending upon the geography, whether that\u2019s 90 days or one year or what have you. So, eventually, it comes to revenue, but the timing has been pushed out to that aspect. Operator : Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citibank. Fatima Boolani : Hey. Keith, this one\u2019s for you. Just with respect to some of the backlog detail and commentary that you shared, I want to hone in on the cancellation rates that you quantified for us. I believe you said it was about 4%. Can you give us a sense of what are some of the reasons behind the cancellation? And what gives you confidence that that 4% isn\u2019t going to stretch or escalate into maybe mid to high single digits? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think I would point to some of the factors that we\u2019ve talked about before. I think that last quarter, we talked about the cancellation rate being 5%, I think we\u2019re seeing it now 4%. I think it\u2019s unlikely that existing customers, particularly those that have received partial shipments are going to cancel. Also, I don\u2019t want to -- that it\u2019s na\u00efve that as backlog gets older, and it\u2019s also why we provide that 60% of shipments from prior backlog number for The Street to try and understand it. But if that number starts to tick up, obviously, there\u2019s more risk in it. I think it\u2019s important to understand the guidance that we provide really isn\u2019t reflecting in any sort of shift in the backlog that we\u2019re going to ship a lot of things from backlog. So, I think we\u2019re fairly prudent in that regard, and I think we\u2019re also comfortable with described as the stickiness of the backlog number. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Adam Borg : Maybe just on the macro. You talked a little bit about the demand environment and highlighted some delayed deals and elongated linearity. Can you maybe go a little bit deeper here and talk about what these customer conversations look like? Are these tied to any particular verticals or geographies? You talked a little bit about large enterprise or larger deals. I\u2019d love to hear about the midsize to smaller deals, too. Thanks. Ken Xie : It\u2019s Ken. So, we do see a lot of customers, especially enterprise, they\u2019re starting to design some new infrastructure to support and work from anywhere and also expand security beyond the traditional network security and to whether like internal segmentation to prevent nowadays ransomware attack or go to work from home and at the same time, have multiple security products, need to be automated together. So we call the consolidation, both on the product side, on the vendor side. I see this kind of trend will be last for the next few years, will be pretty long-term change. And at the same time, Keith also mentioned elevated security environment also other drive. So, that\u2019s where we see the trend we\u2019re keeping going for the next few years. If you look at the billing number compared to two years ago, I mentioned in my script is -- we have over 35% of billing increase in the last five quarters compared to two years ago, Q1 2020 is only about 14%. So, we do see the change in acceleration and also the convergence consolidation going on in the whole space right now will be pretty much the amount of growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket Kalia : Keith, maybe for you. I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about bookings. Can you just talk about how bookings did versus your expectation this quarter? I think the guide coming into Q2 was for about 40% growth. We came in at 42%, clearly better, but a bigger delta on the billings versus the guide. And so, can you just talk about how to read into that, if there\u2019s anything to consider there with just those two kind of in relation to each other? Keith Jensen : Yes. I don\u2019t -- I think, obviously, 42% bookings. I think we\u2019ve been over 40% now for 3 quarters, maybe 4 quarters in the bookings line, we feel really, really good about it. I think the one thing that we\u2019re looking at internally, it\u2019s just that the interplay between bookings, backlog and billings and trying to really get a sense of the direction of the business. And the example I kind of gave is we had a very good quarter on the midrange of the product. But some of that was due to availability. Demand was very strong, but it was also because we had the midrange product available. We didn\u2019t have as much product available in the low end. Now, as we shifted to this third quarter, I think we\u2019re probably going to see the low end availability improved fairly dramatically. And so, when you\u2019re looking at billings information that we have historically disclosed and trying to gauge the direction of the business, it gets a little bit distorted now just in terms of what\u2019s available. And I think of the total when you look at bookings and backlog, there\u2019s some of that as well in terms of the characterization of what the booking is versus the characterization of what\u2019s available to ship and what comes in the billings line. Ken Xie : Also compared to one year ago, maybe a tough comparison because we\u2019re started to see the acceleration about five quarters ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Keith, you talked in the prepared remarks about still expecting supply challenges for the rest of the year and to offset you\u2019re thinking increased purchase commitments, qualifying additional suppliers and pricing actions. I wanted to zoom in on that last point on pricing actions to see if you would maybe put a finer point on timing and magnitude for expected pricing actions? And secondly, you sounded positive on elasticity and confident on the elasticity moving forward. But just curious what underpins that confidence, especially in international markets with dollar strengthening in local currencies and fixed budgets, et cetera? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. Great question. And I\u2019ll take the last one first because I think it\u2019s probably very important, and I probably forgot the first one already. So one of the things that we do is we track very religiously in our CRM tool when a customer -- if we lose a deal, we want to know why, right? Is it because we could not overcome the incumbency, is it because the channel partner may have had a bias, if you will, to one of our competitors, a feature issue, a functionality issue or something like that, but also very specifically, do we lose on price. And we\u2019ve been tracking that now for over a year. And that percentage, which is low -- lower than the other ones that I just gave in to you, has been extremely consistent. And so with that very consistent loss percentage, if you will, I translate that into price elasticity, which tells me that the question is always how far can you push the envelope. We know we come into the conversation with a significant price and performance advantage, The Street sometimes -- or channels just may say 30% or 40%. We have known that from the beginning of this phase of the economic cycle. And the question has become how far can we push that. But again, keep in mind, our goal is really to try over a longer period of time just match the cost increases and maintain a consistent margin. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re really trying to take down more margin. Now you will get volatility quarter-to-quarter because of the mix and things like that. So, a long-winded way to say, I think I really hang my head on what I\u2019m seeing and we\u2019re tracking on the CRM data about reasons that we lose deals and reasons that we win deals. Ken Xie : Yes. And also a few other comments about pricing. Our policy tends to be just by the price by small step, but also kind of more open, like we do have a new price book basically released every quarter. Also, the other thing is really like the product we released today, on average for the same function, for the same price range, our product has a performance factor 10 times better than competitors. Like Keith mentioned, on the CRM on the tracking, we don\u2019t see any big loss on kind of changing or even -- if you do not -- actually improved because we still have a huge price advantage compared to competitors. The other thing also may be mentioned to the service. I think one we may try to improve a little bit going forward is really even in the last few quarters, we increased some of the price more on the new product release, but we are not changing the price for the expired product. Basically, the product is still added to the service like 5, 6 -- right? So, that\u2019s one thing we made because the labor cost on the service and supporting, so we may have to increase the price of the outdated product no longer shipping because all the service or the renew still tied to the old product, which is no longer shipping but is the customer still buying the renewal, buying the service based on the old product. So, that\u2019s probably -- we can also help in the improving the service and also helping the margin and compensate our additional costs, especially on the labor. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Michael Turits : So, Keith, two questions. First, maybe it seems obvious in some ways, but do you feel like -- and this is the first time that you\u2019ve talked about this linearity issue as well as the extension of the negotiation cycle. So, do you simply tie it to macro being worse right now, or do you have any other insights to it? And then, I just wanted to make sure that in your mind, second question, you really think that it\u2019s really primarily services as a result of those things, this shortfall in the year and you\u2019re happy with product? Keith Jensen : Yes. So, I think the -- well, putting aside the -- Mike, you broke the rule and you asked two questions and Peter said only one and a follow-up. Michael Turits : Sorry about that... Keith Jensen : I think what we\u2019re seeing in linearity, unlike a \u201cnormal world\u201d where you can kind of look at linearity and DSO and you can get a sense for whether or not a company is pushing to close deals at the end of the quarter and maybe it\u2019s a more challenging quarter. Because of the timing of when the finish -- when the inventory is delivered from the contract manufacturers, we see a shift in that linearity of when we receive inventory from our contract manufacturers. That shift then it translates into when we can turn around QA, et cetera, and ship it out to our customers and sell it. So, there\u2019s a different aspect of linear that\u2019s come into play here now. So, service contracts that maybe would have been sold in the first month of the quarter, actually got sold in the third month of the quarter. So, we lose service revenue from that. And you see that appearing in the DSO and you see it appearing in the free cash flow. On the negotiating side of it, I think what we saw, and I don\u2019t know if this is common to others -- what we saw was probably the first two weeks of June and maybe there was more conversation around recession and concerns there, if you will, a bit of a pause in terms of deal closure rates for those first 10 days of June and then a reacceleration as we got through the end of June. We did notice or I did notice during that time frame maybe additional parties were being introduced to either as an approver or a negotiator, if you will, on some of the larger deals just to make sure on the customer side that they were making the right decision. And I think that\u2019s why I went on to say in the prepared remarks, not only did we notice this shift, but the close rates, which were important actually were up just a tad in the quarter. So, I think there was just for whatever reason, there was a slight pause there for a couple of weeks in June and everybody came back and got the deals done by -- on the customer side and our side at that last week in June. Ken Xie : The other reason for a little bit longer closing time really the bigger deal grow faster. So, like I mentioned, the deal over $1 million grew over 50% year-over-year. So, that\u2019s the bigger deals also tend to be -- take a little bit longer time to close. And also, we see more like a deal involving multiple products, not just the FortiGate, but also we call the non-FortiGate, call the platform retention, which also take a little bit long time to test -- evaluate to close. On the supply chain, since really compared to before the pandemic, we probably ship majority -- most of the products by sea. Now we\u2019re pretty much shipping every product by air. That\u2019s where the timing of the supply shipping the product to us is pretty critical automatically. And so last quarter, we did experience a lot of product being shipped in end of the quarter from suppliers to us, that drives the linearity. Even we have the booking -- but we are the way -- like a few weeks or even a couple of months before the product was shipped to the customer more towards the quarter end because the supply shipping goes pretty much in the end of the quarter. So, we do see long term, this will be changing, improving. We\u2019ll keep increasing some of the product inventory and improving the product turn and also balance among not just shipping everything by air, but some by air, some by ocean. Operator : Our next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : Good segue from Michael\u2019s question. Keith, I want to try to understand, you talked about a few different things impacting the year guide. To put context around it, your revenue guide for \u201822 isn\u2019t changing, which I think is viewed as a disappointment to investors. Now underneath that, services revenues is getting compressed a little bit. And so, as you think about why the revenue estimates are going higher for the year, is there a change in, a, the demand level, whether it\u2019s the elongation because you said, in fact, there was two weeks, sort of weak at the end of June, but it sounds like during the last -- through the 3rd of August, things have normalized, or is it b, supply chain issues that are causing you to not raise your revenue guidance even as you\u2019re raising billings modestly? I\u2019m just trying to understand what are the forces that are impacting the lack of raise, if you will? Is it the demand side and/or is it the supply side? Keith Jensen : Yes. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s necessarily either demand or supply. I would start the conversation off by saying I think the pipeline growth is extremely strong. We feel very, very good about that. I do think there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty as we look out beyond the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of directions the economies may go, what inflation may do and a little bit of supply chain. I don\u2019t think -- we did, as you point out, cover the shortfall, if you will, in the service revenue -- economies may go, what inflation may do and a little bit of supply chain. I don\u2019t think -- we did, as you point out, cover the shortfall, if you will, in the service revenue, in the product revenue. So I think that\u2019s a fairly good size of us being bullish and feeling very, very good about our competitive advantage. And I think that the other aspect we talked about is just the large deals and how we\u2019re seeing the success in the enterprise and getting a little more dependent on large deals than we have in prior years and some of the close rates around those. I think that while we\u2019re bullish, we think we have competitive advantages. I don\u2019t know as we get to the fourth quarter, if this is really a good time to think about that in a very, very aggressive fashion. Keith Bachman : Okay. So, as I just clarify, so it sounds like you want to be a little bit conservative or you don\u2019t want to get ahead of yourself on particularly the Q4 guide, so lead numbers where they are on revenues, in particular? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair description. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Cowen. Shaul Eyal : Maybe segueing from the prior question from revenue maybe to OpEx. So, your hiring plans appear to remain largely on track. What\u2019s the current thinking on second half? Is it becoming a little easier in recent months, given some layoffs at some private competitors? Ken Xie : We want to maintain healthy margins and then also keeping growth and gaining market, agreed hiring is relatively a little bit easier compared to like a few quarters ago, especially in the cybersecurity space. So for us, we feel we have a good pace on hiring, especially we still -- we\u2019re keeping gaining market share. And the margin -- and it\u2019s a healthy margin, basically, both on the gross margin and also on the operating margin side. So, we feel we have pretty solid plan and balance among the growth and margin. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think Ken\u2019s spot on with that. I would probably offer a couple of things to support. One is you continue to hear us talk about our inventory commitments looking out now 6 quarters or more. I think the read through that is that we still feel fairly bullish about it. And the other aspect of it. And the other aspect of it and Ken made reference to it is we talk about 25% operating margins in different ways over the years as being an average or target, what have you. And obviously, to -- in this environment to -- with high inflation, to come in successfully and still be providing guidance for the full year of 25% to 26%, while growing the top line aggressively while taking market share, I think we feel very good about how the sales team, the engineering team, the operation teams and support teams, et cetera, are all working together and driving the growth of the Company and the execution. Operator : The next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Hamza Fodderwala : Maybe a question for both, Ken and Keith. Ken, just given the general pressure on budgets in the macro environment, are you seeing a little bit more impetus to -- from customers to want to consolidate to a converged security networking platform like Fortinet? And then for Keith, if you\u2019re seeing any weakness, let\u2019s say, elongating, negotiating cycles and whatnot? Is it more weighted towards the core platform FortiGate side or the platform extension side, which is in access points? Ken Xie : It\u2019s a very good question. Definitely, we see the convergence among the network and security. Also the pandemic accelerated this kind of change, especially inside the company, campus network and also work from remote anywhere. So that\u2019s where we see that pretty strong growth. And also a lot of connected devices like in the OT space, also, we see very strong growth. Like we mentioned, SD-WAN grew 60% and the OT growth 75%, and we\u2019re still keeping growth and gaining market share there. And at the same time, have to secure the whole infrastructure not only expanding our network security to the networking side, but also like beyond the network security, with the end point, with the cloud with all the other like application level from email, web, working together. So we do see all these -- we keep saying the convergence and consolidation will benefit Fortinet multiple years going forward, it\u2019s more long-term growth driver for us. And we prepared this in the last like 22 years since start company with investment like from ASIC technology for the R&D with most of the product internally developed to integrate, automate together. And so, we do see the time is starting coming and for all this investment starting to see some good return. And also, we feel we have a very healthy business model since IPO now is about 13 years now, want to maintain the balanced growth and also healthy margin. And that is what makes the company to last longer. And at the same time, we\u2019re also kind of keeping invest in the long term to follow the change and also keep up the innovation and quickly customer benefit from our innovation and also the long-term investment. Keith Jensen : Yes. And Hamza, I think your speculation about where the larger or the timing comes in is accurate and that it\u2019s going to be in that 1/3 of our business that is large enterprise. One, the dollars are larger, obviously. And so, they\u2019re going to -- customers spend a little more time with the ROI. But I think more importantly, and to your kind of second point, your question on, by adding in more of the platform products into a deal, you\u2019re perhaps a little more likely to run into additional competitors or people internally that are champions of those competitors. And so, there\u2019s a little more than it takes to get across the finish line because they are more complex in that way. I\u2019ll fill the void here. As a reminder, we did 122 deals over $1 million in the quarter, which -- that\u2019s a pretty fantastic number for us. Operator : Our next question is from Gray Powell with BTIG. Gray Powell : So, Keith, I know you hit on this once or twice already, but I just want to make sure I understand a dynamic on the services billings. So, if I back out product revenue from short-term billings, it looks like the annual recurring component of billings actually accelerated pretty nicely. I\u2019m calculating like 29% in Q1, improving to 40% in Q2. I don\u2019t need you to bless the numbers, but directionally, does that seem right to you? And then, if so, how much of that was driven by pricing dynamics that you talked about versus just the natural cadence of the business? Keith Jensen : I do think your math is directionally correct, but it\u2019s lot more time to get anything more about how actually it may or may not be because kind of looking at a different way. And I would say, again, if you think about the timing of where -- when a price increase is effective, right? It\u2019s got to go through the process of being preannounced to the channel partners, they get, I think, 60 days of advanced notice and then whether it\u2019s actually start to have an impact on it. But keeping that in mind, you do see the impact on pricing actions fairly quickly on product revenue and on billings, whether it\u2019s a product or whether it is a service item, right? You will see it there. But on service revenue, you won\u2019t see that benefit for an extended period of time. And I think one thing that may help people, if you think back of our shift from 8 by 5 support to 24 by 7 support. We talked about that for several years because when we turned off the 8 by 5 support, with that came a price lift. And the question that we were addressing, seen for 8, 12 quarters probably in a row, was how was that mix shifting and how was that coming into it. And we were providing information back then about all the buildings, so to speak, are in the 24 by 7, but you\u2019re not seeing the revenue mix that way because it\u2019s kind of -- that mix has to evolve over time as you go through the installed base. Price increases for service revenue, this is just another flavor of the same thing that way. You\u2019re going to see the benefit over a much longer period of time on the service revenue line. You will see the benefit in billings much sooner, and that\u2019s why we gave that information earlier, and you kind of -- Gray, you\u2019re looking at it, that\u2019s a very good leading indicator of where service revenue growth is going to go in the future. Gray Powell : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just a real quick follow-up. You mentioned $25 million headwinds on service revenue from Russia, which is a new headwind. Does that apply to billings as well, or was that purely a revenue dynamic? Keith Jensen : That was a revenue dynamic, and I would probably say 40% of that probably, 30% to 50% of that would have been a billings dynamic, in terms of where we were from the beginning of the year where we\u2019ll end up now. Operator : Our next question is from John Weidemoyer with William Blair. John Weidemoyer : On your platform extension, cloud security capabilities. I\u2019m curious of the type of customer profile that\u2019s interested there. I suspect they\u2019re probably an existing Fortinet customer that\u2019s transitioning to the cloud. And I\u2019m curious if there are also maybe a fabric mesh. And so there might be an all-in customer -- an all-in Fortinet type customer. Can you talk about the characteristics of the people that are going down? Ken Xie : We do see the cloud security growing well, pretty much on a similar pace as other networking appliance growth. And also, we do see a lot of cloud security come from the service providers, especially carrier service provider, someone also combined with an offer SDWAN and some also with OT, all this together. So that\u2019s what we keep saying, for better security, the new secured whole infrastructure, not just the cloud, but also appliances and some other product infrastructure. So, we do see more and more customers want to consider overall together. So basically, cost security also drive a lot of other part of cybersecurity, other part of infrastructure for cyber security. And also, we do believe long term, the service provider, both in the telecom space, also in the securities integrate and also like even a cloud provider, will play a very, very important role on this security, especially in the service part. And that\u2019s where we also want to keep supporting them. So, that\u2019s where we see that is kind of a still more hybrid environment going forward and especially with more and more device connected with a lot of other, we see kind of the whole infrastructure security more and more important connect, consider all parts of security together is quite important. Operator : Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg Mizuho : I\u2019d like to ask about your backlog, which has significantly and consistently increased for each of the last three quarters. It\u2019s dramatically above year ago levels. So, Keith, you made it clear that the backlog should further rise by year-end, which is great. But at the same time, it\u2019s not going to grow forever. And it\u2019s common to see dips in the company\u2019s backlog due to seasonality, significant order shipments, cancellations, et cetera. And so, it would just be helpful to get your sense of perhaps when we begin to see ebbs and flows in the backlog metric. If you could offer anything there, that would be helpful. Keith Jensen : When supply chain is going to get better Ken. So, I\u2019ll let you handle that one. Ken Xie : If you compare to end of Q1, we increased backlog $120-some million. And then end of Q2, we increased about $72 million. It\u2019s a little bit better increase, less than end of Q1 and also less than end of Q4. So, there is some kind of improvement on increased backlog. But also, we put a lot of effort to sourcing different parts or different vendor designed products. So, you see the product line we got quite broad right now. And also can help leverage some kind of -- I mean, some alternative of kind of a more broad supply chain for us. So, that\u2019s why I do believe because the demand is still very, very strong, and so we do see probably keeping -- get a little bit better and better. But like Keith said, we probably not expect backlog will reduce in Q3, Q4. But the increase probably will be less each quarter, I\u2019ll put it this way. And then maybe next year, we\u2019ll see -- starting to see some kind of improvement within the backlog. But overall, with our engineering effort, with the kind of the investment we\u2019ve made in the operation in the manufacture, we do see since that get improved a little bit better now. Keith Jensen : I think it was a logical place to have questions and Ken\u2019s comments are great. I would just add to that, keep in mind, the -- this is why we provide some of the metrics there. We\u2019re not -- there\u2019s not airplane orders, right? These are relatively small dollar items compared to what you may see in other industries. And that\u2019s why we gave some of the metrics on the size, if you will, and the fact also that their existing customers and many of those have been partially fulfilled. And we all have the same concern and the question is, how do you get comfortable that that backlog is sticky and it\u2019s going to be here when the product and the supply chain loses up. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re giving those metrics for people to get some sort of context. But keep in mind these are comparatively to other industries, construction industry, airline, what have you, these are very small dollar amounts. Ken Xie : Also, the age of our backlog probably much better than our competitors. Like Keith mentioned in the last 2, 3 quarters, every quarter, even if we increase the backlog and we fulfill probably like 60%, even over 60% of previous quarter backlog. So, that\u2019s making our age in the backlog also pretty short, few months compared to most other competitors sometimes may take 1 to 2 years to deliver. So, that gives us a pretty good position and also the customer trust continue working with us during this supply chain issue. And at the same time, we offer quite a broad product. There\u2019s always some kind of alternative product because suggest out customer to use if 1 or 2 provide some shortage. I think we deliver over 90% of any booking in every quarter, I believe. Gregg Mizuho : Yes, the bookings... Ken Xie : Between 90% to 95% of the booking, we deliver the product. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Andrew Nowinski : Congrats on another great quarter. I had a question on free cash flow. So I think you said you expect the low-end supply appliances to dramatically improve in Q3. So is there a margin or free cash flow impact that mix shift in Q3? And then related to that, given the shortfall on services that we saw in Q2 and the negative impact it had on your free cash flow, should we expect free cash flow to rebound in Q3 and Q4, or are you assuming the linearity remains unchanged in those quarters? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes. I\u2019m assuming the linearity is -- I don\u2019t really have any reason to think that\u2019s going to be any different. I\u2019m looking for a reason to find, but I certainly have not found one yet. So, when we look at what our expectations are internally, we don\u2019t guide to free cash flow, we\u2019re trying to give information is helpful to others. I would assume that -- I have no reason to assume anything other than we\u2019ll still see more of the same, if you will. And then, I think the first part of your question was -- you asked about low end and about margin. And maybe I can offer a little bit of commentary there. When you look at our FortiGate firewall product families, the entry level, the low end, you call it, mid-range and high end. In general, the margins increase -- the gross margin increases as you move up from the entry level to the higher end of it. So from that aspect of it, and that\u2019s why the comment in the script that there can be gross margin volatility both from the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken and the discounting as well, but also the mix of our product. So, in a quarter that we see a higher mix of higher-end firewall shipments, margins will be higher by definition. But there\u2019s many puts and takes in there that we -- when we go through the gross margin guidance that we give, hopefully, we\u2019re considering all the different puts and takes that are in there, not just the mix of the inventory and the pricing actions. Operator : Our last question comes from Roger Boyd with UBS. Roger Boyd : Keith, I was curious just to go back to the backlog for a second. You had mentioned the split being about 50-50 between FortiGate and networking portfolio. Just wondering if you could talk about how you expect that mix to trend through the end of the year? And I guess, the follow-up to that is what you\u2019re seeing around the supply constraints between those two product portfolios? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes, I might double check the numbers. I think it was 50%, 50-40 between FortiGate and networking equipment. I have it backwards. Networking equipment is 50% and firewalls 40% and then cash and dollars the remainder of it. I think everything that we\u2019ve seen to read in here can probably know more, the pressure certainly seems to be for the term, more intense on switches and access points than they do on firewalls. And for a lot of the reasons I think we\u2019re more successful with firewalls. Ken Xie : Yes, I agree. Probably on the direction wise, we do see the FortiGate inventory will keep improving. So probably the percentage, maybe a little bit more on the backlog, probably a little bit more towards the switching and AP side, which is probably the whole industry is suffering some play issue, because we are more able to redesign and also use our own ASIC, which is also helping kind of reduce the backlog and supply on time for the customer. But it\u2019s -- from the beginning of this backlog issue almost one year ago, definitely, we see the shifting a little bit more towards the networking side that have longer backlog. Operator : I would now like to turn it back to Peter Salkowski. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Hope. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Citibank, Evercore, Stifel and Goldman Sachs during the third quarter. Fireside chats will be available through our IR website. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to contact me and have a great rest of your day. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call to review our outstanding third quarter 2022 results. Revenue for the quarter grew 33%, significantly outpacing the industry growth rate. We believe that customer recognition of the exceptional value proposition we provided by our high performance Forti-ASIC technology and integrated FortiOS operating system is driving our ability to take cyber security market share. Product revenue growth was very strong at 39%, extending our position as a product revenue leader in the cybersecurity industry. Our product revenue performance reflects the strong demand we have built over the past 18 months across our security solutions along with the successful execution of our internal teams in managing the supply chain challenges. Three growth drivers, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of security and networking, and the consolidation of security functionality and the vendors, together with the opportunity to upsell additional security services to our significant installed base are expected to drive future growth. First, the threat landscape, including ransomware, continue to expand and evolving targeting companies of all size, location and industries. To counter the threat landscape, we are implementing our unique Universal ZTNA across a wide range of customers, driving triple-digit growth for this product and delivering a comprehensive approach to zero trust that is consistent for any user, anywhere, on any device and supporting today\u2019s hybrid workforce. Second, for years Fortinet has led strategies around the convergence of networking and security. We estimate the total addressable market for networking and security will increase from $54 billion today to $73 billion in 2026. Convergence accelerates digital transformation and substantially reduce operational costs by combining networking modernization with dynamic security that seamlessly span every part of the network, especially now that many companies are merging SOC and NOC operations together. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies including Network Firewall and Segmentation, Secure SD-WAN, OT Security, and 5G in a single operating system which can be deployed as hardware, software, cloud, and As a Service. Fortinet continues to gain Secure SD-WAN market share as our integrated Secure SD-WAN solution delivers better security, performance and efficiencies over more traditional offerings. In the quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings grew over 45% and 75%, respectively, and together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. We believe we can achieve number one market share in SD-WAN in the next couple of years. Today, we announced the FortiGate 1000F, our latest innovation in converging networking and security. Powered by our new NP7 SPU, the 1000F delivers 5 to 10 times higher performance across six major network security functions while consuming 80% less power versus competitive solutions. The lower power consumption was a contributing factor in our top 2% ranking in S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Our third growth driver is the consolidation of a vendors and product functionality. With Forti-ASIC\u2019s huge computing power advantage, FortiOS can integrate more security functions than our competitors, together with over 30 key products ranging from endpoint to network to the cloud security. Fortinet provides our customers with easier operation while lower the management costs and the total cost of ownership. Additionally, we are very focused on upselling value-added security services to our significant customer base. According to IDC\u2019s second quarter unit share data, Fortinet hold a number one market share position for units shipped at 43%, up 210 basis points. We expect to reach 50% market share in the next few years. This leadership position and the substantial installed base creates attractive economy of a scale and the opportunity to upsell additional security services. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Keith Jensen : All right. Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let\u2019s start with an overview of our strong third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.15 billion was another quarterly record for Fortinet, increasing 33% year-over-year and 12% sequentially; our highest third quarter sequential growth rate in eleven years. We continue to deliver better than industry average top-line growth and generate strong profitability. Our operating margin exceeded guidance at over 28%, driving the adjusted free cash flow margin to 40%. Our history as a public company has revolved around the Rule of 40, measured as the combined total of revenue growth and operating margin. Impressively, the Q3 total came in at over 60. We continue to see success in our strategy for expanding further into the large enterprise segment. The number of deals over $1 million increased over 80% to 153 deals. The total billings value of deals over $1 million more than doubled driven by a record number of deals over $5 million, and G2000 bookings increased over 40%. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid customer demand across both our Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies and the exceptional performance of the team in a challenging supply chain environment. We believe the investments we\u2019ve made in building our platform and our go-to-market engine enables our customers\u2019 digital transformation journey. Our platform strategy allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities while consolidating cybersecurity products, providing security across their entire digital infrastructure while lowering their operating costs. Recently, the Forrester Wave Enterprise Firewalls report acknowledged the success of our investment strategy, placing Fortinet as a leader for the first time in its history. According to Forrester, \u201cFortinet excels at performance for value and offers a wide array of adjacent services. Long known for its bang-for-the-buck approach to network security, Fortinet has built a flexible and capable platform with its flagship product, the FortiGate Firewall.\" Taking a closer look at the income statement, product revenue grew 39%. Product revenue growth for our Core and Enhanced Platform Technology products increased 29% and 51%, respectively. The product revenue growth rate accelerated over 4 points sequentially, especially impressive given it is our toughest year-over-year comparison in over 10 years. Service revenue was up 28%, accelerating 3 points sequentially driven by strong product revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters that increased our term deferred revenue growth rates. Support and related service revenue was up 28%, accelerating over 2 points sequentially to $311 million. While security subscription service revenue was up 29%, accelerating 4 points sequentially to $370 million. Total revenue in the Americas increased 34%. EMEA revenue increased 37% and APAC posted revenue growth of 23%. Total gross margin at 76.2% exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 61% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Services gross margin of 86.6% was flat year-over-year, but up 70 basis points sequentially. Operating margin of 28.3% was up 250 basis points, benefiting from FX and the operating margin leverage that comes with higher revenues. Shifting to billings. Billings of $1.4 billion were up 33%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of billings growth in excess of 30%. Core platform billings were up 27% and accounted for 67% of total billings. As shown on Slide 6, we entry-level FortiGates posted very strong billings growth with the mix shifting 16 points in their favor, driven by demand and as we expected improved supply. Enhanced platform technology billings were up 45% and accounted for 33% of total billings, a positive mix shift of 3 points. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 29 months. Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow was $395 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $464 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. DSOs were down five days sequentially while increasing 12 days year-over-year to 75 days. Cash taxes were $69 million. Capital expenditures were $88 million, including $69 million for real estate investments. We repurchased 10.2 million shares of our common stock for a cost of $500 million, bringing the year-to-date totals to 36 million shares at a total cost of $2 billion. The remaining repurchase authorization totals $530 million. Regarding backlog, the backlog at the end of the third quarter was up slightly from the end of the prior quarter, with FortiGate Firewalls accounting for just one-third of total backlog. We expect fourth quarter ending backlog to be relatively consistent with the third quarter backlog as we are seeing early signs of a transition back to more normalized customer buying behaviors. Moving to guidance. The current environment favors a Fortinet style platform that offers integrated solutions and strong security capabilities and an attractive cost of ownership. To enhance our ability to capture our share of the large market opportunity, we plan to continue to invest in innovation across our integrated platform offerings. Now I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the fourth quarter summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. And to start, as part of the Q4 guidance setting process, we considered several factors, including the greater macro uncertainty today and with it, the increased risk of forecasting the timing of certain larger transactions. The transition to more normalized customers buying behaviors, which means there is less of an emphasis on ordering to get a place online. And for comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2021, when supply was tighter, backlog increased over $120 million and contributed to 49% bookings growth. And lastly, elevated year early year top line comparisons that include certain onetime items adding a couple of points of service revenue growth and fully cycling the Alaxala acquisition. In response, we have slightly widened our top line guidance ranges. For the fourth quarter, we expect to again reach the Rule of 60. And with that, the key metrics include billings in the range of $1.665 billion to $1.720 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 30%. Revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.315 billion, which represents growth of 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.40, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. We expect capital expenditures of $75 million to $85 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And for the full year, we expect billings and revenue growth to exceed 30% for the second consecutive year. Billings in the range of $5.540 billion to $5.595 billion, which at the midpoint represents 33%, revenue in the range of $4.410 billion to $4.450 billion, which represents growth of 33%. Perhaps for context, we should note at the midpoint, these full year billings and revenue growth rates are 3 points higher than the initial growth rates we provided in early February, despite the start of the war in Ukraine in late February, significant increases in interest rates and increasing uncertainty in the macro environment, and importantly, full year backlog is expected to be above the February estimate of $350 million. Total service revenue in the range of $2.645 billion to $2.655 billion, which represents growth of 27% and implies full year product revenue growth of 42%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% at the midpoint a year-over-year increase of 30 basis points. And again, for context, at the midpoint, gross and operating margin expectations were 50 and 100 basis points above the February guide, respectively. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.15, which assumes a share count of between $800 million and $810 million. We expect full year capital expenditures of $325 million to $335 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17%. We expect cash taxes to be $265 million. Before wrapping up, I\u2019d like to offer some preliminary thoughts on 2023 and our midterm targets on the heels of a very strong set of growth in 2021 and in 2022. We continue to successfully balance growth and profitability, while investing in longer-term innovation and go-to-market initiatives to future growth. The strength of our business model includes its diversification, margins that provide capacity for future investment and a rich mix of higher-margin recurring service revenues. As we saw in the highs of pandemic, the diversification helps mitigate the risk of economic slowdowns. Specifically, in 2020, we delivered operating margins of nearly 27%, adjusted free cash flow margin of over 38% and top line growth of 20%. And during the past 12 months, we have really exceeded our target operating margin targets, while increasing our engineering headcount by about 20% and significantly increasing our future sales capacity by over 25%, including a greater than 50% increase in new, non-tenured, salespeople. While we will provide more detailed 2023 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results, it\u2019s worth noting this revenue accounts for 60% of total revenue, with gross margins hovering above 85%. We see continued service revenue growth driven by two years of very strong product revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters accelerating short-term deferred revenue growth. With a strong business model and the history of being able to execute, we are confident that our momentum will continue and point to our key growth drivers, including strategic investments, the heightened threat environment, the convergence of networking and security, the cybersecurity consolidation. Cyber securities are not immune to economic slowdowns is expected to remain a relatively safe harbor. As such, we remain on track to achieve all of our medium-term financial targets from our May 2022 Analyst Day, including $10 billion in billings and $8 billion in revenue in 2025, each representing a 22% three-year CAGR from the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. The targets also included an average non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25% for the four years from 2022 to 2025 and a 2025 adjusted free cash flow margin in the mid-to-high 30% range. Illustrating our long-term focus for balancing growth and profitability, our targets remain committed to the Rule of 40 or better. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. [Operator Instructions] Eric, we are ready for Q&A. Operator : Excellent. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Fatima Boolani at Citi. Fatima, your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking my questions. Keith, this one\u2019s for you, just with respect to the 4Q guidance and the outlook. I appreciate you kind of breaking down the three principal factors that went into that. But I wanted to dig in specifically on the comment you made about normalized buying behavior as it relates to the backlog build. So I think what I inferred from your comments is that while the backlog is going to be sequentially up and sort of higher than what you initially pointed out to be maybe $350 million of ending backlog. That\u2019s certainly below the $500 million that you were previously telegraphing. So I just wanted to better understand sort of the modulation downward on backlog there and how the sort of normalized buying behavior contributes to that? And then I\u2019ll ask my follow-up. Keith Jensen : Okay. I think when we talk about normalized buying behavior, I think that we certainly saw some enterprise customers in the U.S. during the supply chain challenges. They were placing orders to get in line to hold their place in line for when the inventory is available. And I think I\u2019ll say a year ago or so that, that was an appropriate behavior when there was a lot of uncertainty around the supply chain and maybe they\u2019re planning what we\u2019re going to do in 2022. I think that somewhat in general now, and maybe Ken will talk more about this, I think people are getting is that the \u2013 certainly, we are, but the supply chain is a little bit easier to forecast and somewhat easier to manage. I don\u2019t mean by any stretch easy, but I do think it\u2019s easier. And with that, I think you\u2019re starting to see the market drift back towards the emphasis start to what I would call more traditional buying, which is when they need it, they\u2019re placing the order. Ken Xie : And also looking at the composition of our backlog, it\u2019s only one-third or less related to our network security platform FortiGate more than half related to like a switch in AP, which is a networking equipment which is kind of an industry problem in the networking side because the networking device tend to be more changeable, more standard driven. So a lot of customers, sometimes double, triple order try to get ahead of whatever the supply chain issue and also some of them can easily cancel once they got the product. So that\u2019s why we feel probably keeping track in the backlog may not be the best way to forecast the business, and we should be more focused on security, security related, especially driving the future service based on huge FortiGate installation base. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. And Keith, just a clarification on the services revenue trajectory and more broadly thinking about next year. So we saw the reacceleration this quarter in services revenue. So wondering if you could give us a quick update on how the delayed registrations from earlier in the year and transactions from earlier in the year are trending and how we should think about that filtering and flowing into our models for next year? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think we\u2019ve been messaging throughout the quarter at various conferences that \u2013 and even in the prior quarter that we had a clear expectation that service revenue growth has accelerated. So we\u2019re very pleased to see that. I think there\u2019s a number of things that are providing a tailwind into that. Customer registering units is part of that. I think also the price increase is making its way first into orders and deferred revenue and now into the income statement. Keeping in mind that we have contracts at sometimes or as long as five years, that will give you a sense of how long the tailwind may relate to price increases as we will continue to cycle through renewals at old prices and replace them with new contracts. So I think we feel good about the direction of the service revenue and the margins that it provides, together with the fact that it\u2019s 60% of our business. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia at Barclays. Saket, your line is open. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Thanks very much for taking my question here. Keith, maybe just to start with you. I\u2019d love to just zero in on product revenue growth a little bit for this year. Can you just maybe talk about some of the growth drivers for product revenue this year that aren\u2019t expected to repeat next year? Again, very helpful detail kind of thinking about total billings for kind of following years. But for product, what are some of the one-off things that we should be keeping in mind like in Alaxala like price adjustments, just to sort of think about what normalized growth in product might look as we start to think about the following years. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think Alaxala is probably the easiest one to talk about in terms of providing numbers. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that their revenue stream was probably something in the order of $130 million to $140 million when we acquired them and reminded people that they are a March 31 year-end, so their fourth quarter is a little bit off cycle. I think that it\u2019s growth single digits. So I think that probably gives people a good level expectation reminder there that our interest in Alaxala is a lot to run at the IP and some opportunities that we have there to do things more longer term, if you will. In terms of other unique things about product revenue in the quarter, I mean, I think that as the backlog comes into revenue as we go through the end of 2022 here and certainly into 2023 is tend to provide, again, a fairly significant tailwind to what the product revenue growth will be in 2023, assuming we get the drawn in backlog that we may see. Ken Xie : Yes. Also, we believe the growth driver, especially the converged network and security. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a slowdown. We\u2019ll be keeping driving the product revenue growth in the next 5 to 10 years. You can see the secure SD-WAN and OT both had a pretty healthy growth. And at the same time, we will continue to growth in the next 5 to 10 years in a huge market potential. Saket Kalia : Got it. Got it. Maybe for my follow-up, really for both of you, I\u2019ll make a jump ball here. I think in Q3, we had operating margins of about 28%. I think the guide for Q4 is for margins a little bit higher. When I think that long-term guide out to 25% of at least, it feels like you\u2019re doing a lot better than that here in the near-term. Maybe the question is, how do you sort of think about that balance, right, in terms of growth, maybe moderating or normalizing as we mentioned versus sort of that long-term margin? Ken Xie : I think that\u2019s where \u2013 if you look at the 13-year history, we as a public company, we always balance the growth and with the margin. So that\u2019s where we feel the 25% above is a healthy margin and then we can also give the money to invest in the growth become a leader in the space. That\u2019s where we\u2019re continue to balance, but if the growth slowdown definitely will be more helping in the margin. So that\u2019s what we keep in saying the Rule of 40, probably in the last few quarters, we kind of even reached the Rule of 60 now. So that\u2019s where also \u2013 when the growth slowed down and sometimes the service revenue has a higher margin, which can also help in the margin, but we do expect the growth will continue in the next few years with the three growth drivers I mentioned and plus additional service revenue to our big installation base, a lot of are not quite unable the security service revenue yet. Keith Jensen : Yes. I would probably certainly agree with Ken operate just a little more detail on it. Keeping in mind that our \u2013 we sell in U.S. dollars, so there\u2019s really not a direct FX impact there. On the revenue line, obviously, you can get into certain countries where the pressure on discounting, if you will, because of exchange rates can be a little more intense. But on the OpEx, because 30% of our business is in the U.S. and the rest is international. We do get a tailwind from OpEx from the strength of the U.S. And I think you\u2019re seeing that in Q3 and you\u2019re seeing that in Q4. And probably why it\u2019s important is that we\u2019ve talked for a number of years now around and made reference to 25% operating margin. If you go back four years ago, five years ago, it was probably a target to get to 25% operating margin. And since then, we\u2019ve talked about averaging 25%, so I think a floor of 25%. It has certainly served us well as a way to help other people understand about how we invest in the business, and as Ken makes reference to it. As we have funds available over that 25% operating margin, it creates opportunities for some, not necessarily all that you\u2019re seeing currently of those margin dollars to be reinvested back in innovation and back into our go-to-market strategy. Saket Kalia : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Okay. We\u2019re just lining up the next question. And the next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala at Morgan Stanley. Hamza, your line is open. Please go ahead. Hamza Fodderwala : Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Keith, on the backlog, I appreciate, look, sometimes you have too many metrics that creates too many noise. And on the supply chain front, it seems like it\u2019s getting a bit clearer. But could you give us any more granularity on how that backlog and that booking trajectory looked relative to your guidance, which I think when you guided to it, you were saying about 36% growth at the midpoint for bookings. So just curious how that shook out in Q3. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think I\u2019ll come back to kind of Ken\u2019s commentary around backlog, which is really what kind of drives the conversation about bookings. I think a year ago, when we introduced the backlog metric, there was a lot of uncertainty around what the supply chain crisis was going to look like and how it might impact our business and the purpose of providing the backlog disclosure and the booking disclosure then was to kind of round out and help investors understand more about our business model as we go forward. And as we heard in the question earlier from one of the questions, at the beginning of year, what kind of a swag \u2013 that kind of swag backlog growth of $350 million in the first quarter and then it came back and said, in the second quarter, maybe it\u2019s going to get closer to $500 million for the full year. And now I think we\u2019re looking at a number that\u2019s going to be less than that, something in the floor probably seems reasonable from where we\u2019re at. And I think with net-net, the message there\u2019s two messages to I think we\u2019re becoming much more comfortable with our ability to execute in this environment and maybe some easing in the environment itself. And then secondly, I think that it was always our intention. I think we messaged this that these will be short-term metrics that we provide \u2013 and I think they\u2019ve served us and our investors well for an extended period of time, but it\u2019s probably time now that we feel that we\u2019ve gotten a better control on it to bring us more \u2013 bring us back online, if you will, with what our industry competitors are disclosing and not disclosing. Hamza Fodderwala : Makes total sense. Just to follow up really quickly. I mean, is it fair to say that your bookings growth is still higher than your billings growth. Obviously, your backlog grew. So you\u2019re still expecting underlying bookings to be higher than 30% this year. Keith Jensen : Yes, we\u2019re not going down to the detail of talking specifically about bookings, as I just mentioned going forward from our backlog, more than what we\u2019ve given to this point. Hamza Fodderwala : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Rob Owens at Piper Sandler. Rob, your line is open. Please go ahead. Rob Owens : Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from curious with the supply chain getting a little bit easier, how you\u2019re thinking of about gross margin, both kind of in the short term as well as the medium term. Thanks. Ken Xie : I think the component and also the cost continue to go up. So that\u2019s where \u2013 and also, we still have a pretty tight inventory to make most shipments shipping by air instead of by ocean. So that\u2019s where \u2013 so we\u2019ll keep it adjusted by all these costs and probably some of the wet ourselves, some of them we may do some price increase, but we also feel even some price increase, we continue to have a price advantage compared to competitive industry average with our own products. So that\u2019s where the margin we feel probably will be more stabilized. And that\u2019s probably the overall supply probably keep improving. Keith Jensen : Yes. Ken, spot on with that. I probably a couple a little more granularity. I think if you maybe look at it between product gross margin and services gross margin, the product win is the one that\u2019s probably more volatile related to what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ve certainly heard commentary that maybe things are easing a little bit, the chip manufacturers, but I would say that there\u2019s no indication of any sort of cost reduction savings that are coming from either chip manufacturers or the component suppliers. So what we\u2019ll see how that plays out. Our strategy has been, and Ken alluded to this, is that we came into this economic cycle a year ago, believing that we had a price performance advantage and that we could raise prices and our target was really to pass along most but not all the price increases, call it plus or minus 1% margin. It\u2019s kind of our target every quarter. It doesn\u2019t fall that way every quarter because of various variables. And I would imagine that to the extent that prices can remain to be elevated as we move into 2023, that\u2019s kind of the starting point for our price strategy into 2023 as well, again, because we have not seen signs that we\u2019ve lost the pro formas advantage. In fact, we continue to win that way. Service is a little bit different. I mean, the largest cost component in services is labor. And if you look back, we\u2019re a company that has its annual merit increase in the first or second month of the year, so you kind of get a rather immediate job on the COGS line from those \u2013 from the compensation increases, which is certainly appropriate and then you have to grow the service revenue into it. And I think that\u2019s part of the conversation about why you saw the reference to sequential margin increases. On the revenue side, it gets fairly complex. Well, maybe that complex. But thinking through how price increases that started about a year ago and kind of at a quarterly pace, if you will, how those price increases will make their way first on the balance sheet in deferred revenue and to what extent each item is going to reflect all those price increases and then how it will come off the balance sheet in future periods. So you will get tailwind from the price increases. And I would expect that particular tailwind should continue to, for an extended period of time. Rob Owens : Ken and Keith, thank you. Operator : Okay. Our next question, just connecting the line now comes from Shaul Eyal at Cowen. Shaul, your line is open. Please go ahead. Shaul Eyal : Thank you so much. Good afternoon, guys. Keith, question on APAC, softest performance in, I think, like two years, what was driving that? And I have a follow-up. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think we\u2019ve made a leadership change there around the end of June, beginning of July, we had a retirement. And I think that\u2019s just kind of the transition of leaders, if you will, is one was exiting into retirement and we brought so on. But I think we feel very, very good about in terms of their abilities. And I think the other part of it is you\u2019re starting to see the lapping effect of Alaxala because all of Alaxala sitting in APAC. And so you\u2019re going to see that now roll up on basically the full quarter comparisons that impact. Shaul Eyal : Understood. Understood. And on FortiGate sales, maybe looking at it from a tier perspective, it was slightly more mixed than prior quarters, entry level actually representing most growth versus the mid-range and high end. So any color on that front? Ken Xie : That\u2019s where the \u2013 we see pretty strong growth related to the SD-WAN and OT, which more using the low end unit and at the same time, the supply chain improvements help a little bit. That\u2019s where the \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to shipping more product in the low line side. We still have some backlog in the middle high end, but it\u2019s a low end had some improvement by redesign some of the products and also better supply chain right now Keith Jensen : Yes. Ken talked about this in the past, the ability to introduce the new 70F product in the second quarter. We were a little bit hamstrung in Q2 and the beginning of Q3 even back into Q1 really on the low end. And I think we kind of messaged a bit in our conversations over the last quarter or so that we expected low end supply availability to really jump, if you will, in the third quarter, and we did see that. So it\u2019s really more of a supply conversation in some ways as much as it is a demand conversation. Shaul Eyal : Thank you for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Okay. We\u2019re just bringing our next caller live. Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Brad, your line is live. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much and thank you for taking the questions. Ken, just a big picture question for you to start out with. You mentioned Fortinet success is in part coming from the industry trend of vendor and product consolidation. Why is Fortinet so well positioned as a platform for consolidation? And how does this inform your product and corporate development roadmap in terms of the need for even more product breadth to compete with other platform competitors out there that keep adding additional functionality. Ken Xie : I think we have a few unique advantage. The first from day one, we developed the FortiASIC, which have a huge companion power increase compared to using traditional CPU, but also FortiASIC also working side by side with the CPU. So that\u2019s the huge computing power advantage comes from FortiASIC give us more computing power for the FortiOS to run more function, more security function including a lot of networking function. So that advantage is none of our competitors have that. So that\u2019s making us keeping driving the market share and also the unit shipment, I mentioned, we like 43% of our market shareholder unit shipment there. So that\u2019s what we keeping \u2013 give us a long-term growth going forward because also on the convergence of security networking the secure computing power it must have a huge need to address both security and networking function there. Second is for the FortiOS is well integrate together with more function, leverage, security and power. So that\u2019s also kind of a huge advantage for us compared to some other competitor, whether they have to use like a different blade or different functions. They have to go to some different parts or even to the cloud to address some secure computing power there. And then third one, we also have about 30 different products, mostly home developed and integrate, automate together. So that\u2019s also what helping drive we call the wider security fabric on called a mesh network. So that\u2019s also helping the customer to lower the management cost and total cost of ownership. I think all these three factors we\u2019re keeping driving Fortinet better position for the consolidation, both on the product functionality and also on different products into a single vendor platform strategy. Brad Zelnick : Ken, thank you for that. And it\u2019s clearly working by your strategy. Maybe Keith just for you, you\u2019ve disclosed quite a bit of information so much so that I have a very simple question that I just might have missed. But can you just very clearly explained for the reduction in the full year billings guidance for \u2013 that you\u2019ve given us now the update on with these results. Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think you\u2019re talking about full year fourth quarter, one of the same at this point. And I would really just point to the macro environment and what we\u2019ve seen really in the \u2013 over the last 90 days in terms of economic activity, if you will, I think when you look at how that manifests somewhat specifically, I think I\u2019m getting a little more cautious in some of the forecasting of close timing on some of the very large deals. We\u2019ve been very successful over the last few years. You saw some of the numbers about enterprise penetration with our growth in the enterprise. The deals have actually gotten significantly larger as we\u2019ve gone forward. And I think it\u2019s appropriate in that environment to be a little more cautious on what we expect to close rates to be. The business itself is very healthy. If I look at the end of the spectrum, the small enterprise part of the business, for example, it actually outgrew the other two parts of the business in the last quarter by \u2013 it took about a point of mix, I think, from the other two. So I feel \u2013 feel good about the business, but just a little cautious about the macro environment as we go forward, how to forecast what\u2019s coming from the sales team. Brad Zelnick : It makes total sense and in line with a lot of other data points that we\u2019re all seeing out there. I guess just maybe as you think about what contributes to that, is there \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s anything competitive, but what are the customers doing? Are they shrinking deal sizes? Are they just taking more time and sweating out their existing assets? Any other color on that would be helpful. Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see deal sizes getting smaller one because we\u2019re moving into the enterprise. If we were more established there and it was just kind of the same routine over and over, the fact that we\u2019re growing in the enterprise, and again, you saw the numbers is going to by itself, increase our average deal size. I certainly do feel that there\u2019s caution is corporate America and the rest of the world is probably going through their budgeting cycles right now and looking at what they\u2019re planning for, not only the end of 2022 and 2023. I think the other aspect of that, and again, I think this is fairly consistent with the other comments we\u2019ve probably heard. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good time to really get in a position of forecasting some sort of significant budget flush in the fourth quarter. If it develops, that would be fantastic. But I think prudence is a little bit appropriate here. Brad Zelnick : It makes total sense to me. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. And next up, we have Shrenik Kothari, Shrenik from Robert Baird, your line is open. Thank you. Shrenik Kothari at Robert Baird, your line is open. Okay. We will move on to the next question. Please standby. Tal Liani at Bank of America. Tal, your line is open. Madeline Brooks : Hi, here is Madeline on for Tal today. Just two quick ones for me, and I apologize if this has already been mentioned or running between a few earnings right now. But just to be \u2013 just as Steve very pointed about it, last quarter, we heard bookings and bookings was a little bit softer than expected. This quarter, no disclosure in bookings. And again, I apologize, this was already mentioned. But just want to get, Keith, from your perspective directly, why no bookings for this quarter after a weaker quarter of booking last quarter. Keith Jensen : Yes. We talked a link of this before you get on the call and for everybody\u2019s benefit, I\u2019ll just quickly kind of go through it. Yes, I think when we got into this conversation a year ago, we felt the backlog, which is really the driver of the bookings conversation was something that we thought was important to investors to understand and be able to track how we\u2019re performing as a business and what they\u2019re seeing in the drivers. As we\u2019ve moved forward, I think that if you fast forward a year later, I think we feel more comfortable now about some of the backlog forecasting. And earlier, we made reference that backlog may exit the year, something closer to 400 or a little bit north of that. And so with that in mind, I think we\u2019re bringing ourselves back into what I would call industry norms, where nobody else really discloses this information, but we thought it was appropriate for the first year. I would also offer one comment about backlog that\u2019s important, and we get a lot of conversations around cancellation rates. Our cancellation rate has been extremely consistent at about 4% each and every quarter. Ken Xie : Also, the composition of backlog is kind of different now compared to one year ago, which is one year ago, I have to say, majority of that \u2013 related to the FortiGate and now FortiGate is less than one-third of the whole backlog and the majority of backlog that come from the switch and AP Wi-Fi, which is also kind of a more industry problem, which switch and AP more easily customer can change in different vendor compared to the security product, they have to design in, they have to a high switching cost. So that\u2019s where we feel the backlog sometimes unpredictable and with the majority of come from switch and AP. Madeline Brooks : Got it. Thanks so much. And just one follow-up question there, too. I just mentioned having a little bit of prudence for going into next year and just your guidance. I\u2019m also just wondering on the visibility side, are you seeing less visibility, the same visibility? Can you just talk to the trends that you\u2019re seeing there in your pipeline? Keith Jensen : I think the pipeline visibility is very good. And the pipeline growth is very strong. And I think that one of the things that we did at the end of the prepared remarks was, we went back to the 2022 mid-term guidance numbers that we gave, I think, a $10 billion booking company in 2025 and $8 million in revenue and margins of 25% or more and basically reiterated that. And I think we\u2019re doing that which requires a 22% CAGR from this point forward. We\u2019re doing that with the \u2013 after looking at our pipeline, looking at the strength of our pipeline so that it makes sense to us. Madeline Brooks : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Okay. Getting ready for our next caller. Our next caller is Keith Bachman at BMO. Keith, your line is open. Please go ahead. Keith Bachman : Many thanks. I also had two, Keith, to start with you. I wanted to go back to the billings commentary for Q4. Just on the revenue base is essentially the same, and therefore, it\u2019s a DR impact that you\u2019re guiding lower. As you mentioned that you\u2019re expecting backlog to be less than the $500 million and maybe for in change. Did some of that backlog, is it actually then flowing into the billings, and therefore, the billings guide down is even a little bit worse than it actually appears and any other context you could draw out on where specifically that billings weakness is Europe or what have you but if you could flesh those out, then I had a follow-up for Ken, please. Keith Jensen : Yes. I want to be clear, we are expecting backlog to actually increase from Q3 to Q4, not significantly, but slightly, so. Keith Bachman : Okay. So therefore, none of that backlog then is flowing into that billings in Q as anticipated, right? Keith Jensen : Correct. I mean you\u2019re always going to get some existing backlog that flows in the buildings, which you\u2019re going to get new backlog, net-net, it\u2019s going to be an add in total to it for the year. And I think the \u2013 and it\u2019s a good question about Europe. I don\u2019t want to \u2013 over that Europe form, you saw the revenue numbers and what we don\u2019t disclose it. I would say the billings numbers Europe performed very, very well in the quarter and their pipeline remains extremely strong as we go forward. Now we\u2019ll see as we get through and get closer to 2023, and I certainly would really agree that there are certain tailwinds that are appropriate for Europe. But to this point, they\u2019ve done it very, very well. Keith Bachman : Okay. Ken, for you, then it relates to that very directly relates. As we think about Europe in calendar year 2023, the currency, as you alluded to, is a headwind. So I was just in Europe and customers view that the prices since you price in dollars have actually gone up quite a bit. So is there a risk? Or how should we think about is there a risk of prices actually needing to come down because of the dollar-based pricing and therefore, the significant price increase, if you will, felt by the Europeans, is there a risk that prices need to come specifically down for currency next year? And/or would you see any risk more broadly, whether it\u2019s currency or otherwise, whereby because supply and demand is coming back into balance sometime during CY2023 that there is some risk rather than getting price increases that we might be in a situation where prices actually start to move lower? Ken Xie : I think first about our price policies really, we \u2013 when there\u2019s a cost increase like components another, we do like take some ourself. And then some others we probably have to pass the customer partner. But even with like price increase, we\u2019re still leading the industry on the price performance on the functionality service. So that\u2019s where so far we don\u2019t see \u2013 in the last year because of pricing and actually, we\u2019re keeping gaining market share because we have a leading price performance especially in a lot of what we call it convergence area and also like SD-WAN and OT is a very, very fast-growing area. So it\u2019s all our price advantage compared to competitors. And also, we do see a lot of potential to drive additional service because our service charge probably average about half of our some of competitor charging some are offer free, some are offer less, some are in sell as a bundle. So we do see a lot of potential growth area in the service, which also have a higher margin. Keith Bachman : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Just pulling up our next caller and it\u2019s Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Gregg, please go ahead. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. Keith, I know that you had experienced a bit of a pause in the first 10 days of June. With that in mind, how was linearity in the Q3 period? Were there any air pockets or anything that you would call out? Keith Jensen : Yes. I don\u2019t think \u2013 we didn\u2019t see anything like we saw good question. We didn\u2019t see anything like the two-week pause or10-day pause. We saw the first part of June in the Q3. I think that \u2013 when we look at linearity, you can see the DSOs, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good reflection of where we\u2019re at with linearity. It has not and probably will never be a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 business in terms of linearity. You\u2019re always going to get about 50% of your business in the final month of the quarter, but nothing really unusual about the activity there. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, we\u2019re getting quite a few questions about that billings guidance for the Q4. You outlined earlier to in response to Brad\u2019s question, the cash list that\u2019s sort of going into the Q4 guidance and the prudence with respect to the possibility for sales cycles to be elongated. I do just want to be fair, though, on that point. As it relates to the Q3 period and perhaps even the month of October, are you seeing any changes as it relates to average sales cycle? Ken Xie : We still have a very strong pipeline, actually stronger than before. And at the same time, we built pretty healthy, strong sales capacity to meet out the demand. Keith mentioned some tenure like we have about 50% of sales force actually has a tenure probably not reach the tenure yet, which we believe will become more productive in the next 6 months to 12 months, which also will helping drive the both the top line bottom line. Keith Jensen : And just so I don\u2019t if you can because I\u2019ve already done that. So tenure is up about 50% in the people. That as a \u2013 we didn\u2019t have a given a number, but it runs about 30% of the mix. So it\u2019s a significant number of people that we increased that are starting new to the organization. Gregg Moskowitz : And that will make sense. I\u2019m just wondering if there were any changes perhaps that you noticed that where might have been macro-related affecting sales cycles over the past 3 months to 4 months or so was as possible. It would just be very helpful to get a brief commentary on that as well. Thank you. Ken Xie : I just think that, as I said earlier in the conversation, as we started to see some \u2013 our deal size is getting larger in the enterprise, we\u2019re certainly subject to more inspection perhaps than the eight-figure deals are started much more inspection than the seven-figure deals worth. Gregg Moskowitz : Yes. Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : Standby for our next question. Adam Tindle at Raymond James is our next caller. Adam, your line is open. Please go ahead. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Keith, I wanted to start to appreciate that you gave a little bit of color on 2023 on services growth acceleration, obviously, an exciting catalyst I think the flip side of that is we\u2019re just kind of really unsure how to think about puts and takes to the other line item on product revenue growth. Not asking, obviously, for specific guidance, but I\u2019m thinking about these tough comps. You just had very strong growth in one of the toughest comps that you\u2019ve ever experienced in Q3. Your exit rate billings is \u2013 guidance is coming down. I think there\u2019s worry that the cancellation rates are at 4%, but could that ultimately increase with supply chain visibility. So a lot of fear on how bad product revenue growth could ultimately be and certainty on services revenue growth. So anything you could maybe point us to for a realistic view of how to think about puts and takes to product revenue growth in 2023. Ken Xie : Yes, kind of covering some old ground here. I don\u2019t mean that negatively. One, I would just \u2013 again, the fact that we reiterated the mid-term guidance which is a 22% CAGR is probably a good indicator of how we think about it. I think that investors and analysts and ourselves are trying to understand the timing of when the backlog is going to reverse and actually go to the income statement and have an impact from product revenue. And it\u2019s going to provide \u2013 when it does happen, I think it will provide some elevated product revenue numbers as we look forward to it. Yes, I don\u2019t have another point to that, and I kind of lost my train of thought. I apologize. Adam Tindle : Yes. The growth driver we feel has not changed, like the convergence, like all the consolidation, also elevate like a threat environment. That\u2019s how we\u2019re keeping driving the product growth. And also \u2013 the service also I think the product revenue is really the leading indicator of service revenue. So it\u2019s a pretty strong product revenue growth in the last two, three years we do see the service revenue continue to improve. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I would come back and just talk a little bit about the cancellation rate comment that concern, again, it has been remarkably consistent at 4%, not suggesting there\u2019s something there that would be a challenge. And certainly, I think the firewall part of that, which is roughly 1/3 is probably very specific to us and not really a commodity. There\u2019s other metrics provided in the past, and we can certainly kind of go through them again over 90% to 95% of all backlogs with existing customers. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s people coming off to Street trying to order from us because they\u2019re trying to double order or something like that. That\u2019s just not plausible about it. And of what\u2019s in backlog, I think, again, over 50% looking at Peter or not along with the \u2013 agrees with me, that\u2019s been partially delivered. So it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019re going to cancel something. So as a backlog got older, do we have more concerns about it. We watched aging a little bit. Yes, we did, but now we\u2019re starting to see a bit of a plateau here in terms of what the backlog increases are and certainly some easing around to be on the horizon around the supply chain environment. So while we do watch the cancellation rates very, very closely, we are not seeing indicators of concern there. Ken Xie : Yes. I think one other stat. I think I\u2019m recalling the numbers correctly, I have to look to stack up, but I think the top 20 deals in backlog accounts for like 8% of backlog. Peter Salkowski : Yes, that\u2019s what it was. Yes. Ken Xie : Yes. Adam Tindle : Got it. Maybe I can sneak in a quick follow-up. Just to get all the fear out there because aftermarket move suggests there\u2019s a lot of fear. On from a billings basis, you\u2019re mixing towards larger deals, which is obviously a good thing for the business, but your average contract term is flat at 29 months. A number of software companies are seeing durations decline in particular on those large multi-year deals. How do you think about potentially controlling for this so that duration doesn\u2019t become a headwind to billings growth? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think as we continue to \u2013 we\u2019ve said for several years that as we continue to expand into the enterprise segment, we expect that that\u2019s going to bring with the longer-term contracts. And it has shown that. If you go a couple of years, I think average contract rates were closer to 24 months or 25 months, and you\u2019re seeing that continued pressure. And I absolutely continue to believe that as we continue to have success expanding the enterprise, and that continues to be a larger part of our business, it will continue to put a bit of tailwind, if you will, on average contract term. I think also SD-WAN has shown to clearly be a longer-term contract that when customers come to the party. So we\u2019re not seeing that. I\u2019m happy to see the last few quarters that we\u2019ve kind of ended that 28%, 29% month and staying at that level. I was actually a little concerned that it was going to continue to grow and get into the low 30s. Adam Tindle : Thank you. Operator : Okay. We have our last question for the session. Michael Turits at KeyBanc. Your line is open, Michael. Michael Turits : Thanks. So to the extent you Ken, can you talk whether or not it seems realistic for backlog to continue to rise after this quarter? Or is that the point starts to go down, and at a fundamental level, where do you think we are relative to demand and, if you will, a refresh cycle around data centers that may have been neglected during COVID. Ken Xie : I have \u2013 probably were not using the refresh because I feel in the last like couple of years, some change in the network security landscape. So I probably more using the convergence, especially we see the strong growth SD-WAN, OT and also internal segmentation, other data center security which security is starting to deploy into the position traditionally network security, not deployed. So that\u2019s actually we plan most of the growth from that area. We do get into some big enterprise. They\u2019re also looking at how do the consolidation like whether networking security, working with the other part of the infrastructure there. And we also see the very, very strong growth for our business in the big enterprise there also. So that\u2019s probably not the times really deploying to the new area and not only the environment is very, very fast and also a lot of like working from home remotely but also a lot of new areas drive a lot of new deployment. So that\u2019s where probably we\u2019re not kind of looking at refresh, replacing some of the old network security device, but it\u2019s more in the new area we see will be \u2013 drive the growth for a very long time in the next 5 years to 10 years. Michael Turits : And Keith on backlog? Keith Jensen : I\u2019m sorry, backlog. Michael Turits : Yes. Keith Jensen : I think the last quarter and maybe I think the fourth quarter it would \u2013 the inference would be that we\u2019re at a plateau. Peter Salkowski : Still going to depend on supply, though, which is still the dynamic, but. Keith Jensen : Yes. Michael Turits : Thanks. Operator : Okay. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Peter Salkowski, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing remarks. Peter? Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Eric.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in the earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today's remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website. Ken and Keith's prepared remarks for today's earnings call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following the call. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken Xie. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding full-year and fourth quarter 2022 results. For the full-year, revenue growth accelerated to 33%. We continue to gain market share in the service security industry with customers increasingly recognizing how Fortinet integrate and a single platform approach to security delivers along total cost of ownership and a greater return on investment than competing solutions. Product revenue growth of 42% was very strong, making Fortinet a leading product revenue company in the cybersecurity industry with total product revenue of $1.8 billion. Our SD-WAN and OT bookings together accounted for over 25% of total bookings. And our goal is to keep growing and achieve #1 market share in network firewall Secure SD-WAN and OT security market over the next couple of years. For 20 years, Fortinet has made long-term strategies and investments around the convergence of networking and security. Yesterday, we announced our fifth-generation FortiSecurity processor, the FortiSP5. This new SoC base for the ASIC has secure computing power rating for major network security functions like Firewall to support 17x to 32x greater than the average of our competitor similar price model using general purpose CPUs and doubles the ASIC chip acceleration of applications to Forti such as New Trust, SASE, 5G and our SD-Branch with much better performance and efficiency. According to the most recent IDC data on unit shipment of firewall plants, Fortinet hold the #1 unit shipped market share position and 48%, providing Fortinet with an attractive economy of scale position us well as making it difficult for competitors to develop their own ASIC technology due to high entry barrier and significant investment that is required. Fortinet is a huge security computing power advanced advantages are able for the OS to integrate more security functions and applications than our competitors with much better performance and much lower energy consumption, resulting in a much lower total cost of ownership while offering easier operations for our customers. For example, a recent Forrester report highlighted that customers deploying Fortinet Secure SD-WAN solutions achieved a 300% return on investment over three years with a payback period of only eight months. Fortinet's substantial installed base of product with reach functions enable us to offer additional secure services, and upsell, integrated and automated for the Fabric Product Solutions. We recently announced several new and advanced services that help SoC team reduce their operations cyber-risk while being more efficient and handling cybersecurity issues. As networking and security continue to converge and consolidate, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2025 building target of $10 billion. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As we look back at 2022, we see the success of our strategy to lead in convergence and consolidation as well as the combined power of our ASIC technology with our integrated operating system. Combined, these efforts are driving our strong financial results. There's been an explosion of devices that must be connected to the cloud, data center and edge compute. As a result, the infrastructure has expanded to support secure connectivity via distributed firewalls, it is no longer feasible to overlay security on top of networking in the data center. They must be deployed as a converged solution. Firewalls need to work seamlessly with networking and security applications across the company's entire infrastructure. Fortinet is leading the convergence trend with a wide range of technologies, including network firewalls, Secure SD-WAN, 5G and OT security, all embedded in our single operating system delivered as hardware, software, cloud and as a service. Traditional CPU-based solutions are very inefficient as supporting both networking and security. That's why Fortinet developed proprietary ASIC technology to build an application-specific solution. Yesterday, as Ken mentioned, we announced our next-generation ASIC, the FortiSecurity processor or FortiSP5, which allows line speed convergence of networking and security at every network edge. The new seven nanometer technology combines existing NP7 technology with new content processor capabilities. Our enhanced platform suite of integrated products is delivering on customer demands for convergence, vendor consolidation, ease of management and lower operating costs. The success of this strategy is evident in our full-year 2022 results, and I'll start there. Billings passed the $5 billion mark, totaling $5.6 billion and growing 34%. While revenue totaled $4.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 32%, the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth of 20% or more. Driven by strong demand for our fabric and cloud security solutions, enhanced platform technology billings and revenue both increased over 40% to $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. And despite a challenging global supply chain environment, product revenue growth came in at 42%, our highest annual product revenue growth rate in over 10 years. Our product revenue growth was driven by the combined -- by the continued growth of our firewall use cases and the addition of over 23,000 new customers. Service revenue was up 26% to $2.6 billion, resulting in three consecutive years of accelerating service revenue growth rates. Gross margin was strong at 76.3% and operating margin outpaced our initial expectations, increasing 110 basis points to a new Fortinet record high of 27.3%. Our GAAP operating margin of 22% is one of the highest in the industry, and we continued our streak of being GAAP profitable every year of our 14-year history as a public company. Earnings per share increased 49% to $1.19. Free cash flow was a record at $1.45 billion. Free cash flow margin was 33% and adjusted for real estate investments, the free cash flow margin came in at 37%. And for the year, we repurchased approximately 36 million shares at a cost of $2 billion. Total deferred revenue increased 34% to $4.6 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 32% to $2.35 billion. Quarterly contract terms throughout the year were consistent with the year earlier periods, including the fourth quarter at 28 months. Before moving on to our Q4 results, I'd like to summarize our enterprise success and highlight a few seven figure deals from 2022. We saw great success during the year with our strategy to expand further into the large enterprise segment as the number of deals over $1 million increased over 55% to a record 546 deals and billings on these deals increased by over 70%. If we look at a few of our large deals of the year, let's start with the competitive upsell deal, Fortinet displaced a 11 different vendors by consolidating the customer's network to security functions on our Security Fabric. This worldwide wholesaler previously purchased secure SD-WAN and FortiProxy. Next on the list was a centralized network security solution that could be managed and deployed to its 400 global locations. This customer chose Fortinet Security Fabric for a selectable and integrated solution across multiple scenarios, including work from anywhere, perimeter security and data center segmentation. In another upsell deal, a leading global manufacturer was spun off and had to stand up the security and networking infrastructure separately. The newly created infrastructures included remote access, SD-WAN, application delivery control, authentication, endpoint, e-mail protection and switching. Keys to our win included our Zero Trust capabilities, a cloud-first SD-WAN strategy and the ease of integration and convergence across our platform suite. Lastly, in the new logo win, a large U.S. retailer with over 500 locations were struggling with a total cost of ownership of their legacy security architecture. Keys to this win included delivering a single pane of glass versus the multiple consoles they were using and replacing the competitors' firewalls with our FortiGate's, delivering URL filtering, WiFi security, and edge router replacement, all on our unified and integrated FortiOS platform. This customer reported anticipated savings of $29 million over five years. Turning to Q4 results, both billings and revenue delivered new Fortinet records with billings of $1.7 billion and revenue of $1.3 billion. Both metrics increased over 30%. The strong fourth quarter revenue performance reflects solid customer demand across both our core and enhanced platform technologies. In the fourth quarter, we added over 6,200 new logos, another new Fortinet record reflecting the support of our channel partners, the leverage they bring and the breadth of our worldwide customer base. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, billings growth of 32%, was driven by a 40% increase in enhanced platform technology billings, which accounted for over one-third of total billings. Total revenue growth of 33% was driven by a strong demand for core and enhanced technology platforms, which increased 26% and 47%, respectively. Product revenue grew 43% to $540 million. Service revenue was up 27% to $743 million, driven by strong product revenue growth and strength in our security subscriptions. Short-term deferred revenue grew 32% and represents eight consecutive quarters of accelerating growth rates. Total gross margin of 77.6% was driven by a 310 basis point increase in product gross margin to 65.2%. Several factors converged to drive our record high quarterly product gross margin, including legacy pricing actions, easing supply chain cost pressures and improved discounting. Service gross margin of 86.7%, ticked down 40 basis points due to increased labor cost and our expansion in cloud services and the related hosting costs. Operating margin of 32.5%, was up 400 basis points year-over-year due to the strong gross margin performance and FX benefit. Looking to the statement of cash flow summaries on Slides 11 and 12. Free cash flow was $497 million, adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments was $510 million, representing a 40% adjusted free cash flow margin. Cash taxes were $63 million, capital expenditures were $31 million, including $13 million for real estate investments. DSO increased 14 days sequentially and year-over-year to 89 days, also impacting service revenue growth. Moving to guidance. We believe the continued innovations we made in building our platform enables our customers' digital transformation journey. And as Ken noted, customers are increasingly recognizing how Fortinet is integrated and single platform approach to security can deliver a lower total cost of ownership and a greater return on investments than competing solutions. Now I'd like to review our outlook for 2023, summarized on Slide 15, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.415 billion to $1.465 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 24%. Revenue in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.220 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%; non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24%, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 150 basis points. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.29, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million, capital expenditures of $80 million to $110 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $20 million. And should also note that first quarter guidance assumes backlog decreases slightly during the quarter. For the full-year, we expect billings in the range of $6.710 billion to $6.790 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%. Revenue in the range of $5.370 billion to $5.430 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 22%. Total service revenue in the range of $3.335 billion to $3.365 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 27%, it implies a fourth consecutive year of accelerating service revenue growth. The service revenue guidance also implies product revenue growth of 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.39 to $1.41, which assumes a share count of between $805 million and $815 million. Capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million due to continued investments in clouds, data centers and facilities. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $375 million, split somewhat evenly between the first and second half of the year. The increase in cash taxes reflects recently effective R&D capitalization and amortization requirements. The full-year estimate assumes backlog approaches historical levels by the end of the year. Cybersecurity, but not immune to economic slowdowns is expected to remain a comparatively safe harbor. And with a strong business model and history of execution, we are confident that our market share gains will continue. We remain on track to achieve our 2025 financial targets, which include billings of $10 billion, revenue of $8 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25%, and adjusted free cash flow margin in the mid to high 30% range in 2025. And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Open up the call, please. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Essex of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. And congrats on some solid results and a solid guide. I guess given that we heard from one of your peers last night and they were I guess, markedly more conservative or cautious on the macro than you seem to be. Maybe for Ken and Keith, could you help us understand what you're seeing in the market from a macro perspective, how enterprises are spending. And how does any changes in the quarter relative to initial expectations pan out with regard to demand, we're seeing sales cycles. We're hearing about sales cycles elongating and budget scrutiny ongoing. What are you seeing on your side? Ken Xie : I took a question feedback from some customer partners. Their budget is tight, but Fortinet solution has a better cost of total cost ownership and also kind of even cost saving for some like a Secure SD-WAN solution. And at the same time, we do see -- the use case of firewall expanding much broader than before, especially for this OT security, some other area, which pretty much, I'd say, network security may be the only solution to secure some of this OT area. So that's where we see the demand is still pretty strong. And so we probably -- we're keeping gaining more market share in this well fragmented market. Keith Jensen : Yes. Thanks, Ken. I spot on with that. I would also add, look, I think we're all sensitive to the overhang from the macro environment and what that may mean is [indiscernible]. But when we look at our internal numbers, whether it's pipeline growth and even if we compare what pipeline growth is today versus a year-ago, it's even up in terms of percentage growth rates. The use cases, and I think in this environment, the savings that we offer and the ROI that we provide and some of the case studies that we provided in the call there are examples of that. I think we're continuing to benefit from that, and we do see that continued opportunities for market share gains even in this environment. Brian Essex : Got it. Maybe just for a quick follow-up then, Keith. As you think about the level of conservatism in your fiscal '23 guide, I mean, stronger than, I think some had expected. I know I'm going to get the question tomorrow how much conservatism is in there. What gives you confidence in hitting that kind of level of performance, particularly with regard to billings. And then any change to your 2025 targets as you kind of look at the strength that you're seeing in the market from here on out? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think that the approach that we take, if you will, is consistent this time around with what we've done in prior years, but with certainly added conservatism in it to reflect what's happening or what may happen with the macro environment. And first and foremost, we start with the pipeline and looking at the pipeline growth there and the kind of the timing of the pipeline and making sure that we have deals that are teed up for the middle of the year and perhaps even to the second half of the year. So there's ample opportunity there. You also want to make sure that you've got sales productivity numbers that make sense and sales capacity numbers that make sense. Yes, I think there will be some tailwind from the backlog, which I commented on in the comment that we're going to get some benefit from that as it continues to burn down. But keep in mind that we have seen some changes in cancellation rates, and I think we've added a significant amount of conservatism there around cancellation rates. Again, so I think it's really about the pipeline, it's the tailwind that we have and it take us the advantages that we're offering and total cost of ownership in this environment. Brian Essex : Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Keith, for you, just with respect to the services revenue guidance at 27%. That's not a material difference from the cadence you've been running at this year. And I'm curious what sort of input embed that revenue segment for you? And I ask because we have the dynamic of some of your customers delaying their subscription registrations over the course of '22. And then we also have the dynamic of a lot of your customers not having realized the pricing increases that you've expected in the last 12 to 18 months. So I'm curious as to why with those positive inputs, you -- we wouldn't see better services growth. And what sort of things that you're being conservative about there? And then a quick follow-up, please. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think it kind of goes back to Brian's question a moment ago in terms of -- with the level of conservatism and caution that's in the guide. And I know that historically, I've often complained that I don't get much room in the services line from where the consensus is versus what I'm forecasting. At a 27% number, I think that's pretty much right on top of what the street of that for the full-year. And I think in this macro environment, I think that's a great -- a good place for us to be at this point of the year for full-year guidance. Fatima Boolani : Understood. And any commentary on operating margin and operating profitability performance because we are seeing compression into next year, certainly on a quarterly basis. But anything to be mindful of there as it relates to maybe onetime items that are peeling out just perhaps why not see better follow-through in profitability? And that's it for me. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. Yes, I think our guidance is pretty much in sync with where we are historically at this point in time and consistent what we always talked about the 25% margin number. But I think the -- what you may be suggesting or inferring is really, it's all about FX, if you will, when you look at 2022 compared to 2023. We had a nice benefit from FX in 2022. And I think in terms of what our assumptions are for 2023, like the rest of people, we read the economic reports from the big banks and so forth and what the dollar is expected to do. And I think we've really pulled out a lot of that benefit by the end of this year. And so you're not really going to see that in the year-over-year comparison. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first for maybe a question for both Ken and Keith. Clearly, SD-WAN and OT are becoming a bigger part of the business and that too with higher growth rates. And so maybe the question is, how do you folks think about the growth rate or runway for growth in those two businesses either separately or together, over the next couple of years, as part of the total growth equation or part of the $10 billion goal, however you want to think about it, but really curious about that SD-WAN and OT part of the business that's been doing so well. Ken Xie : I think there is two parts. First, I totally agree with you said that SD-WAN and the OT market growing faster than the network security average. And on the other side, we do believe our solution has huge advantage compared to other competitors. So both SD-WAN, OT market is still pretty fragmented and compared to our home growth integrated solution and leverage for the ASIC company and power. So advantage much huge compared to other competitors, quite some mostly come from acquisition. And at the same time, they don't have the ASIC help to increase speed, lower the cost and the power consumption. So that's why we feel we're keeping growing above the market, so above the market growth rate. There's a different research about how the market is growing. But I do agree it's a fast-growing market compared to the cybersecurity space and there will be a lot of potential going forward. Saket Kalia : Got it. Got it. Very helpful. Keith, maybe just a quick follow-up for you. Actually, great to see the billings duration stay roughly similar. I'm curious if you could just talk anecdotally or just specifically just around how you're thinking about billings duration here in '23? And whether that's been something that you feel like customers have pushed on given the interest rate environment that we're in? Keith Jensen : Yes. I don't think that we've really seen customers push on the term. Obviously, at 28 months -- 28 months, which is kind of been keeping where we've been historically. But I do think in the fourth quarter, we certainly had conversations with customers that were I think perhaps even more focused on cash flow, if you will, than they were on discounting in terms of extended payment terms and that sort of thing. So if I were to look at the -- what I'm hearing back from customers, it was all about cash protection. And with that, I assume if I were trying to do a lot of five-year deals or something like that, I might have felt more pressure. But given the SMB mix of our business and our partner footprint, obviously, didn't come through in the numbers really. Saket Kalia : Yes, absolutely. Great to see. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hamza Fodderwala : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Good evening. Keith, I wanted to clarify something you said about the cancellation rates. I think you mentioned that you're seeing some changes there. Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit? I think like the past few quarters, it's been around 4%, 5%. Just if you could provide any more color on that comment? Keith Jensen : Yes. We did see a pickup to if we want to call it mid-single digits in Q3, we saw it tick up to high-single-digits in fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter. And we've anticipated this, particularly as the backlog starts to shift its mix as the firewalls. There's still a significant amount of firewalls in the backlog, but it really now has tilted towards the network equipment, the switches and the access points. And so as you would expect, one last comment on that, as we see the shift in the mix in the backlog as well as the pick-up in the cancellation rates, I would also offer that as part of the guidance setting process, I think we've taken a fairly conservative approach to cancellation rates on what they -- how they may impact 2023 or said another way, we're not expecting all the backlog that exists at the beginning of the year to convert in 2023 because we think there'll be some cancellations. Hamza Fodderwala : Got it. And just maybe a follow-up for Ken. I think SD-WAN is now nearly a $1 billion business for Fortinet which is quite remarkable because you just started selling it, I think, maybe four years ago. I'm curious as more of that base starts to come up for refresh. What are other monetization drivers do you see for SD-WAN, whether it be attaching more services or perhaps increasing the price points. I'm curious how you're thinking about that? Ken Xie : Definitely more service, whether under the overlay service for SD-WAN because our SD-WAN has all the security function and also a lot of -- deployed case whether supporting work from core from anywhere or kind of helping enterprise reduce their total cost of networking all these things. We do see a lot of additional service they need. At the same time, we also see the service provider starting more working together with us, offer some quite additional service beyond -- that's the traditional SD-WAN. So that's also helping drive much more service going forward. Hamza Fodderwala : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great, thank you very much and congratulations on just blow out results and guidance, a nice job. My first question is just around the new ASIC FortiSP5. Can you remind us what if any impact we might expect in terms of customer purchasing patterns and what you've seen in the past and the extent perhaps it can drive accelerated demand and/or maybe the risk of trade-down effect? And I've got a follow-up. Thanks. Ken Xie : Probably want to take some time, I'd say, maybe one to two years to refresh the product. And that's where every quarter, we tend to release one or two products, whether leverage new ASIC or the new CPU of Smarter network chip in the industry. I don't feel it will be a significant impact up and down of the result and will be more smooth transition. Because security deployment is a kind of a -- take long time to design, evaluate, deploy and also very, very long sales cycle. At the same time, the life cycle of the product also tend to be quite long, like seven to 10 years. So that's where the ASIC each generation definitely will help in and at the same time has a huge advantage compared to using general-purpose CPU. So that's where we're keeping gaining market share. But consider the switching costs, consider the long cycle, sales cycle and deployment cycle. And also, we also need time to put ASIC into a new product, which also taken in a few months, three to six months, thus I do see it will be like a more long-term positive impact instead of short-term. Keith Jensen : Yes, Brad, I would only offer again for context. I think that -- this is what Fortinet has been 20 generation. It's a chip probably now we think content processors and network processors and systems-on-a-chip. And I think that Fortinet, Ken and Michael have actually shown the ability to transition through those generations of chips. And if you look back at the financials, I think it's a little bit difficult to find a year that for a period of time, really saw spike because of the new chip. These are much more long-term plays. And I think the approach here is to execute in a smooth fashion over a number of years. Brad Zelnick : Thanks for the reminder and Keith, can you just expand on your comments around DSOs being up sequentially year-on-year and the impact of services revenue? And related to that, I recall you had a change in policy around subscription activations. Is that also impacting services revenue. Any help there would be great. Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes, the change in activation policies started February last week, I believe, February 1. So we'll start to see that going forward. What I was referring to is the -- is really all about linearity, right? That's what it gives you insights to. And if I see my DSO go from, call it, 75 days to 89 or 90, you can kind of start doing the math there and see that's a 20% increase in DSO, and it's really driven by how linearity came through in the quarter. And when linearity starts shifting that much, we lose the opportunity to gain service revenue from sales early in the quarter that would normally activate. So we really didn't get a lift in service revenue from in-quarter deals the way that we would have expected because of linearity. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal of Cowen. Your line is open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. And good afternoon and congrats on the great performance and guidance. Keith, given the slightly lower-than-expected 4Q service revenue, how should we be thinking about the first quarter service revenue growth? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think that we kind of remain truthful to or faithful to the notion of providing service revenue guidance for the full-year and kind of leave the Street work out the numbers from that point going forward. I think that certainly, as we kind of look at laying out the year and with the backdrop of the macro that we're all concerned about, I don't think we really wanted to push too hard on some of the metrics that we didn't need to push on. And I think where we ended up with is pretty consistent in the quarter with our consensus when we look at our internal allocations between product and service revenue. Shaul Eyal : Understood. And maybe one more. As we think about the non-GAAP operating margins and really great performance, should we be thinking of the target to be sort of an average of 25% over the period or a floor of 25% over the course of the next few years? Keith Jensen : I'm going to answer yes. Yes, you should be thinking about one of those two ways. Look, I think we're driven by being above 25% operating margin, right? I think the ones that -- the last few years have taught us is life full of surprises. And so locking into a fixed commitment is a little bit challenging sometimes. But clearly, we manage the business as if it's the floor. Shaul Eyal : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe for Ken or Keith, just on sales headcount. Obviously, you guys have been aggressively growing sales and marketing headcount in recent years, and it's nice to see the enterprise success you talked about. Just curious where we are in sales force productivity. And how we should think about sales headcount growth and even overall headcount growth in '23? And I have a follow-up. Ken Xie : Yes, we are continuing hiring. But at the same time, we want to keeping the efficiency and is not dropping the efficiency for the sales and marketing. And at the same time, there's some long-term investment, whether in R&D, the infrastructure supporting, we will continue to need to make. So that's why we do expect the total head count will keep it increased, but probably the rate that just like the last few years will be below the top line increase. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think just building Ken's comment one of the notes that we do track tenure. We talked about it last quarter. Tenure [ph] would be people that have been here for, say, people have been here more than six months. And I commented last quarter, the tenure was up, I think, eight points. It's actually moved back to historical norms now. And tenure is kind of a key component of productivity as we see -- as we go forward. Adam Borg : Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up just on the FortiGate and entry mid and high. It's nice to see really strong midrange growth is interesting at the high end leased by my math was the lowest mix since 2017. Just curious if anything to comment there. Thanks so much. Ken Xie : That sometimes depend on certain like products or backlog. I think that's probably the average still pretty similar. We don't see much, but sometimes from quarter-to-quarter, it may change a little bit. But I have to say the total mix is still pretty much the same. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think that's one of the challenges you have in the current environment and the supply chain was really doing funny things, if you will, into delivery, and we don't give you a lot of insights to orders that we were taking in, but we provide billings numbers, you get some distortion there just simply based upon what's available. Specifically, we saw a significant amount of availability of the 100F products, if you will, which are a midrange product. And you're seeing that availability came in the fourth quarter, and it shifted that mix in the way you just described it. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hello. Thank you. There's going to be one day call that no one is going to butcher my name, and I'm going to be very happy. But I wanted to ask you two things. First of all, could you provide a backlog for 4Q or anything about it? I'm trying to calculate the bookings for the year and what happens to bookings? And any color on backlog would be great. And the second question, a few people asked you about the services growth for next year. I want to ask you about the product growth. The product growth is going from 42% to 15%, if my math is right, from last year to next year to this year. And on the other hand, your commentary is positive. It's -- there's more activity, there's more product sales. So can you take us through the dynamics of product growth and also the connection, the relationship between services and products. Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes, I'll start with the last one first, if you will. I think that I think we are very excited about the opportunities in front of us in terms of how the company is executing. But we are certainly also very cognizant of the unknown of the macro environment. And I think there's just an opportunity here in terms of how we guide for the full-year to really bake in concerns around the macro and how it may manifest in the coming months -- coming quarters. So I think you're seeing that, and I kind of made a comment earlier that historically, it's been tough for me to be somewhat cautious on service revenue because it's so visible. We're looking at short-term deferred revenue and the conservatism oftentimes ends up in product revenue. I think there's still an element of that in this conversation. Ken Xie : Yes, I think for the backlog like what I said in the last one or two quarter, it's continued shifting to the network area, network and the Wi-Fi which is more industry standard product. I'd say probably today, most of the backlog will come from the network side and the Wi-Fi side, which has a higher cancellation rate. And -- so that's where like Keith has mentioned, we take a pretty, when it's positive conservative, but that definitely pretty good estimate what will the impact for the whole year on all these -- the backlog for the product revenue. And product revenue, definitely, we see probably going forward, the benefit of the new ASIC and also some of the new products that were helping and also some of the case, the use case -- additional use case of the firewall definitely also are helping, but it will take some time. So that's where we tend to be more careful to forecast. At the same time, we do see long-term, we still have a huge advantage compared to other competitors because the investment we made in the product, in the hardware, in ASIC give us huge advantage of the total cost of ownership towards container keeping gaining market share in that space. Tal Liani : And do you provide some numbers about the backlog or maybe how material it is to revenues as a percentage of revenues? Ken Xie : I think it's -- since it's been a large difficult to forecast at the same time, with the change in cancellation and also most of the backlog related to networking WiFi not a core product. So that's where, since last quarter, we no longer provide detail of the backlog, we feel that could be a little bit misleading if we keep in providing that. Keith Jensen : I think we can add over some directional comments here with it. So the headlines would be that backlog was up year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter it was down. But as you start thinking through how to treat the backlog in terms of doing your own models going forward, again, we would come back and remind you of a couple of things. We expect the cancellation rates are going to increase, and that's baked into our guidance, as we look at things. And when we say return to historical norms in the commentary, I think we probably would have three years ago had backlog for professional services and training that may have been in the $30 million range. So maybe with growth now you're probably looking at a steady state that could get you over $40 million to $50 million. So just a note of caution, they'll just take all that backlog and assume it's all going to convert into billings and revenue in 2023 given those dynamics. Tal Liani : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Hey guys. Nice quarter. Keith, I was wondering if you could do a little bit of a deeper dive for us into the enhanced part of your business, if there's a way for you to kind of break it down a little bit for us by product. And perhaps rank order for us, categories which are growing above the average for the category and below the average for the category. I would just like to get a little bit more color as to the change in mix within that? Keith Jensen : Yes. I don't know that I've really seen a change in the mix, if you will. I think the -- when you look at the -- what we call the FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer. And certainly, the virtual machines are doing very, very well. And then as you start looking at the tail of the fabric products in the -- on the areas of EDR and monitor and SIM and so on and so forth, I think that they're smaller dollar totals, but sometimes very dramatic and exciting growth rates. So I want to be a little bit careful about getting -- painting anybody in too great a light in terms of their contribution because everybody is contributing. Certainly, the networking equipment part of the business has done very, very well, and this is a key component of this convergent story that we've talked about, and it remains probably about one-third of the fabric business. Ittai Kidron : Got it. Excellent. And then just going back to the cancellation rate, just to make sure I understand this. How much of this is tied into supply chain, meaning of supply chain? Is it getting better availability is no longer an issue? Customers are less perhaps interested in getting too far ahead in line and waiting for product. How much of that is a factor in this? Ken Xie : The supply chain environment definitely have some improvement for networking for the WiFi. That's where sometimes a customer, they may have a multiple order to see which vendor can deliver because a lot of networking equipment WiFi is a pretty standard product. Even for us, we do add quite some security functions in there. But at sometimes customers just cannot wait. So that's where we see a little bit higher cancellation rate with -- I think right now, the overall supply chain environment, I think is improving. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the conversation around cancellation rates, a few things there. We said it went from mid single-digits to high single-digits. And then as we built into the guidance, it is a multiple that we built in the guidance of what we just saw in the fourth quarter. What we actually get out of it, we'll see. But the reason to be so cautious about it is what Ken is talking about. We knew that we had an advantage with firewalls and dealing with our suppliers and our vendors and we thought we'd be successful in pushing down that component of backlog first. And indeed, the mix has shown that. I think it's now something on the order of about 75%, 25% between networking equipment and firewalls still firewalls in the mix. But as Ken pointing out is there may be more risk with that networking equipment of cancellations as we go forward, and particularly its a backlog deal for those elements continue to age out a little bit as we move through this process. In terms of continuing supply chain challenges, I'm not quite sure I was making the length on that. I don't -- I guess that would have an impact on the continuing to build of backlog. But as we said in our comments, we really expect to get to a backlog number by the end of this year that's much more closely aligned with our historical norms. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Thanks. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Okay. Thank you. Just two quick questions. First, I want to ask a question on EMEA. You've had five quarters now of accelerating growth in Europe, and that seems to defy the macro trends that we consistently hear about in Europe. Just wondering if there's something specific in your portfolio that might be driving that strong growth in Europe? Ken Xie : I think we definitely have a pretty long tenure and a good team there. And at the same time, the case, the firewall case also expand quite well in Europe, in some countries there. And some of the service provider carrier, they are a little bit more ahead compared to some bigger service provider were the U.S. on moving some new solutions, including some 5G SD-WAN. So that's where we continue to see some good growth there. Also, we kind of surprisingly even during the recession, the SMB sector growing quite strong compared to some enterprise. Enterprise more about how to lower the cost ownership, protect some of their own kind of profit margin. But SMB, they do see the importance of cyber security, especially in retina were they are starting more targeted SMB right now. So we do see quite strong growth in SMB and so that's also helping some regions in Europe. Andrew Nowinski : Got it. Okay. And then I wanted to ask about gross margins. So you talked about easing cost pressures and lower discounting as some of the levers that drove that better-than-expected gross margin. I guess, number one, how sustainable do you think those factors are as we look into fiscal '23? And then when you launched new ASIC, like you did earlier today, is that a headwind to gross margin initially? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think a few things we talked about price benefits, the discounting and then some easing of the impact of the supply chain. I think the price benefit is something that will obviously stay with us in the future. And so we should still get a tailwind from that. However, discounting and supply chains, call it, savings for lack of a better term, that's what we relate to our history of price increases. And I think we kind of reached a very kind of maybe the high watermark in terms of being -- having price increases covering those costs, and that will start to settle back down to a more normalized pattern going forward. Meaning that we'll still have inflationary cost increases, but we've really slowed down the price benefits, the price increases. So net-net, price increases continue, discounting and supply chain benefits may not. Andrew Nowinski : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Raymond McDonough of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Raymond McDonough : Hi, thanks. Maybe for Ken or Keith. The last time we saw product growth accelerate for two years was back in 2014 and '15, you had two really strong years of product growth, and that was followed by a pretty sharp deceleration of growth over the next two years. And I understand the business is a lot different than it was back then, but there does seem to be some similarities, at least how it relates to the macro environment and your results obviously point to you guys navigating it, the macro quite well. But you did reiterate your '25 guidance, which I believe implies mid-teens product growth. So I guess the question is, why should we think this time is different? Is it just that you have a significantly larger portfolio of solutions? Is it broader acceptance from customers willing to consolidate networking and security functionality. Any comparisons or contrast you can provide specifically as it relates to product growth versus, if you will, the previous cycle would be helpful. Ken Xie : I think in the 2014, 2015 last the outbreak of a weather target so many case, which a lot of enterprise tried to upgrade from the traditional connection-based firewall to the next-gen firewall, which including some prevention and other things. So that's where it's more like kind of refresh more in the enterprise area. So we do see some strong growth there after the severe issue. And then by this time, we see there's a few things. One is really during the pandemic, there's a new infrastructure build supporting a homework anywhere. At the same time, the ransomware attack quite broadly hit the whole industry. And another part, we keep on seeing the convergence, which is like SD-WAN, the 5G, the WiFi and also internal segmentation. So that's a much broader used case of the firewall deployment and also including OPG, a lot of more devices being connected. So we feel this time it is really kind of a more broad firewall used case kind of apply to the whole infrastructure. That's what we kind of more emphasized the convergence is a little bit different than the last time it's like eight, nine years ago. So that's why we feel this time probably will be more smooth transition because the traditional firewall, whatever will not go away. And at the same time, that's more used case convergence into the traditional networking area, expanding to the OT some other area, we're helping keeping driving the product revenue growth and then followed by the additional service revenue. So that's the chance we're planning. Raymond McDonough : That's helpful. And if I could, maybe a follow-up. You talked a little bit about the momentum in large deals and enterprise deals in '22. But given the macro environment, could you compare and contrast maybe Keith or Ken behavior you're seeing from larger customers and maybe those on the smaller end of the spectrum. Are you seeing more deal delays upmarket, more propensity to consolidate functionality at the lower end? Anything -- any more color would be helpful. Ken Xie : Yes, it's definitely helping the customer lower the total cost of ownership, both on the management cost and also on the product service cost, which we have here an advantage over the competitors. So that's where we see a lot of a big enterprise customers. They definitely want to -- when they see the renewal, when they see all this -- need to add additional protection for the infrastructure, we do see this like how to have a better total cost of ownership and at the same time, leverage a single integrated platform, automated platform to offer better security networking together. Even there's a trend to merge the traditional network operating team and security operating team together to making the stock and not kind of combined together and also converge on the traditional networking and security together. So we do see some trends happening in the big enterprise and which we kind of developed technology and the long-term investments starting to see. I mean, stating benefit for the trend. Keith Jensen : Great. Raymond McDonough : Yes, go ahead. Keith Jensen : Like everybody else, I mean, you're reading about people talking about deals taking longer to get across the finish line and more approvals and so forth. And I don't think we were immune to that by any stretch of the imagination. Keep in mind as we're going through as the world is moving through this. At the same time, Fortinet's kind of expanding from just seven figure deals. And I think we talked about 546 seven figure deals or more last year, if I remember correctly, a huge number. Now adding more and more eight figure deals. So I think we're probably seeing huge opportunities, but we're also getting exposed to how that approval process works and how we manage with our sales team, our customers through that process. Raymond McDonough : Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the strong results. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Keith, I wanted to start with pricing. I think we picked up if we got this right, another pricing increase announced in January effective in February. Wondering if you could touch on the rationale and early response to that -- where are we in the elasticity of demand? And thinking forward, obviously, costs are ultimately going to normalize, hopefully, in your model. What would be the strategy for you once costs normalize, would you reduce price or capture margin? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes, on that part first. I mean I think we'll continue to monitor the market and make the appropriate adjustments there. I don't seeing inflation go backwards it's probably not something that's happened a lot in history, but it could happen, I guess. In terms of the most recent price increase that we talked about, it's almost a non-event to me. It's extremely low single-digits growth and after discounting, it's a fraction of an interest point. Adam Tindle : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up for Ken. I wanted to ask on SASE competition. When your main competitors has said they've integrated their SASE offering with SD-WAN and Secure Web Gateway in particular. They're pushing that sales motion across the entire sales force now. As we think about Fortinet, obviously, very strong in SD-WAN, but that Secure Web Gateway or proxy piece is perhaps not as prevalent or a different strategy. It's clearly not impacting your unit market share at present, but just thinking forward to competing and differentiating in SASE now that your competitor really pushing that motion across the entire sales force? Thank you. Ken Xie : Yes, I think we -- our strategy, like [indiscernible] seeing in the last few years is; first, we want to have a SASE or integrated in the same system, the same OS, including all the SD-WAN or the SASE function. So making SASE can be more easily broader deploy and also working with service provider to leverage their infrastructure to offer a SASE. So it's a little bit different than some of the SASE players right now in the market. So we do believe this is highly integrated the single system as will be more efficient and same time will be more secure. And so that's what we're keeping building and whether the new FortiASIC [indiscernible] and also the new FortiOS reflect all this kind of development we reported into the solution. At the same time, we're keeping working closely with pretty much all the carrier service provider, even cloud provider to offer SASE together. And that's also a little bit different strategy compared to some other SASE player. So we do believe long-term leverage infrastructure, a lot of our own service provider telecom provider had will be much more efficient than the profit model compared to some of the SASE solution or player kind of losing money, which will be difficult to last long. So that's what we will keeping invest in this area. And also, we want to be a long-term player in this space and also we'll be keeping internal innovation R&D and keeping driving this space. Adam Tindle : Very helpful. Thanks and congrats on the year. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Could you share a little bit of what is happening with respect to the cloud infrastructure build-out. Tell us a little bit about what you're doing, where you are in the progress and customer response thus far? And then I had a follow-up on the networking category. Ken Xie : Yes. We continue keeping building of the infrastructure, including the cloud. Also our strategy a little bit different than 100 players we tend to build out ourselves just like we -- you can see the investment in some of the real estate. Quite some of that also go to the -- like a data center infrastructure that give us much better cost and also more long-term benefit just like how we -- the investment made in early real estate kind of benefit our office cost, rental costs. So that's where we're using the cost saving we get from this rental keeping invest into some more long-term infrastructure real estate. We do see that we're keeping benefit the company a long time. But at the same time, like I said, also partner working with car service providers that's other strategy we have managed some of their infrastructure. So that's also make a win-win both party or benefit or will be profit. That's also the strategy we have. Ben Bollin : And within that, Ken, could you speak to, is this -- is it purely cost is latency part of the narrative? Is it being closer to your customers? What's the broader strategy within it? Ken Xie : Not just, but also will make it easy to manage easy to scale. Even some of the SASE solution I had to be the some bigger customers, they may even do themselves. So if you can integrate a more successive function to the same or into the same system. So that's sort of the long-term strategy we have and also working with service providers is very, very important for us. Ben Bollin : And then my last one. Ken, what are your thoughts on the traditional campus networking opportunity in the WLAN market? How do you think about wallet share opportunity and the ability to displace more of the incumbent there? That's it for me. Thank you. Ken Xie : That's kind of the thinking we have like over 20, 30 years really. There's a convergence of networking, traditional networking and network security. I think SD-WAN is a very, very good example. So the WAF solution will be more efficient, more secure, and there's a lot of additional service we can apply to secure SD-WAN, which is whether offer free or we are not kind of there yet. But same thing for a lot of other web technology. And so we feel that's a huge potential. And -- but also doing security in the networking environment not need a huge company in power, which has come from ASIC investment we made, which also will take a long time to see the return of investment, that's what we kind of comment from day one back 23 years ago. So when we start with we really need to invest and planning all these kind of long-term convergence of networking or security together. So the new ASIC is one example is the fifth generation of our SoC chip, which also including some of the investments we made in the mine generation of our content process and seven-generation network processor together with a lot of multiple CPU. So we continue to develop technology and eventually will be deployed more broadly beyond the traditional network security. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter Salkowski for any closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Valerie. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call.

Ken and Keith's prepared remarks for today's earnings call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following today's call. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding first quarter 2023 results. For the first quarter, revenue growth was 32% due to strong growth in both product and service revenue. With 35% product revenue growth, we continue to gain market share while being a leading product revenue company in the cyber security industry. This strong product revenue growth will help drive future service revenue growth. Quarterly service revenue grew over 30% for the first time in six years. We believe we have a significant opportunity to upsell value-added security services to our large installed base. In the first quarter, SD-WAN and OT bookings together continued to account for over 25% of total bookings, and our goal is to become the 1 in Network firewall, Secure SD-WAN, and OT security markets over the next couple of years. Fortinet is leading the trend of network and security convergence and cyber security consolidation. Gartner expects that by the year 2030 the secure networking market will be larger than traditional networking. Traditional networking lacks awareness and control of content, applications, users, devices, and location and is still using the same network protocol that was developed 50 years ago. Fortinet\u2019s secure networking solution has expanded from Next Generation Firewalls to SD-WAN, SD-Branch, 5G, internal segmentation, ZTNA and Universal SASE, and we believe, the secure networking market can achieve double-digit growth annually for the foreseeable future. In today\u2019s environment, organizations are looking to consolidate their multiple security vendors and functions that are deployed across their expanding attack surface to lower their TCO and management costs while improving visibility and automating real time threat detection and response. Fortinet\u2019s latest release of FortiOS 7.4 together with the FortiSP5 ASIC leads the industry with better integration and automation as well as faster acceleration while lowering total cost ownership. FortiOS enables organizations to deploy the Fortinet Security Fabric to every edge, allowing security to dynamically scale and adapt as the network evolves. Last month, we announced Universal SASE, which supports hybrid infrastructure and enables the same networking and security features that are available in our appliances to be delivered as-a-service, all within a single console. Many of our service provider partners are collaborating with us on this offering. Also, we announced enhancements to several of our Fortinet Security Fabric solutions, including endpoint security, cloud security, SoC, and SOAR. As networking and security continue to converge and customers looking to consolidate vendors and point products, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2025 billings target of $10 billion while generating an annual non-GAAP operating margin of at least 25% for each of the next three years. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon everyone. Let\u2019s start with the key highlights from our strong first quarter performance. Our strong first quarter results reflect a continued demand for our broad portfolio of cybersecurity and networking solutions and the demand for consolidation and convergence that is delivered by our integrated, single platform strategy. Total revenue growth of 32% was led by strong product revenue growth and service revenue growth accelerating to over 30%. Billings increased 30%, our eighth consecutive quarter of at least 30% billings growth. Secure SD-WAN and OT bookings once again accounted for over 25% of total bookings. Our strong top-line results reflect continued customer demand across both Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies, and highlights the diversification of our business model by solutions, geographies, customer segments, and industry verticals. We continued to deliver balanced growth and profitability with better than industry average top-line growth and strong profitability despite the continued economic uncertainty. The first quarter operating margin of 26.5% represents the highest first quarter operating margin in our 14-year history as a publicly traded company. Free cash flow was $647 million, representing a margin of 51%, up 23 percentage points. Both the quarterly free cash flow and free cash flow margin are Fortinet post-IPO records. Last month we hosted nearly 3,000 customers and partners at our very successful Accelerate Conference and I\u2019d like to recap three key themes : one the expanding firewall deployments environment; two, convergence; and three, consolidation. So starting first, today's rapidly evolving threat landscape and connectivity demands a comprehensive approach to firewalls and network security, including a combination of hardware, virtualized software, and security services. In fact, Gartner anticipates that by 2026, more than 60 percent of organizations will have more than one type of firewall deployment, which will prompt adoption of hybrid mesh firewalls. Fortinet is well-positioned to capitalize on this expansion of firewall deployments and form factors as we have been delivering hybrid mesh firewalls for years on a single operating system. Second, the company was founded over 20 years ago on the belief that the convergence of security and networking will become an industry standard. Gartner shares this belief noting they expect the size of the secure networking market to overtake the traditional networking market by 2030. We believe secure networking at scale works most effectively on ASIC technologies. Since its inception Fortinet has been developing proprietary ASIC technologies to build application-specific solutions to support convergence as traditional CPU-based solutions are less efficient at supporting both networking and security. Third, vendor and product functionality consolidation strategies continue to become more commonplace. Looking to Gartner here again, they note 75% of organizations are pursuing a cybersecurity vendor consolidation strategy in 2022, up from 29% in 2020. Our integrated FortiOS platform allows customers to converge networking functionality with security capabilities, while consolidating cybersecurity products and functionality. With FortiASIC\u2019s significant computing power advantage, FortiOS can consolidate more security functions and solutions while maintaining our performance and cost advantage. Specifically, FortiOS supports many security applications, including network firewall, SD-WAN, SASE, 5G, WiFi security, ZTNA, VPN, and SSL with a variety of use cases for each security application. For example, firewall use cases include data center, branches, edges, virtual, cloud native, micro-segmentation, both East/West and North/South and firewall-as-a-service. Our convergence and consolidation strategy provides security across our customers\u2019 entire digital infrastructure, while lowering their operating costs. Now let\u2019s now take a closer look at the first quarter. Billings grew 30% to $1.5 billion, driven by Enhanced Platform Technology solutions. In terms of industry verticals, government and financial services top the list as a percentage of total billings, with financial services up over 40%. Construction, media, and utilities were all up at least 50%. Billings growth benefited from a better-than-expected backlog contribution. While the backlog cancellation rate increased quarter-over-quarter, it was lower than we had forecasted in our model. We continue to believe there is an elevated cancellation risk in future periods for networking equipment backlog. Bookings grew double digits in the quarter, off a challenging comparison of 50% growth in the first quarter of last year. We continue to see success with our strategy to expand further into the large enterprise segment with the number of deals over $1 million increasing 38% to 124 deals and billings on these deals increasing 50%. One of these deals was an 8-figure expansion and upsell opportunity at a Fortune 50 retailer. The retailer was looking to replace their firewall point solutions with a holistic cybersecurity solution. After purchasing FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer in the fourth quarter of last year, this customer selected FortiGate VMs after a very competitive process for their 2,000 store locations as part of our new FortiFlex program. FortiFlex is a new points-based consumption program supporting hybrid mesh firewall deployments as well as a variety of other security solutions. The customer selected Fortinet due to the substantial value offered by our unified platform and their significant technical requirements. In the first quarter, we added approximately 6,100 new logos \u2013 reflecting the support of our channel partners through their investments and the investments we\u2019ve made in them. Average contract term was flat year-over-year at 27 months and down 1 month quarter-over-quarter. Turning now to revenue, total revenue grew 32% to $1.26 billion, driven by strong demand for Core and Enhanced Platform Technologies, increasing 23% and 50%, respectively. Product revenue of $501 million increased 35%, despite the very difficult comparison to last year\u2019s first quarter at 54% with its very strong contribution from acquisitions. Product revenue growth was driven by strong growth in Enhanced Platform Technologies, improving supply chain dynamics, and our earlier pricing actions. Service revenue was up over 30% to $762 million, the highest growth rate in services since 2016. The average number of days between when a customer purchases and subsequently activates a security service contract declined slightly sequentially and remained elevated on a year-over-year basis. Service revenue growth was closely aligned with our short-term deferred revenue growth rate in recent periods. Short-term deferred revenue growth was over 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Total gross margin of 76.3% was up 190 basis points including a 440 basis point increase in product gross margin to 61.8%. Product gross margins benefited from earlier pricing actions, improved discounting, and easing cost pressures. Service gross margin of 85.9% ticked up 70 basis points as price increases offset increased investments in data centers and Points of Presence, or PoPs. Operating margin of 26.5% was up 450 basis points due to the strong gross margin performance, a foreign exchange benefit, and revenue growth that was 10 points higher than our 22% headcount growth. As previously noted, 26.5% is our highest ever first quarter operating margin as a public company. Looking to the Statement of Cash Flows summarized on Slides 7 and 8, free cash flow was a quarterly Fortinet record at $647 million and benefited from elevated receivables in the fourth quarter of last year and the subsequent cash collections, as well as the record-setting operating margin, and the timing of CapEx projects. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes the real estate investments, was $662 million, representing a 52% adjusted free cash flow margin and our highest margin since our 2009 IPO. We have come to expect some quarterly variances in our free cash flow results with the first quarter often stronger due to the seasonally stronger fourth quarter billings. Capital expenditures were $30 million, including $15 million of real estate investments. This was lower than expected due to the timing of real estate activities. Cash taxes were $21 million. The Board increased the Company\u2019s share repurchase authorization by $1 billion, and the total available share buyback authorization is now approximately $1.5 billion for repurchases through February 2024. Looking forward, we are excited about the growth drivers that we have discussed previously as well as our new single-vendor Universal SASE offering. Our Universal SASE offering delivers a comprehensive solution that extends the convergence of networking and security from the edge to remote users while helping teams drive operational efficiency and reducing complexity and costs by consolidating vendors. In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2025, one-third of new SASE deployments will be based on a single-vendor SASE offering, up from 10% in 2022. As we bring Universal SASE to market, we expect to make various investments including increasing our PoPs. Our guidance reflects the impact of these investments to both our gross margin and capital expenditure estimates. Moving to guidance, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the second quarter and full year summarized on Slides 10 and 11, which is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1 billion 560 million to $1 billion 600 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%, revenue in the range of $1 billion 280 million to $1 billion $320 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.35, which assumes a share count of between 790 million and 800 million, capital expenditures of $80 million to $110 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $35 million, which is lower than our prior expectation as the deadline for certain tax payments has been extended to the fourth quarter. The second quarter guidance assumes backlog decreases during the quarter. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6 billion 750 million to $6 billion 810 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 21%. This guidance assumes a low-single digit impact on billings growth from backlog. Revenue in the range of $5 billion 425 million to $5 billion 485 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 23.5%, service revenue in the range of $3 billion $370 million to $3 billion $400 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 28%. The service revenue guidance implies product revenue growth of 16%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75% to 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 to $1.48, which assumes a share count of between 795 and 805 million, Capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million due to the continued cloud, data center, and facilities investments. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $390 million with approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. The full year estimates assume backlog returns to historical levels later this year. As we wrap up the prepared remarks, maybe one additional observation. Over many years the Fortinet team and its partners have offered a very solid and consistent level of execution across a wide range of economic cycles and other challenges. Like many others, we see a level of economic uncertainty in front of us and we look forward to this possible challenge in delivering on our goals. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Peter Salkowski : Thank you. As a reminder, during the Q&A session we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one followup question to allow others to participate. Chris, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Essex from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter particularly in a tough macro. Maybe Keith for you, nice acceleration in services revenue this quarter, and I know Ken talked about more effectively selling or selling value added services, secure services into your install base. How much was due to that better attach rate of secure services versus changes in registration policy or pricing increases in the quarter? Keith Jensen : FortiGuard,: By that I mean, the customer did register a little bit faster in the first quarter, but that lag or that registration policy change that we implemented in the first quarter, I would specifically call out is not really having an impact in the first quarter, nor did we really expect one. So kind of in order, I think it was selling into the install base price increases and then some light improvements in the registration behavior. FortiGuard: By that I mean, the customer did register a little bit faster in the first quarter, but that lag or that registration policy change that we implemented in the first quarter, I would specifically call out is not really having an impact in the first quarter, nor did we really expect one. So kind of in order, I think it was selling into the install base price increases and then some light improvements in the registration behavior. Pay-As-You-Go: By that I mean, the customer did register a little bit faster in the first quarter, but that lag or that registration policy change that we implemented in the first quarter, I would specifically call out is not really having an impact in the first quarter, nor did we really expect one. So kind of in order, I think it was selling into the install base price increases and then some light improvements in the registration behavior. Ken Xie : Yes, also with the new FortiOS 7.4 that started launching, we started to have a more function. We can also enable much more new service going forward for both the current customer installation base and also for new customers. Brian Essex : Got it. That's helpful. Maybe as a follow up piece, I think you commented on lower than expected cancellation rate. I know the question will be asked, impact on billings from backlog training and what some of your assumptions are, particularly given what you see in the macro? I know you talked about you expect to be at normalized rates for backlog by the end of the year, but maybe if you could contextualize or quantify that to the extent that you're able to? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think in the guidance particularly as we look at the full year, it's kind of difficult to figure out exactly which quarter some of that backlog is going to end up in or be canceled. But for the full year, I think we talked about low single digit growth that would be coming from the backlog. I do think that the risk to cancellations increases as the year progresses, and by that I mean if a customer has only been in backlog for a week or a month or something like that, there seems somewhat less probability that they're going to cancel. But the longer it takes to deliver on that backlog, I think the cancellation risk continues to increase. Ken Xie : Also a point is very, you mentioned go back normal end of the year, we see later this year. It could be middle, could be towards the end, but in Q1 I'd say the operation team did a great job to reduce the backlog, which is also helping secure more customer and unload some cancellation rate. Brian Essex : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you both very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Gabriela Borges : Good afternoon. Thank you. I have one for Ken or for Keith, it's a followup question on forecasting, which is, we've heard so much noise in the industry around supply chain and COVID catalyst product cycles. How do you all think about true demand and potentially planner and the risk of demand going faster than expected, given you've had a very strong couple of years? Thank you. Ken Xie : I think probably some of them will refer to the traditional network security, secure some enterprise, deployment enterprise, but we do see that our solution has a much broader use case and also expand much bigger market opportunities than the traditional enterprise firewall. And also the IT/OT is also see one of our strong growth, continue to helping drive both the new customer and also expanding the current existing customer. Also in the ICE and B [ph] space is a relatively greenfield. We also see pretty healthy faster growth probably even faster than the traditional enterprise, which is more replacement. I think all this I see contributing to pretty healthy, I keep saying double digit growth in the future for the whole security space. Gabriela Borges : Yes, that, that makes sense. Thank you. And Ken the followup is for you, which is, as you start to execute more on the convergence of selling into the networking budget or the convergence of networking plus security, when you look at the classic networking competitors, how do you think about the barrier or the limitation for classic networking vendors to get more into security and become more competitive in the convergence over time? Ken Xie : I would say from the quality architecture it's very different because security needs much more complete power and to handle the lot of unstructured data, which the traditional networking company, probably more based on some structured data handle, some fixed mix protocol and much less company power needed to process data compared with the network security. So that's where, and also we would have to implement the function and new function come up every year in the software first and then keep enhancing, improving performance leverage ASIC and that's also, we don't see networking company doing some of that. They probably maybe bit slow on where to come up the new function for the security space, all kind of have a different architecture to really supporting the secure computing needed for now security. So that's -- so far, have not seen the traditional networking company really come close. May be they did some acquisition, but so far I don't see they really come up too much since -- to meet a new demand from customer both on the function and also on the service, on the infrastructure change. Gabriela Borges : Thanks for the detail. Congrats on the quarter. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking my questions. Ken just a technology vision question for you. You are very, and the team is very bullish on the SASE opportunity that was very apparent at the Accelerate conference as well. But I'm curious as to why you're taking the effort to build out data centers and points of presence to deliver your universal SASE strategy versus maybe some of your peers and competitors who are maybe relying on third party providers and hyperscalers? And then I have a quick follow up, please. Ken Xie : Yes. First of all, SASE kind of a vision is little bit different than some of competitors. We do believe need to be universal, need to be more broadly deployed and also more leveraged, a lot of service provider infrastructure. It's kind of a hybrid environment inside of a cloud only SASE solution. And we do keep on expanding some of our path because there's a, definitely, there's some user like whether depend on working from home as a mother or SASE to secure some of their traffic here. But on other side, there's a huge base of customer need to using SASE, our kind of service model, leverage both service provider out their current infrastructure and even onsite appliance. And so that's where in certain point we also see our FortiSwitch and FortiAP are kind of have a agent to helping for the traffic for the Forti [indiscernible] to process all this SASE traffic there. So that's where, that's the reason we kind of put SASE in a single OS, both on the networking side of function like [indiscernible] brand strategy and other plus the security like a CASB DLP, [indiscernible] service, all these things. So that's where we have a more integrated, more broadly distributed and leverage whatever the hyper infrastructure size solution there. That's also the reason we continue to build some other PoP. It's a little bit different than some other leverage certain cloud provider because we do see the cloud provider potentially also can be the service provider to offer SASE and also from the [indiscernible] I point of view even have a little bit more investment from the beginning to build on PoP our self, but long-term will be more profit model, so we have a better margin so that, so we will take some time to make sure we build a healthy ecosystem, both with our partner and also with the investment for long-term benefit. Fatima Boolani : I appreciate that detail, Ken. Keith, just quickly for you, kind of a tactical question on the billings outlook. You're raising the full year by less than half of the beat and raised when I think about the first half. And so maybe from a bottom up perspective, can you walk us through what sort of underpinning that conservatism? I can appreciate the macro is jittery, but if you can kind of give us some more tangible considerations you're thinking about in terms of a bottom up perspective on getting to that billing guide for this whole year? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes. I would say one just kind of as a general thought, I think that raising it to some extent I think probably gives you a little bit of a message that we feel good about our strategy and the execution that level that we can bring to the market. But more specifically and more tactically as we look through the second half of the year, there's probably a little more rigor and effort, if you will, in trying to look at what we see coming in the second half of the year. And I would give you that probably the two headlines that we're looking at. One is we're still very, very pleased with the pipeline. The pipeline continues to be well above anything that we're talking about, growth rates for the company for the full year. But I think the nuance that and maybe it's not even a nuance really that's coming into play now it is more about close rates. It's not just as simple as taking your pipeline and assuming you're going to have close rates that were at the same level they were in prior periods, and that's when we use the term close rates, not a suggestion that deals are getting lost, but this continual cycle that we seem to be in, where some of the larger enterprise deals in particular are taking longer, they're pushing out a lot of pushes. It's not that there's been an increase in losses, but the continual push. And so with that in mind, I think a fair amount of attention of looking at the full year guidance on what we really think our close rates may be for the second half of this year. Fatima Boolani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. Ken, maybe just to start with you, great to see Fortinet sales of the whole breadth of the platform, particularly within the enterprise. Could you just maybe talk about anything that you can do to make it easier for customers to consolidate spending with Fortinet? Whether that's an enterprise license agreement or any other thing that sort of makes it easier to combine, consolidate those vendors, which was a theme I think was talked about earlier? Ken Xie : Yes we definitely see some healthy growth of enterprise agreement. And also we're working closely with our channel partner with our service provider also leverage their connection, their resource to build a healthy ecosystem to grow together. But I also see from enterprise level, they also see the benefit of consolidation, definitely. And also not just consolidate some of security product, but also on the expanded infrastructure go beyond the traditional network security. So that's also, we see pretty healthy growth like a cure, and we do see that we could enhanced technology side also has pretty healthy growth. Yes, the sales force also, you can see the number of 1 million deal both on the number and also on the dollar wise has a pretty healthy growth continue to accelerate and grow beyond the total building growths. So that's, that's a pretty healthy trend we see going forward to helping customer consolidate. Keith Jensen : Yes. And Saket, maybe just, this is Keith, just to go along a level deeper on what Ken is talking about there, and I'll give you maybe four quick examples. So yes, enterprise agreement is something that we've been doing now for probably a couple years. We track those in some ways as a different line of business in terms of the growth rates and particularly as we've moved into the enterprise, I think it's been very important to be there and we've been very successful with it. I think another illustration of trying to make it easier for customers was the example of the large retailer we gave in the call today. And we talked about the points program, right? Which is an easier way, I think, sometimes for them to, to get on board and consume more of the products. And I think also then when we sell, making sure that we're, our salespeople are well trained on the value proposition that we're offering, not just on the cost of the appliance or the throughput or the performance, but also what it means to the customers management costs and overhead costs as well. And so I think those types of things are all going into play here to support what Ken is talking about, about making it easier for customers to consume more products. Saket Kalia : Got it. That's super helpful. Keith, maybe for my followup for you, great to see that 30% growth and acceleration in services revenue. Maybe the question is, how do you think about what portion of your existing subscription base hasn't seen that cumulative impact of the price increases you've done yet. Right? Like clearly the price increases on product have been fully baked, but how much of the base, or maybe how long will it take for the subscription base to fully realize that pricing as well? Keith Jensen : Yes, great question and I think it didn't really look at the numbers closely this quarter we did last quarter. A couple things to keep in mind, the average contract term, call it 27 months, if all the contracts are 27 months, you could do that math, if they're not, some are one and some are three year contracts in terms of the renewals that are coming through. So, pardon me, one in five year contracts. Sorry, Peter. Thank you for that. So it does have a long tail and again, I'll refer you back to how many quarters or how a few years that we talked about seeing the uplift that came when we converted to 24 x 7 support from 8 x 5 that was something that continued to provide a benefit for several years. I think the tail gets smaller obviously as you go further out. I think the majority of what's -- of the existing contracts more than 50% are under the new pricing. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : And thank you. One moment for the next question. This next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal of TD Cowen. Your line is open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on results and guidance in tough macro. Keith maybe starting with you, can you comment, can you provide us with some color about the financial vertical performance this quarter? Keith Jensen : Yes, it is well, financial services have always been one of our, I like to say, always been for a long time. They were in the top three and it can be a bit future famine there with some very large deals in the quarter. But I don't think there was anything that was -- it was number two in this particular quarter. Thank you, Peter. I don't think there were any really large deals that drove that number. I think it was, we saw growth and success not only in the U.S., but also internationally, particularly in Europe. And so I think it was a strong quarter for us in that area. Shaul Eyal : Got it, got it. From a product mix perspective, so the entry level performed the best versus the high end. Is that just a mix or a macro reflection? And, and also did you have any eight digit wins this quarter? Keith Jensen : So we talked about it, yes, we did. Shaul Eyal : Okay. Keith Jensen : I think we talked about one in the script just a moment ago and I think we commented that was an eight figure deal, if I'm not mistaken, right, without giving a specific number. Yes and I don't recall if there was a second eight figure deal if there was a second. Ken Xie : Yes. Also our SMB [ph] had a pretty healthy growth. Like I said, the SMB is a more greenfield for the network security. We do see more and more SMB need and network security to protect their business, especially comes from some other ransomware attack. On enterprise because it's a kind of more replacement and also a lot of enterprise kind of maybe the bigger [indiscernible] how we're more dependent on the service. So that impacts some of the high end. And also the other benefit for some of the low and middle range is really most I would say most IC one and some of the OT deployment are maybe towards the low end, middle range. Shaul Eyal : Got it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Well done. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Rob Owens : Thank you very much and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to start around OpEx or the correlated operating margin and a very strong first quarter here, I think you mentioned it was the strongest Q1 that you've had since you're public. If I go back through results since you've been public, Q1 has never really been the high watermark from an operating margin standpoint. So walk me through your thought process as the rest of this year plays out was there some aberration in Q1 that really helped drive that or just a lot of conservatism as we look ahead? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think that we called out three things and maybe focusing on two; one, we had a very strong gross margin in the quarter and I'll elaborate on that in a moment. And then also FX, continues to provide a tailwind. More commentary about the gross margin, particularly the product gross margin as we move through, the supply chain challenges and then into inflation, et cetera. Over the last couple of years, I think we've talked publicly that our goal was to try and keep the product gross margin around 61% or so. The fourth quarter came in, obviously very low. We did not anticipate that we'd be able to time our price increases and the cost increases perfectly. So they went through the income statement in the same quarter, so to speak. And with that, I think you saw a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter and then you saw it kind of revert in the first quarter. I think longer-term, we also look at product gross margin as an opportunity sometimes for us to continue to invest in growth. And I think we saw the first quarter gross margin, certainly well above that band that I just talked about. And with that in mind, and as we start to see some of the costs moving out of the equation, and we introduce new products, I think we'll be looking at that in terms of is there an opportunity there to make certain investments in growth while maintaining the margin commitments that we've talked about. Rob Owens : Great. And then as a followup, I did want to touch on the OT business and the strength you're seeing there? Can you talk a little bit from a go-to-market standpoint and some of the channel programs, because it does seem like there's some new large channel partners out there that are very excited about the opportunities? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think OT, we do look at, I mean, you're always trying to organize your sales force around verticals, geographies, or what have you. And I think when we started to see the opportunity in OT several years ago, Patrice and Ken made a decision to start separating that out and having really a separate sales function and some people that specialize in that. I do think that we probably got some first mover advantages by doing that, particularly as we look at Europe and then quickly followed thereafter by the U.S. And yes, there are some large names that are in that space that are providing technology, not security technology, but technologies in the OT space that have been very receptive, if you will, to conversations and opportunities to meet with us. Operator : Thank you very much. One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg : Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just for Ken or Keith, obviously it's great to see the strong collections and the record free cash flow. And you also talked about contract terms being consistent year-on-year, and I was just curious though, just given the tougher macro, are you seeing any pushback by customers around willingness to pay upfront? And then I have a follow up. Keith Jensen : Yes. Well, first of all, I want to revel in the $600 million of free cash flow, which I've been doing it for some of more quarters, but I'm trying to let people know that a lot of the things fell our way in the quarter. There's always, the conversation in part of the sales cycle, if you will, the customers got a one-year, three-year, five-year deal. And certainly in a rising -- in an environment where interest rates have gone up, I think there's a lot more, many more conversations that exist, around payment terms and things like that. I do believe that, just as we just talked about in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID hit, we have a very strong balance sheet. We obviously have very strong margins, and it's appropriate for us to look at that, to that as opportunities to leverage our balance sheet and sometimes that may be in the form of extended payment terms or what have you, and our income statement in the form of, how we want to go about discounting and supporting growth. So I think that again, the strength that we've had, we have the ability to do those things. If the question is around what are we seeing from some of the enterprise customers, and Ken is seeing a lot of this as well, do we see deals that go from five years to three years? Sure. Is it more than we've seen in the past? I'd kind of look back at the contract term data point that we gave and say maybe, but not a lot kind of a thing. And on payment terms, the channel has always offered a financing function. I think they prefer to provide the financing function and then I think we provide support to the financing function to the channel by making capital available to them through payment terms. Adam Borg : That's really helpful. And maybe just as a quick followup, head count was up a little bit over 600 people, quarter-over-quarter up over 21.5% year-on-year. Just curious how we're thinking about headcount growth either in 2Q or later this year, again, just given the macro? Thanks again. Ken Xie : Yes, we are, overall we look at both headcount and headcount cost, probably the same pace, company grow the top line, and also try to, at the same time try to improve in some efficiency there. So we're now looking for headcount growth above the top line, even with few, there's a few some question in the area. We also need to do some more investment, on time investment. But companies so far, we feel we have a pretty healthy finance model and this also could be the opportunity to also gain in some market share. Adam Borg : Great. Thanks again. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] This question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : Thanks guys, and nice results. My first question I guess is on the U.S. enterprise, so not U.S. in general, but just the enterprise vertical, clearly one of the most important growth opportunities for you long-term. Can you talk about progress over there, win rates displacements, and is the macro making things easier or more difficult for you specifically in the U.S.? Ken Xie : First we continue to invest in the U.S. enterprise. We also see it's a huge growth potential for us because we have relatively small market share and with all the strong product technology we have. On the other side, the big environment definitely slowed down some of the enterprise making certain decisions whether to refresh or something like that. But on the other side our solution has a better lower total cost ownership and also can expand beyond the traditional network security and also helping customers to consolidate. So I think all this combined together, we do see the U.S. enterprise definitely is a strong grow area for us. Ittai Kidron : Okay, thanks. And then maybe followup on the competitive side and Ken, maybe you can talk about what have you seen out of your competitors in the U.S. and kind of abnormal activity from discounting or otherwise? Ken Xie : I think during the slowdown of some of the big environment, definitely the competitors starting do more aggressive whether on some discount or offer some free for some turn of the free some percentage of free service. But from all angle, we see we have much better product position, much broad like infrastructure coverage and better service, and also both on the performance angle. The product definitely has performed much better for the same function, same cost, and same time. The cost service also has much more value and costs lower than competitors. So for us, we have not experienced like price pressure or discount pressure. It is more about how we can increase the coverage, increase the lease and pipeline, and also to meet the customer need in this big environment change. Keith Jensen : Yes, I would think that with, when Ken talks about the figures is fantastic. I think keep in mind, we don't, we have a very, as we kind of talked about prepared market, a very diverse customer base, if you will, between being international, between being very large, mid, small, and MSSPs, et cetera. So I don't want put a policy in place that covers every geography and it covers every customer size. And I think what you're really talking about here is something that for us represents 15% of our business, maybe just a little bit less. And because it's at that size, it's something that we can really more, I think, target our responses to as we get deeper into the selling function as opposed to some broad announcement that we're going to give away services for two years or something like that. Ittai Kidron : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes to the line of Angie Song with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Angie Song : Hi, thank you guys so much for taking my question. I'm on for Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. So could you just share a little bit more about your current interest around the SASE or current customer interest around the SASE product and what are some of the responses around this so far? Ken Xie : It's a pretty strong growth. And also we're working with a lot of our service providers, both on the infrastructure side or our security service side, and offer the SASE because we do believe SASE should be a ecosystem with a lot of player instead of just a vendor offer their own SASE. Because a lot of I'd say probably most the customer, they prefer some of their data in process controlled themselves whether some privacy SASE or some data sovereignty, keeping the data within certain geo. So that's where we see the SASE approach, we call universal SASE gave the customer flexibility to offer both cloud based on primary space or kind of leverage service providing infrastructure will be more benefit for industry long-term. So that's where -- even sometime we kind of take a little bit more time to develop all the SASE function in the single always. But that's making more easy for the customer, for the service provider to deploy SASE to fit their need at their environment. So we see a very, very healthy pipeline and the strong growth kind of our salary growth. And that's also based on kind of a more healthy margin kind of model instead of do see money, all of our growth. So we want to maintain that model and also working closely with our partner to offer kind of a SASE together to the customer. Angie Song : Got it. Thank you. And just one more around profitability. So how are you guys thinking about -- us growth slows down over the next few years, and where do we to see that margin leverage? Keith Jensen : Angie, can you repeat that? You cut out in the beginning of that question. Angie Song : Yes, no worries. So the question is around profitability, and I was just wondering what you guys are thinking about upside to profitability as growth slows down, and where should we expect to see that margin leverage? Ken Xie : We see the midterm model would be $10 billion building by 2025 and with non-GAAP operating margin at least 25% for each year in the next three years. Angie Song : Got it. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think the one thing, Angie, and I think answer about this before as well, keep in mind, two-thirds of the business roughly is service revenue. And that's producing a gross margin that's in the mid-80s. So, and that's, those are longer-term contracts. So I think the business model is such that we'd have time to react if there was something really dramatic that happened in the industry. But part of that's, for that to happen, I think you'd probably have to see some sort of shift in the behavior of the bad actors, the nation states, the organized crime groups, et cetera. And we don't see that's on the landscape. Angie Song : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] This next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Hey guys. What we've seen with good companies in the last two quarters is that, they make great numbers, but when you look at the composition, new customers are slowing down and sales to existing customers are going up. And we've seen it through multiple companies in the space. So the question is whether you can provide us with some data on sales to existing customers versus new customers, and how is the current environment on customer acquisition, on new customer acquisition? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes. So as a reminder, Tal good to hear from you again, if you think of the business being, extremely diversified, whether that's geographically or by customer segments, one-third small, one-third mid, one-third large. We specifically called out in the script that we added over 6,000 new logos in the quarter. So obviously and that's probably a growth rate that's, easily into double digits. New logos take a while to really produce revenue for us, it tends to be, less than 10% of total revenue from the new logos. So it creates the opportunity to continue to sell into them. Kind of to Ken's comment a moment ago into your question here, do we see large enterprises in the U.S. still moving forward robustly with all their various digital transformation projects? I think that the, the word on the street is, that slowed down a little bit. And in that environment, I do think that incumbents sometimes have an advantage, but also a cost of performance argument and debate is something that you see customers perhaps more receptive to in the current macro environment Tal Liani : And in the current macro environment is the duration of contracts going down or is\u2026 Keith Jensen : It was flat year-over-year down one month, quarter-over-quarter. Tal Liani : Got it. Okay, thanks. Keith Jensen : Which somebody reminds me of the room very politely. Every first quarter is down one month. Tal Liani : Got it. Sequential. Yes. Operator : Thank you. One moment for the next question. This question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Okay. Thank you. And congrats on a nice quarter. So I wanted to ask about your SASE offering as well. You talked at the Accelerate Conference about I think having eight to 10 new use cases, driving demand for the firewall, but I'm wondering if SASE could be one of those use cases as well, meaning, is the firewall appliance a critical component of your SASE offering? Ken Xie : Yes, SASE definitely is the one the, the use case especially the universal SASE or sometime they called a private SASE for some customer, they some service provider, they want to have a more control of their data. So that's we see is both SASE like the service model, customer benefit service provider has a big value-added that one, but at the same time gave the flexibility of what your full of force some traffic to the cloud or to the pop or have a process on premise and by the appliance. So that's, we see the huge benefit of universal SASE solution, which is very different than some other SASE player and a lot of customers and the partner were interest to at this universal SASE approach. Andrew Nowinski : Thanks, Ken. And then maybe a question for Keith just as it relates to your CapEx, you talked about a component of that being used to build out more pops to support the SASE offering, but is that something like, how should we think about CapEx in that investment beyond 2023 as you continue building out your network? Keith Jensen : Well, Ken and I are smiling at each other. We've had this conversation that they're I think I've been here for nine years as of this week. One thing I've come to appreciate is that Ken behaves like a long-term investor, and with that in mind owning critical real estate assets tends to have a better payback than leasing them over an extended period of time. Whether that's in R&D facilities, whether that's in manufacturing or warehouse facilities, or that as you, as we move into that, into the SaaS market as well as other cloud offerings it's not just investments in SASE, if you will, but it's also investments in larger data centers in order to deliver various, cloud-based services and solutions. And I think you've heard us talk about that the last several earnings calls and the guys of, data centers having an impact on margins for services and CapEx spending. So I don't think there should be a surprise there, but I think it is a, an indication of our looking to expand into, more fully into some of these other markets. Andrew Nowinski : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. One moment for our final question. Our last question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari from Baird. Your line is open. Shrenik Kothari : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So for Ken or Keith I think Keith, you mentioned about the, the financial services up over 40%, which is surprisingly strong and contrary to what we are hearing from your peers and competitors. So can you expand a bit about upon the underlying drivers? I know you touched upon it but I just wanted to expand on the geographical diversity or is it increased kind of impetus for vendor consolidation that is benefiting you guys in that vertical? So if you can just elaborate and then I have a quick follow up. Keith Jensen : Yes, I would say it's all the above. It's happening geographically. I think it's happening with customers that we took down earlier that are expanding with us, with additional firewalls and additional security or additional services as well. I think the market, if you will, financial services, if you step back and look at what's happening there, specifically the firewalls over the last several years, there's probably two legacy vendors there that when they're contracts are up for renewal and we've talked about this for a long period of time, now they're exposed. And it creates an opportunity to come in for a competitive displacement. And I think that some of the other comments or questions today is, is it more difficult in this environment for competitive placements? I mean, sure, you got to work a lot harder to make it happen. You got to make your value proposition more well known. But I think, again I think it's expansion. I think it's opportunity to displace incumbents and I don't think it's specific to any one particular geography. Ken Xie : Yes. Also from technology angel, we have a two huge advantage. One is for the internal segmentation of secure data center. So because the ASIC advantage we have, we can deploy in the very high speed environment which a lot of us find service provider, they do need secure their kind of internal segmentation there. The other part, really some of finance service also starting to supporting work from home, working from remotely, which we also have a large super solution with our ASIC based like a small appliance supporting this kind of our broad infrastructure approach combined with that, like SD-WAN or the other 5G, 4G network and security together. So that gave us huge advantage from the product angle. Shrenik Kothari : Got it, got it. Thanks a lot, Ken, Keith just a quick follow-up. And you guys, of course, started upon the expansion opportunity in the form factors. Of course, your peers and parties have spoken about unit expansion pressure and how the product unit growth is kind of normalizing. But just wondering, given that give examples of this 8-figure expansion and upsell opportunity replacing kind of firewall with a holistic solution. Can you talk about like expansion drivers broadly like \u2013 are you seeing mostly upsell and expansion in form factors versus the units? Just imparted to get some clarification there. Ken Xie : Probably both. Yes, we do see the expanding of both the unit and also upsell cross-sell of the entire for the Security Fabric, which has 53 product. So that's where both our internal sales force also partners setting were lot [indiscernible] across for the whole fabric. At the same time, because we combine networking security and more function together multiply case, which also the unit shipment also starting keeping grow quite nicely. Shrenik Kothari : Got it. Thanks a lot. Ken, I appreciate it. Ken Xie : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A segment. I'll now turn it back over to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Chris. Apologies to the seven people we left in the queue. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by JPMorgan and Bank of America during the second quarter. Fireside chat, webcast links will be posted on the Events and Presentations section of the Fortinet Investor Relations website. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in the earnings press release and in the presentation that accompanies today's remarks, both of which are posted on the Investor Relations website.  Ken and Keith's prepared remarks for today's earnings call, will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website immediately following today's call.  Lastly, all references to growth there on a year-over-year basis unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over, Ken. Ken Xie : Thanks, Peter. Thank you Were we weren't for joining today's call to review our second quarter 2023 results. Total revenue in the second quarter increased 26%, driven by strong revenue growth service, which 30% for the second consecutive quarter, with 34% growth in existing subscription and scription and non-FortiGate product row over 45%, which is nearly $2 billion annual run rate, building growth of 18%, leads to more normalized product revenue growth of 18%.  We believe our building performance reflect large enterprise concern with the macro environment in addition to some uniquely indigestion after two years of elevated 30%-plus product building growth during the supply chain shortage.  According to IDC's latest quarterly security tracker, in addition to having the number one unit in firewall category for 10 consecutive year with over 50% market share, Fortinet is now the market share leader in both unit and revenue. Based on the latest Westland Advisory on Security and Cybersecurity report, Fortinet was named but only ITOT network protection platform leader. We are currently one of the top and the fastest growing OT security vendor in the market that Westland Advisor expect to grow to $33 billion by 2030.  Including our success line with our broad integrated platform, our proprietary ASIC security processor, and our ability to converge network and security both on prem and in the cloud across a single fully OS operating system, to leverage these advantages and drive future growth in addition to our leading network security solution, we have increased our go-to-market investment in universal setting as demand IoT security, cloud security and security operations. And we were dedicated more resource to support hybrid infrastructure and hybrid world.  Today we are announced new FortiGate 90G, our first next generation firewall after [Indiscernible] with the new security process of flat FortiASIC, that delivers industry-leading security function, performance, stability and power efficiency and cost effective price.  The FortiGate manages the fully integrated with our FortiGuard AI-power security service, and has secure computing reaching up to 16 times greater than average of our competitors similar price model are using over 90% less power than competing solution. We also announced two new SD-WAN service under the performance monitoring service to simplify operation and enhance digital experience as well overlay service to facilitate rapid deployment, redundancy and a seamless interconnection of location with for FortiSASE using SBA technology. This new SD-WAN service showcase our commitment to expanding our service leverage our leading installation base for additional future growth.  We see our single vendor SASE solution opening a large new market, and one where our sizable SD-WAN installed base can be leveraged as a significant market access point. Together with newly announced SD-WAN service, we plan to accelerate our global point of presence pop deployment, with a dual strategy of investing in our own pops as well as working with service providers.  Fortinet recently announced results of our IT-dependent analysis by Forrester, of the cost saving and benefits of the current FortiGate next gen firewall and FortiGuard AI powered secure surveys within enterprise datacenter, which include more than 300% return on investment over three years, pay back in six months and 90% reduction in time spent on manual updates. In addition, an independent analysis by Enterprise Strategic Group established that the customer who deployed Fortinet Security operation solution, such as FortiEDRand for the FortiNDR reduce their time to detect and respond to incidents from an average of three weeks to one hour.  This demonstrates the substantial impact that artificial intelligence machine learning and the integration of a Fortinet Secure op fabric product that have operations ability to secure today's rapidly expanding attack surface.  Finally, new developments in AI such as generative engine show a lot of promise to various applications of the security. We believe AI technologies can help us significantly improve productivity, and can be scaled to a large customer base in areas such as malware detection, thread hunting, event correlation and automation, as well as safety network design and troubleshooting.  Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for the continuous support and power. Keith. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. And good afternoon everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the second quarter. Billings growth was 18% as well as product revenue growth, service revenue growth held firm at 30%, resulting in total revenue growth of 26%, OT and SD-WAN revenue continue to perform well as revenue from these products were up 60% and 40%, respectively. In a sign of our strength in the small and midsized customer segments, we added a record 6,500 new logos. Operating margins of 26.9% exceeded the high end of the guidance range by 140 basis points. Free cash flow was strong at $438 million, representing a margin of 34%, benefiting from the deferral of certain cash tax payments to the fourth quarter.  Looking at buildings in more detail buildings of $1.54 billion were led by non-FortiGate billings over 30% growth, representing 34% of total billings. Non-FortiGate billings growth was driven by networking FortiGate VM, NAC [ph] and cloud. And as Ken mentioned, non-FortiGate is nearing a $2 billion annual revenue run-rate.  In terms of industry verticals, government and manufacturing topped the list as a percentage of total billings, with manufacturing up almost 50%, government and construction were up over 30%, while service provider and retail were up 1% and down 5% respectively. Retail was impacted by a very difficult compare, as the industry vertical nearly doubled in the year earlier period.  Billings growth vary by GIOS with international emerging leading, followed by Europe and the LatAm. APAC and to a lesser extent U.S. enterprise were challenged by difficult prior year comparisons. Deals over $1 million increased from 122 deals to 134 deals.  Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 26% to $1.29 billion, driven by non-FortiGate growth of over 45% and service revenue growth of 30%. This was the second consecutive quarter of greater than 30% service revenue growth. Security subscriptions represent over 55% of all service revenue and continue to streak a strong increasing sequential quarterly growth dating back to Q1 of '22 of 23% to Q2 of '23 at 34%. Product revenue of $473 million increased 18%. Product lead times and backlogs are expected to approach normal levels in the third quarter.  Total gross margin of 77.9% was up 140 basis points driven by 160 basis point increase in product gross margin to 63.5%. Product gross margin has benefited from earlier pricing actions and easing cost pressures and were partially offset by certain inventory charges. Service revenues were 63% of total revenues and delivered gross margin of 86.2%. Higher service revenue, offset higher labor costs and increased cloud delivery costs, as we continue to expand our cloud SASE delivery models.  We see our single vendor SASE solution opening a large new market and one where our sizable SD-WAN install base can be leveraged as a significant market access point. We plan to accelerate our point of presence or POP deployment, with a dual strategy Ken mentioned investing in our own POPs, as well as working with third party providers to accelerate our deployment.  Operating income of $348 million, grew 36% outpacing revenue grew by more than 10 points as operating discipline resulted in significant operating leverage. Operating margins of 26.9% exceeded the high-end of the guidance range and was up 210 basis points due to the strong gross margin performance and operational efficiencies.  Earnings per share increased 58% to $0.38 per share, and also exceeded the high-end of the guidance.  Looking into the statement of cash flow summaries on Slide 7 and 8, free cash flow increased 55% to $438 million. The adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments was $498 million, representing it 38.5% adjusted free cash flow margin. Free cash flow benefited from the deferral of approximately $190 million in cash tax payments. As mentioned last quarter, these tax payments together with other deferred 2023 tax payments are due to be paid in the fourth quarter.  Capital expenditures were $77 million, including $59 million of real estate investments. Cash taxes on the quarter were $38 million. The board recently increased the company's share repurchase authorization by 500 million. And the total available share buyback authorization is now approximately $2 billion. Now I'd like to share a few significant wins from the quarter that exemplifies the strength of our broad and integrated platform. First, a global pharmaceutical leader signed an eight-figure deal without Fortinet Cybersecurity Fabric, investing in our OT aware secure networking architecture, as well as our AI ops and threat intelligence solution.  Recognizing the market shift to a platform-based approach to security, this company selected Fortinet to secure its highly regulated and sensitive medical data that continues to drive global operational and financial efficiencies through our broad integrated and automated platform approach to cybersecurity.  In another deal, one of the largest U.S. school districts which had recently refreshed its datacenter firewalls to FortiGate was seeking to improve its network security posture with a NAC solution that offers better visibility to the devices connected to the network. Fortinet competed against multiple peers, and was able to win did a FortiNAC's ease of implementation, centralized management capability and superior risk remediation, as well as the tight integration to the district's existing Fortinet security fabric.  This high seven-figure deal was the largest NAC deal in Fortinet's history.  Finally, in the seven-figure displacement in our largest FortiSASE deal ever, a large bank on its digital transformation journey, who was searching for a single vendor SASE solution for its hybrid workforce. This selected our FortiSASE solution for over 5,000 users, as it integrates SD-WAN and SASE into a holistic solution and delivers comprehensive security, both from the cloud and on prem, while ensuring consistent security policies for all users regardless of their location, and wherever applications are being accessed. These transactions illustrate how Fortinet's platform strategy, integrated operating systems and proprietary ASIC technology continues to resonate with customers. Given the heightened interest in AI technology, we could not do this call without discussing Fortinet's investment and innovations in AI. Fortinet has been at the forefront of AI and machine learning innovation for many years, leveraging deep learning and artificial neural networks to power our products and security services, enabling a faster, stronger and more accurate defense for our customers.  One of our first AI-powered use cases was the introduction of the virtual FortiGuard Threat Analyst. FortiGuard addresses threats in real time with machine learning, coordinated protection and is extensively used in malware detection and threat hunting. Every time the threat is identified, FortiGuard generates threat intelligence that automatically updates defense signatures across the fabric. In cloud environments where scale and speed are critical, AI and machine learning can help security teams keep pace with threats on multiple fronts. All of this happens seamlessly and behind the scenes. Today, our platform Guest and Analyzer on average more than 100 billion events every day, to deliver over 1 billion security updates daily across the Fortinet security fabric and ecosystem.  While many of our competitors OEM their security from different security vendors. Our AI-driven FortiGuard threat intelligence has been built in house, which allows us to use AI across different sources. Adversaries increasingly are using AI in their playbooks to drive cyberattacks, which only increase the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.  We continue to invest in AI and machine learning technologies across our products, including generative AI, natural language models, and other implementations to enhance, simplify and automate security for our customers.  Before moving to guidance, I'd like to offer some observations about the second quarter and about the industry. Regarding the second quarter, we believe macro and certainly impacted our billing performance to average contract duration, and in the second half of June, and the elevated level of enterprise deals pushing the future quarters.  We saw shorter contract duration, with the average term decreasing by 1.5 months to 28 months, creating a 4 to 5 point billings headwind year-over-year. Normalizing billings growth with a change in contract duration, yields billings growth in the low-20% range. Having some level of enterprise deals pushed to future quarters, it's not unusual. In Q2 '23 however, an unusually large volume of deals that we expected to close in June, instead push to future periods. From a market perspective, CIOs continue to prioritize and invest in securing their organizations in the face of rising cybersecurity threats. We see new regulatory requirements, such as the recently announced -- those recently announced by the SEC and the EU Cyber Resilience Act announced earlier this year. They will continue to provide market tailwinds as organizations further increase their cybersecurity investments to comply with new stringent cyber regulations.  The cybersecurity industry remains highly relevant as CIOs prioritize cyber spending within the overall IT budgets. As such, the longer term demand drivers for Fortinet net remained very solid.  That said, we do see a return to more normal seasonality for Fortinet in the back half of the year. That's tailwind such as the supply chain driven growth subsides. And we cycled prior period price increases.  Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our third quarter full year outlook, which are summarized on Slides 11, and 12, are subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call.  For the third quarter we expect billings in the range of $1,560 million to $1,620 million which at the midpoint represents growth at 13% and is consistent with our quarter-over-quarter seasonality prior to the pandemic. Revenue in the range of $1,315 million to $1,375 million which at the midpoint represents growth of 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% or 76.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5% to 25.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.37. This assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. Capital expenditures of $100 million to $130 million non-GAAP tax rate of 17% cash taxes of $25 million. And as previously mentioned, backlog is expected to approach normal levels in Q3.  For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6,490 million to $6,590 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 17% and apply slightly below normal seasonality in Q4. Revenue in the range of $5,350 million to $5,450 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 22.3%. Service revenue in the range of $3,350 million to $3,410 million with the midpoint represents growth at 28.2%. The service revenues guidance implies product revenue growth at 13.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.25% to 76.25%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25.25% to 26.25%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 to $1.53, which assumes a share count of between $795 million and $805 million. Capital expenditures of $335 million to $385 million due to our continued cloud data center and facilities investments. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, cash taxes of $460 million with approximately $380 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to execute our long-term strategy and remain confident in the strategy and our solutions. While it's a little early to be providing guidance for next year, we would expect our near term performance or represents a short term trough. Given our confidence in our solutions, our offerings -- and taking into account that growth comparisons will ease as we move through 2024 that this early stage we would expect billings growth to approach high-teens by the fourth quarter of 2024.  And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. Operator -- just one quick reminder before doing the Q&A, if you can please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question. Operator, you can open the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from [Indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Ken, I think you noted that -- and Keith commented to it as well, reflected -- I guess, the billings performance and guidance reflects enterprise concern about the macro. Could you give a little bit more color there on what you saw from a macro perspective?  And I think you pointed to a weak service provider business. I think investors might draw parallels to what they saw at Juniper last week on the carrier side. Maybe if you could include a few thoughts on how dynamics there may be similar or different with regard to what you see? And then I have a follow-up. Ken Xie : Sure. I think for the carrier service provider, we do see they're probably a little bit behind on offer some surveys because the carrier service provider, if you look back 10-15 years ago, is our biggest market. It's like about 30% market share comes from the carrier service provider. But nowadays, security need additional service like some SASE, all these function -- function in the SASE, which service provider kind of behind, so we're still working with them and closely try to help them accelerate the service. At the same time, we're also starting to invest a little bit more self, which also, like together with the new service we announced today, the two new SD-WAN service, we feel invest in certain infrastructure that will help in drive a lot of new service going forward in the security space, and also in helping service providers to kind of accelerate some of their security service beyond the traditional security service. Keith Jensen : Yes. I would probably add to Ken's comments, particularly as we talk about service providers and some of the other verticals and customer segments. And I think there are some lessons that we can see from, for example, manufacturing, which did extremely well in the quarter. They continue to have -- I feel they think they're under pressure in the threat environment, so you see them spending fairly richly. It's still a surprise,  If you look at the government sector which was strong also, they have governments in the -- they have budgets on the slowing economy that maybe some of the other industries don't. And at the other end of the spectrum, Ken talked about service provider, and people I think are aware of that story there more broadly. But also retail, I think retail is really a very clear indicator of a vertical that can be one of the first that is sometimes impacted by a slowing economy. But also, Ken made reference to this in his comments, this concept of digestion. A lot of purchasing around SD-WAN technologies and implementations. A year ago, you saw very, very high growth a year ago. And now going through a digestion period, such as the point that it's actually negative growth in the retail vertical. Ken Xie : We're also interested in some cloud provider also started getting in the security space, which also kind of confused some of the enterprise customer. So that's also sometimes they take a little more time to evaluate our different solutions. So we do believe this is a hybrid approach on-premise in the cloud that will be best for the customer, even the cloud probably much more expensive or cost an average about 3x to 5x more expensive compared to on-premise, but it's -- combined altogether probably will be the best solution for customers. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up for Keith, I think you talked about a reinflection to high teens billings growth next year. How does performance this quarter and your outlook for the rest of the year impacted 2025, I guess, $10 billion billings target that you've previously thrown out there? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think that as we go through the second half of the year and we enter into our normal planning cycle for 2024, I think that will be a logical output at that point in time to think through what we're seeing in terms of our 2025 targets. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much for your question. Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges with GS. Your line is open. Gabriela Borges : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Keith, I want to say on the medium-term outlook, your comment on high-teens billings growth by 4Q '24, if I heard it right. Maybe just talk us through how you thought about derisking the six-month and the 18-month kind of outlook? And what are some of the leading indicators you are looking to determine when billings growth and product revenue will trough? Thank you. Keith Jensen : I don't know, Ken, if you want to talk about longer-term trends in the industry and now avoid [ph] guides for 2024, if you do that. Ken Xie : Look back to like a -- certainly, yes, with the industry, network security still have a pretty good pace of growth, probably between 10% to 20% on average in the last like 30 years. And we feel we have a very unique, huge advantage solution, which we -- we only want to build our own ASIC. You can see the product we announced today, which has probably averaged about 10x better performance, more function compared to competitive solution and also much less energy consumption, probably like a 90% less energy consumption.  So that's where the new SP5 actually -- the first product announced actually is that we have a 14 application engine integrated the ASIC chip, probably more than double compared to the previous version. That's also helping drive the next few quarter growth, which each -- probably every quarter, we may plan to announce a new product, you can see 5. That's a huge advantage and then it also drives the long-term convergence of networking to network security, which can agreed by 2030, the network security will be larger than the traditional network in there. So that's what continue to network security side growth. On the other side, we also mentioned a few other areas. We see kind of the non-FortiGate part also growing pretty strong, so 45%. It's part of it because consolidation, part of because certain like security budget allocation to certain cloud spending can be allocated to some security. And the other part also, kind of like how to manage on different kind of vertical and also some inventory side. That's also we try to balance. We do believe things will be recovered in the later part of next year. And because -- the last two years, we see quite a strong product revenue growth, second quarter over 50%, which is not quite normal. But it's -- once we get more normal, so that will be pretty much return to the average in the last 20-30 years, which is about 10% to 20%. Keith Jensen : Yeah. And as I kind of take that commentary and pull it forward a little bit and say, Q3 and Q4, and I suspect I'll get a fair amount of chance -- opportunities to talk about the guidance setting process for Q3 and Q4. I guess I would start off by saying we've certainly seen over the last two or three years in various environments we've been in. You got to be pretty nimble in terms of your assumptions and what you're looking for. And with that in mind, I think I called out in the comments, you see the level of deals that pushed in the second part of June. It was a new development. We always have linearity of the deals closed to see the deals push. And I think 1 comment I would offer is that as you look -- as I look to the Q3 guidance setting and the roll-up, the assumptions for Q3 were to close rates and terms and things of that nature and push. I would say, look a lot more like the assumptions that we saw in actual results for Q2 than maybe what we saw with some higher rates, better rates earlier on. So I think there's some caution built into that, if you will. I think also if you kind of look at the results, where the guidance ends up, you can look at top line growth in Q3 versus Q2 that I think is in the low-single digit growth sequentially. And that's pretty much in the range of where we've seen Q2 to Q3 historically, and we would expect that again.  And then maybe just a little more caution in the fourth quarter where -- and again, I made a comment earlier that the seasonality assumption that falls out of the guidance for the full year and is applied to the fourth quarter actually suggests a lower level of growth in the fourth quarter than we've seen in other periods. Offering a certain degree of caution, number one, but also acknowledging that Q4 last year was a very strong quarter and pretty tough compare. Ken Xie : Also, we do see some strong growth in the new area like SD-WAN OT, which grew 40% and 60%, total come on 25% of billings. And also the 5G growth not quite start yet, so we all have the best product for all these new solutions. So that's the additional growth, right, as we're keeping developing. Gabriela Borges : That all makes sense. Thank you. And just to clarify, is it safe to assume that 4Q, or are you assuming that 4Q billings will be the trough for billings growth? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I'd have to go back and look at the actual compares because the compares start easy and I don't want to mix up bookings and billings in this conversation because the timing is a little bit different. But I think that the growth in billings in Q4 and Q1 of -- Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year were very, very strong. Ken Xie : Also, you can refer to the finance presentation #10 page, which we go back to 13 years since we IPO-ed 13 years ago. So there's some kind of a growth, some kind of margin information. Gabriela Borges : Yeah, I do like that Slide 10. Thank you for calling that out. Okay, thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, very much. Our next question will come from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Tal Liani : Yes. Thank you. I'm going to ask my two questions together, with your permission. The first one is Palo Alto is posting their quarterly call for Friday evening, which is always a bad sign historically for that quarter. And then you are reporting weaker than expected, although you were very positive last quarter. I remember the calls.  So does it mean that the environment deteriorated in the last three months? And if the environment deteriorated, what is the source for it? Meaning, is it the backlog drawdown issue that we were concerned with before? Or is it that customers are deciding not to buy, push out? I'm trying to understand the meaning of both you and Palo Alto, two successful companies kind of comments. The second question is, Keith, in your remarks, you said that projects were pushed out. But if it were pushed out, why do we see a deceleration -- continued deceleration into 3Q and 4Q? Because I can back out your 4Q guidance, and billings is declining from 18% to 13% to 11%. And if it was a push out, then we would have seen a recovery in the second half from pushouts from 2Q. So how do you connect your comments about pushouts versus cancellation to the numbers to the guidance? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I'll go first, and then Ken can talk about what his friend down the street is doing or not doing, to his knowledge. As I kind of alluded to, I'm not -- yes, I had pushouts in the quarter. I'm happy with what I saw in terms of July on deals getting closed, but I've retained concept of continuing pushouts in Q3 and Q4. I'm not here to suggest that there's going to be a quarter recovery in that. I think that this is going to be -- take a little bit longer through this economy kind of normalizes and this digestion process goes on.  So I think it's really -- yes, picking up something in Q3 from Q2, but I'm also anticipating I'm going to see some things move from Q3 to Q4. And also the compares, if you go back and look at in Q3 and Q4 on the billings line, those are pretty attractive numbers that we put up in Q3 and Q4 of last year. What's he up to? Ken Xie : I don't know why Palo Alto is like at Friday afternoon, which is probably -- I'm not one want to answer the question. But on the industry, we do see some company, especially large companies, to be more tight on the budget, and also kind of take a little bit long time to closing. It's not just that this quarter, basically pretty much starting early this year, there is some sign of that one.  How long will last? It's tough to say, but it's -- nearly the security is basically an underspend, then they probably will be starting to go back up after probably a few quarters. On the other side, if you see when the big environment starting kind of tough or tight, they tend to be more hand on the current product, current solution and then buy more service, which we also try to help new customers net whatever they have on hand to offer more service, like the SD-WAN service we announced today. So, let's see, the service revenue starting kind of doing well, leverage or kind of the last few years. The product revenue growth, which we already be the #1 in the product revenue in the whole network security space, which is over 28% market share, and also unit shipment is over 52% market share. So I think we'll continue to keep leading in the space and with new technology solutions, like the FortiGate 90G we announced today. But it's -- for us, more focused on long term. So we do believe the long-term convergence of network to network security, we feel we have the best technology product to meet that challenge. And at the same time, the short-term environment, we tend to be also see as an opportunity to keep gaining market share. Tal Liani : Got it. It's -- can you talk about -- I know you don't provide backlog, but can you talk about the backlog trends and how much of what we're seeing last quarter, this quarter, next quarter is still supported by backlog versus the environment itself? We are all looking through this. The question is whether first half of '24, for example, we can get to single-digit growth instead of the double digits? You talk about the end of the year. So I'm not asking you for guidance for first half, but trying to understand how much of current trends are supported by backlog. Ken Xie : Yeah, the backlogs are already back to normal now, back to that before the supply chain issue. And you can see last year towards the middle to the end, we already see the FortiGate. We already solved the issue. The majority of most of that will come from some network-related products. That's also been eased up in the first half of this year. Backlog kind of back to normal before the supply chain addition. And they do have certain cancellation. Ideally the cancellation, probably double digit? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think Ken is giving you not the accounting answer on backlog numbers, but the CEO version that he's done worrying about it, and he knows the company can manage their way through it. From a numbers viewpoint, we still have some backlog that we -- that will pick up. Some low single-digit benefit in Q3. And then to Ken's point, we think that largely, as you get out of Q3, we'll have a -- we'll be back to very close to normal backlog numbers. Tal Liani : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much for taking my questions. I want to ask one of Tal's questions maybe a little bit differently. A lot of what you shared suggests your market position remains strong, and we've always thought that the price performance advantage of your architecture should enable you to actually take share in a tougher environment. I guess what many you're trying to figure out is if it's tough for Fortinet, does that implicitly mean it's tougher for others out there? And is there anything maybe you can share on competition, that would be helpful perhaps win rates or pricing dynamics that you're seeing in the market? Ken Xie : I think we do have the best solution at special level of the ASIC chip. So the product revenue still grew by 18% compared to, I think, checkpoints of minus 12%, I believe, and some other vendors is low single digit so we still feel we're keeping gaining market share. On the other side, we also see some consolidation, so it's leverage our installation base. We see some of the other products that are kind of helping sell. But on the other side, probably two other kind of maybe timing-related issue when you can see the last two years on the product revenue growth, if we go on Page 3 or Page 4? [Indiscernible] finance statement here. Because you see, the product revenue growth is probably like 40%, 50% in some quarter, but over 30% in the last two years.  So I do believe some kind of inventory is being held by certain customers or some other partner or kind of service provider channel. And we're also kind of changing the policy, service grace period policy early this year, I think, in March or April. Which instead of give some of the channel like one year, they can enable service, we tighten that up to like 90 days, which can help in reduce the -- some inventory level in certain partner there. At the same time, we do announce the ISP side early this year, and today is the first product available based on the new ASIC SP5 which probably like four times, five times better performance and more application being accelerated, and at the same time, the same cost. And it's kind of -- I do believe certain partners, certain customer may be also waiting for some of the new products leverages technology, so that maybe also has certain kind of impact. Keith Jensen : Yeah. Brad, it was a great question and kind of follow on with Ken there. When I look at the win rates for, say, our top 3 competitors, right, they are in the firewall market, I'm not really seeing a change in the win rates, loss rates. They were quite consistent, maybe improved in one of the three cases that -- of the names that we know. I think that what -- what we don't know is how much is specific to us was that we had deals teed up for the last couple of weeks of the quarter that we're on a path to close and they did not close. So how -- the question comes is that something about the macro and the enterprises that are pushing out spending a little bit? Or is it some area that we need to reprove on in terms of how we go at our own internal inspection and forecasting and look at the detailed deals, right? We'll know more about that as time plays out. Ken Xie : Yeah, the regional slowdown is more because of very strong growth when years ago, almost double, and now it's going to slow down. The carrier service provider is still not ramp up yet, so we do hope they will ramp up soon. Brad Zelnick : Thanks for the color, Ken. And just my follow-up, Keith. As we think about pricing, which has been a tailwind across the whole market, I think, given supply constraints over the last couple of years. Can you give us any update of what the trends are now as supply eases? And what's embedded in your your assumptions for your guide on billings for this year and next? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think that what we look at -- go back our approach we've had for many years when we introduced a new product, and you heard about the 90G today. Our starting point is even though it has superior functionality capacity throughput, et cetera, is we generally price that along the lines of its predecessor. I think one thing that we're seeing as we move into the second half of this year, some opportunities to take, maybe some targeted pricing actions around use cases. For example, maybe if you get really far down the low end of the market where you're dealing with some low-cost franchisee models, maybe we would take some opportunities there to perhaps offer some incentives to our channel partners and such to participate in that market.  So I think the margins are obviously very, very strong on the product side, and we have that benefit there. So I do think it gives us the opportunity to make certain investments in the second half of this year, whether you want to call it price less or discounts or rebates or incentives to the channel partners. Brad Zelnick : Thank you, very helpful. Operator : Thank you for your call. Our next question is from Eunji Song with Morgan Stanley. Eunji Song : Hi. Thank you, guys so much for taking my question today. In terms of cancellation rates, could you guys give us any directional color on backlog cancellation rates? And what's assumed in your guidance by year-end? And I have a follow-up after. Keith Jensen : Last quarter, I think cancellation maybe we said was high single digits? This quarter, we say it's low, low double digits, right? And as backlog continues to subside as Ken pointed out a moment ago, it's not really going to make that much of a difference whether that cancellation rate goes from low double digits to mid-teens or something, or even 20. Eunji Song : Got it. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, what percentage of revenue came from SD-WAN and OT security this quarter? Ken Xie : We see together over 25%, pretty similar to last few quarters, but also growing pretty strong, 40% SD-WAN, 60% OT. Peter Salkowski : We have over 25% of the bookings number. I don't think we've given a revenue number for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia -- excuse me, from Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, here. Ken, maybe just to double-click on the competitive question a little bit, but zero in on one segment. I'm wondering how you're seeing SASE vendors in this market? Meaning, do you feel like the -- maybe backing up. Keith, very helpful comment just on how the competitive win rates trend versus the other traditional network security providers. But when you look at SASE, do you feel like the growing prevalence of SASE is impacting firewall appliance decisions at all? Ken Xie : I think it's a little bit different market. Somehow the service provider, the traditional telecom service provider or the service provider, we are a little bit behind in the last five to 10 years. So that gave the SASE provided opportunity to offer the service. But I do believe a lot of the telecom service provider, cloud provider, they have a huge advantage on infrastructure and the cost advantage to offer some additional security service, so which we're also working closely with them. And at the same time, we also invest some of our own kind infrastructure because also, a lot of our additional service beyond SASE like the SD-WAN, the other FortiGuard, [Indiscernible] and FortiCare service also need some of the infrastructure, which we're making more profit model, cost-efficient model. Compared to some other SASE providers, they have to whether lease or whatever, which tend to -- would like double, triple the cost compared to the similar service owning the infrastructure. But it's the new service offered by the SASE provider. We do see mid sort of enterprise need, which we also started to invest more in this area. Saket Kalia : Got it. Got it. Keith, maybe for you for my follow-up. Very helpful commentary just on the billings duration in the quarter. I think that definitely helps bridge the gap with at least the guide on billings in Q2. But maybe looking forward, how are you thinking about billings duration for the second half of this year? And I don't know, is there a way to kind of do the same exercise, like what would billings have been if the duration would have been in line with your original plan? Keith Jensen : I mean, the spreadsheet for the second part of that question Saket. So I will come back --- Saket Kalia : No, no problem. We can take it offline. Keith Jensen : No, that's fine. I think there's been conversation over the last, say, three or four quarters about would duration slow down. And we commented that we had seen some slowdown in duration. Not 1 month a quarter, but it would kind of bounce around a little bit.  The point I'm making is when you're measuring year-over-year growth, we lost 1.5 points of duration, which works out to be about 4 or 5 points growth. So when you're making the comparison on a growth basis, it really is a factor there.  And then if you want to get in the SASE part of it, remember, that product is not impacted by duration, only services are, so you get a partial impact. I think if you're looking forward, as I made the point, as we look at Q3 and Q4, the duration assumption that, I would say, is in that pool of things that I looked at what we saw in Q2 in terms of actual results and how those -- some of those metrics and assumptions that go into the guidance setting process differed from what I've been saying for the prior few quarters and place a very heavy reliance on what I saw in Q2, whether that deal's a push or whether a term or a bucket of other things. So without going into specifics, I would probably answer that question that way. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Ken Xie : Yeah, some additional point of SASE is very -- especially a lot of companies starting return to work, return to office. So we do see a lot of like, call it, universal SASE, which is supporting both on-premise in the office and also work from home because if you back in office, forward all of office traffic to the part of SASE provided and the process, then back to the office not make much sense.  And at the same time, we see a lot of leverage or SD-WAN leadership there. We do see a lot of required the single vendor SASE. And also some bigger company also, they try to do the call the private SASE solution. So instead of process SASE traffic in the service provider part, they want to own process in their own kind of datacenter infrastructure, which also we do believe will be a big potential market going forward. Saket Kalia : Thanks, guys. Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Shaul Eyal : Thank you for taking the question. Good afternoon. Keith or Ken, can you maybe talk about the performance that you've seen with your go-to-market as it relates to your top sellers? Was there anything non-balance this quarter? Keith Jensen : I'm not quite sure -- are you looking for the distribution of salespeople hitting quota? Or -- I'm not sure I follow the question you're try to get at, Shaul. Shaul Eyal : So actually, I'm looking for your value-added resellers, your notable ones, the biggest one, and whether performance was even or balanced or not, during the quarter? Keith Jensen : I don't have that data handy, to be honest with you. Ken Xie : Yeah, we do see some release from exclusive network, which probably one of biggest picture also. We also want their biggest distributor, probably 30% business top on, but they're a little bit more --- Keith Jensen : Sorry, resellers I'm sorry. I don't know. You're answering the right question. [Indiscernible] distributors, yeah. Ken Xie : Yeah, I think it's a similar common, as we are seeing. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I don't think that -- of our business, if you will, shifted at all significantly. We look at our top three and our top six distributors, we're fairly concentrated in that regard. That mix doesn't really change all that much, maybe point or 2 in the quarter. That wasn't something that we saw that's just out there at us. Ken Xie : Yeah. Also, even go back to the history also going forward, also pretty similar kind of a forecast, I believe. Keith Jensen : Yes. Shaul Eyal : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Your line is open. Joseph Gallo : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Given the breadth of your platform, you have a better vantage point than most. When you talk to CISOs, where is the relative health in the cyber budgets? And where are you seeing the most resistance?  And then given your optimistic comments on '24, what lends confidence that this is only a one to two quarter digestion period? Is there any historical context to support that? Keith Jensen : In terms of CISO spending, obviously, there's -- the things that were getting media attention out there now, I suspect that we sit down with a CISO that we talking about it. Whether that's SASE or something with some of the AI technologies, what have you.  But I don't think that CISOs and CIOs get away from having to take care of -- tending their knitting, if you will, with their infrastructure. There are obviously to be new use cases for firewalls. Opportunities, if you will. There's use cases still exists on-prem that need to be secured. There's new cases in the cloud, the Edge, et cetera. I think it's a very difficult career position to be at CISO right now with the budgets and threats that are after them. As it relates to 2024, I think whenever -- pardon me, 2024, we'll go through our planning cycle more religiously as we do the second half of the year. I think the point that Ken and I were making is really, as we move back to a more normal buying pattern after we move through the supply chain in the pandemic and so forth, that's what the industry has been historically and we would have every expectation that we'd be able to get back in that sweet spot, if you will.  And I would also note that as the -- it's not a static comparison. And by that, I mean the compares get easier in every quarter as you go through 2024. Ken Xie : The CISO, we talk to this to have a certain shortage of people they can leverage to supporting the work for home or hybrid work environment, and so that's why they tend to a little bit more try to use in certain service kind of approach. On the other side, we do see the need to make sure that the new infrastructure, whether supporting back to office or supporting like we call it universal SASE versus the T&A [ph] environment, because there's like so many tech service starting kind of this impact and process new area like OT security. That's kind of -- but also certain security budget, they also because some companies, they commit certain cloud spending. Sometimes that is not commit spending for certain security, we also see some of that case. So that's what's happening.  So that's where we also kind of keeping ahead and helping the situation which is also -- most of the CISO fuel help supporting the operation is a pretty big to help -- help them to solve the issue there. And also leverage some kind of AI, some new technology and also kind of more broadly deployed network security inside the infrastructure. It's also supporting hybrid work environment. It's also quite a high priority for them. Joseph Gallo : Thanks. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, as we work through this digestion period, how should we think about investments in hiring? You've outperformed in the first half on profit, but your guide doesn't necessarily reflect a continuation of that. Where should we think of the incremental investments from here and the classic growth versus profit debate as billings moderate? Thanks Ken Xie : We're still hiring and -- but also, the high probably will be a little bit behind on the top-line growth. Make sure we're keeping the -- improving the productivity efficiency. But also, we probably will also try to enhance certain hygiene process, which we kind of not quite do in the last two-three years during the pandemic, which certain low performance. We probably need to be kind of more disciplined through -- to have certain performance review of kind of participant. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I would use that to kind of come back to, I think, Shaul's question and make a couple of points. I think that as Ken kind of pointed out, we've had a lot of salespeople. We certainly have sales capacity to deliver on the numbers. At the same time, I think we've been very faithful to -- when we talk about 25% operating margin, and you see us continually coming in above that. So we have the opportunity there to invest more. And on that note, I think that the conversations with the channel partners, the distributors that we're having, I think they're much more informative, detailed at the right levels now than they were two years ago. There's a lot more cooperation information sharing with the distributors.  And I think a byproduct of that is I think there's some opportunities for us maybe to invest in our channel partners in a variety of different ways as we go through this next 12 to -- probably six to 12 months. Ken Xie : Yeah. I kind of keeping refer to the Page 10. The last 13 years, the gross margin. So that's where we have the margin, and we've been GAAP profit of the three years since IPO. So if we need to invest in the growth, we definitely have the margin to do that. But on the other side, we also want to keep a healthy, healthy model and take care both on the growth and margin. Joseph Gallo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Mr. Nowiski, your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Thank you. I want to ask about the geographic demand trends. So you saw -- I think you saw strength in international regions in Europe. I was just wondering how sustainable do you think that demand is in those regions? Or are they just maybe one to two quarters behind the U.S. in terms of seeing the impact from the macro? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think that we have a competitive advantage when you look at Europe and parts of the international emerging, where we are oftentimes viewed as being the incumbent to have number one market share. So in an environment in which maybe the IT budgets start to suffer more in Europe than they do in the U.S., which is not what we're seeing currently, right? Currently, we're seeing the IT budgets are lower in the U.S. than they are in Europe based on some recent surveys.  I think we're better prepared to work our way through that in Europe because of our dominant position in that market. Andrew Nowinski : Okay. Got it. And then I think you talked about seeing strength in the SMB segment, adding about 6,500 new logos. I guess I was wondering, as it relates to your universal SASE solution, can you just talk about maybe how you're competing against, if at all, against Microsoft's new Entra solutions that are targeting that market? Ken Xie : Yeah, we kind of more leverage our huge installation base and also the technology, the product, which address the network security. Microsoft definitely have some good customer base in the enterprise side. But on the network security, which is addressed more beyond the sort of enterprise, definitely, we have some advantage there. And also we're not seeing Microsoft have any solution to address network security area. So we do believe there's an opportunity for both companies. Andrew Nowinski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Trace.

Good afternoon and thank you to everyone for joining our call. In Q3, we exceeded street expectations in our operation margin and free cash flow. However, building and product revenue fell below our expectation due to a slowdown in secure networking growth, along with challenging in sales execution and marketing efficiency. In response to the slowdown in secure networking market, we are shifting our marketing and sales team's focus towards a faster-growing secured operation as SASE market over the next few quarters. How while maintaining our consistent focus on leading innovation in secure networking and the convergence of security and networking where we have been a leader for 23 years. While we anticipate limit ear-term growth in secure networking market, it is very important for Fortinet. As we believe, enable us our platform strategy with a massive footprint in the market leader as the market leader in both firewall revenue and units shipped. The secure networking market is valued at $62 billion [ph] and is projected to increase high single digits annually to $86 billion [ph] by 2027. Our consistent focus on [indiscernible] our industry-leading DOS which supported over 30 network function networking and security application combined with our ASIC-driven performance capability which provides flight to 10x better performance on average than competitors continue to drive our market share gains. Secure networking remain a vital part of our strategy and a market that we believe will return to double-digit annual growth over time. We have been innovating for some time in the faster-growing segment of secure operations and SASE. Security operations also known as setup is a $46 billion market growing at mid-teens annually to $78 billion by 2027. Fortinet our platform is comprehensive and integrated offering EDR, SIM, SAR, MD and other integrated solutions. Consolidation in the security demand seamless integration and underlying secured tools. Fortinet strength lies in its innovation and its ability to enable automation through a high degree of product integration. Our AI and product and power automatic stock business second, all underpinned by a single consolidated management and analytics platform. In addition to SecOp [ph], we have continued to increase our focus on SASE. A $17 billion market expected to grow at a 20% compose growth rate to $36 billion by 2027. We believe Fortinet is the only company with a SASE service solution that can perform all functions in the cloud or email and is on with a common operation system. Including 4 networking and security set, market-leading SD-WAN, vWAN and the management council. Our SASE service solution is supported by Google Cloud. With over 100 worldwide SASE cloud location together with our own 30-plus point present and the data centers. For our client-based use case, we are salary SASE service function using our ASIC technology. For instance, we recently announced a Fortinet 1.8G with a security process a side. Which support our full SASE offering which including SD-WAN, firewall, Secure SD-WAN gateway, big lock prevention and boost secure computing region 6 to 54x better than our competition. We anticipate that success in SASE market will first come from upselling SASE service to our installed base of tens of thousands of AT1 customers. And from attracting new customers looking to leverage a single-vendor integrated SASE service solution. Our industry leadership in both firewall and SD-WAN -- the 2 largest components of SASE provides us with a significant competitive advantage. We have a track record of successful execution and believe we are the only company with strong SASE service and the setup solution combined in the same operation system. This differentiation sets us apart and provide us with a significant competitor advantage over peers. While we expect top line growth to be modest for the next few quarters due to challenging networking comparison and our business transformation realignment towards security operation and SASE. We anticipate growth return to double digits by the second half of 2024. We remain committed to generating healthy operating margin of 25% or greater in 2024 and 2025. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken and good afternoon, everyone. As Ken mentioned, we are confident in our integrated 400S driven platform strategy which is summarized on Slides 6 through 10 of the earnings slide deck. As we look forward, we believe shifting our R&D and go-to-market investments in the faster-growing SASE and SecOp markets is consistent with near-term market opportunities. As shown on Slide 10, SASE and SecOps account for 20% and 10%, respectively, of our business today. And as shown on Slide 7, these markets are expected to grow in the mid- to high teens annually. Secure Networking which currently accounts for 70% of our business, is expected to experience lower growth following 2 years of very robust growth. As a result, for the near term, we expect to deliver healthy profitability along with more modest growth. With execution and continued investment in the SASE and SecOps markets, we believe we can return to delivering mid- to high teens top level growth -- top line growth and while continuing to deliver operating margins of 25% or greater. In other words, a return to balance growth and profitability which has led us to achieve the rule of 40 status in 12 or 15 years, as shown on Slide 19. In a moment, I'll expand on the strategic shift by sharing a few of the tactical steps and investments. But first, I'd like to review some highlights from the quarter. We continue to add new logos at an impressive rate and saw top line performance in small enterprise and software was strong while operating margin and free cash flow were above expectations. We added over 6,400 new logos, supported by small enterprise customers which grew bookings by 19%. Our efforts to manage personnel and other costs drove our operating margin to 27.8%, 230 basis points above the high end of the guidance range. Free cash flow was strong at $481 million, representing a margin of 36%. Looking at billings. Starting from the third quarter of 2022, we saw a 3-year compounded annual billings growth rate or CAGR of 26%, illustrating our ability to drive strong and sustained growth over an extended period. In Q3, however, billings of $1.49 billion represented growth of 6% as we experienced 1 month shorter contract duration and importantly, lackluster appliance demand resulting from elevated product growth in earlier periods. In terms of industry verticals, education and government buildings were strong, while service provider and retail buildings were weak. Small enterprise billings growth was strong, while growth rates with larger enterprises disappointed. Phil's growth varied by GEO with international emerging showing strong growth, while our much larger GEOs of Europe and the U.S. were weaker. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue of 16% Prometal revenue grew 16% to $1.33 billion which compares to our 3-year CAGR of 27%. The 3-year CAGR was largely consistent with our 14-year CAGR illustrated on Slide 18. Product revenue of $466 million, representing a 3-year CAGR of 28% was down 1%, reflecting product lead times and backlog aligning with historical levels and the lighter levels of network security demand can refer to. Service revenues of $869 million grew 28%, representing a 3-year CAGR of 27%. Service revenue accounted for 65% of total revenues driven by 34% growth in higher-margin security subscriptions which represents 57% of total service revenue. We mentioned the 3-year CAGR to illustrate how consistent they are. With the same CAGR starting from our 2009 IPO which were illustrated on Slide 18, each of the 3-year CAGRs, billings, product revenue, service revenue and total revenue are within 5 points of the 14-year CAGR for the same top line metrics, adding to our confidence in returning to higher growth levels. Product gross margins were down 310 basis points as we saw margin pressure related to inventory levels. Service gross margin was up 60 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced higher levels of cloud and hosting costs. Total gross margin of 76.9% was up 70 basis points driven by the increase in service gross margins and the 6-point shift from product revenue to service revenue. Operating margin of 27.8% exceeded the high end of the guidance range and operating income of $371 million was $33 million higher than consensus and $20 million above the high on the high end of our guidance range, reflecting our efforts to control spending. Looking to the statement of cash flow, summers on Slides 15 through 17. Free cash flow increased 22% to $481 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 36% or 9 points above consensus. Operating cash flow increased $68 million to 41% of revenue. Capital expenditures of $70 million, including $50 million of real estate investments. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $26 million. As a reminder, free cash flow benefited from regulatory relief in the form of deferred estimated and other tax payments in the second and third quarters, totaling $192 million and $18 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect cash taxes to total $345 million, including the $210 million of deferred tax payments. We repurchased 10.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $605 million in the third quarter. In October, we purchased an additional 7.7 million shares for $444 million. And our remaining share repurchase authorization stood at approximately $980 million at the end of October. Now I'd like to share a couple of key SASE wins for us in the quarter. In a 7-figure upsell win an existing financial services customer initiated their single vendor SASE solution for 50,000 users. Fortinet was able to displace another incumbent as the customer continue their consolidation journey with us, supplementing their earlier SecOps, cloud and network security purchases. And in a 6-figure deal, an existing SD-WAN customer continued their strategic transition to SaaS and cloud-based applications by adding our SASE solution for 2,000 users. We believe existing SD-WAN customers such as this one, offer a rich cross-sell opportunity for our SASE solution. It's worth noting these deals closed before our recently announced partnership with Google Cloud which significantly expands our PoP coverage by adding over 100 locations and prior to Gartner's release of the inaugural single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant, where we were named a challenger. By 2025, 1/3 of new SASE deployments are expected to be single vendor. I should also note Fortinet is recognized in 9 Gardner Magic Quadrants as shown on Slide 3. Now I'd like to expand on Ken's strategic commentary with some of the tactical investments we're making to increasingly focus our efforts on SASE and SecOps in the areas of research and development and solution delivery, in addition to the new Google Cloud partnership I just mentioned and our own data center investments, we're continuing to integrate single SASE features into 40s [ph] and continuing to expand our SecOp capabilities with AI technology and additional functions in enhanced integration. And finalizing co-development agreements with existing large enterprise customers to accelerate continuous improvement of our integrated enterprise level SASE solution. Our go-to-market strategy, our investments include actively promoting our challenger position in Gartner a single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant, focusing on third-party certification of our broad and integrated solutions. Including SSE and SD-WAN and aggressively marketing Fortinet competitive advantages and the key components of SASE, SecOps and network security as summarized on Slide 10. Certifying 5,500 foot net sales professional of SecOps solutions after all ready certifying these same sellers in SASE which is the largest sales enablement motion in company history. Investing in sales comp plans to include incentives to sell SASE and SecOps capabilities to existing and new customers. Expanding partner roles deeper into channel partners specializing in SASE and SecOps. And developing channel training and is focused on differentiating Fortinet's is comprehensive and integrated SASE and SecOps capabilities. We believe Fortinet remains well positioned in the cybersecurity market and the market shift to platform strategies is in early stages. According to Gartner, 75% of companies are pursuing a vendor consolidation strategy, reflecting the evolving landscape of cybersecurity in a highly fragmented industry with thousands of vendors. As shown on Slide 9, Pertinent brings consolidation across SecOps, SASE and network security the 3 key growth drivers in our strategy. Organizations are recognizing that an integrated security solution with a single operating system is the best method to improve their security posture as this approach allows each security solution to share data and communicate with each other, reducing complexity and improving security effectiveness. Attending to piece together best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors can result in slower AI-driven technology adoption, significant security gaps and a slower pace of identifying, reporting and resolving security incidents. Moving to guidance. we continue to see increased deal scrutiny and longer sales cycles which is constraining our near-term results. We expect these longer sales cycles to continue along with the associated budgetary scrutiny and our fourth quarter guidance takes us into consideration. As a reminder, our fourth quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 20 and 21, is subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. In the fourth quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.560 billion to $1.700 billion which at the midpoint represents a decline of 5%. Revenue in the range of $1.380 billion to $1.440 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% to 76.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 27.5% to 28.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.44 which assumes a share count of between 780 million to 790 million; capital expenditures of $40 million to $60 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And cash taxes, as I mentioned, are $345 million [ph]. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.095 billion to $6.235 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. The Revenue in the range of $5.270 billion to $5.330 billion which is the midpoint represents growth of 20%. Service revenue range of $3.355 billion to $3.375 billion which at the midpoint represents a growth of 28%. The service revenue guidance implies product revenue growth of 9%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76% to 77% and non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% to 27.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 to $1.56 which assumes a share count of between 790 million and 800 million. Capital expenditures of $220 million to $240 million; non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $430 million. As we look forward to 2024 and transition from a period of elevated product growth, we can offer a few thoughts looking forward. In the near term, we will continue to focus on improving profitability. We expect product gross margins to be pressured in 2024. Nonetheless, we expect healthy operating margins that are 25% or greater. We expect to gradually increase billings growth through the year and approach double-digit growth by the second half of 2024, reflecting the progressively easier comps due to the easing of the headwind and from backlog draws in the first half of 2023 and the benefit of our SASE and SecOps focus. We expect contract term to remain below our high water marks of 2022. We Consistent with prior years, we expect that the timing of service revenue growth trends will lag product growth trends. Longer term, we remain confident in our solutions and our ability to adopt our strategy to shifts in the market. taking market share as we increase our investments in SASE and SecOps, ultimately returning to balanced growth and profitability. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A. Peter Salkowski : Operator -- as a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Operator, you can open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Hamza Fodderwala : Ken, maybe just for you. To what extent are you seeing SASE start to eat into firewall and network security budgets? Because clearly, there's a bigger focus there. There is a dedicated go-to-market effort there. So -- do you think that SASE is starting to cannibalize the firewall market to some degree? Ken Xie : I think it's a little bit different business model. SASE is more the service OpEx compared to the networking dip CapEx, during the slow economy environment, customers definitely move towards service-based OpEx. So it will be also since some of service providers kind of a little bit slower to adopt some of the SASE that -- we have been involved in SASE a long time. And some of the service provider kind of slower than we expected. So that's where we kind of changed some of the strategy more aggressively going ourselves at the same time, still working closely with the partner. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Brian Essex : I guess maybe, Keith, for you, as we look at the trajectory of product declines this quarter in billings growth -- and I guess guidance implies that this is a billings trough this quarter. What observations might you have from other, we'll call them, spending cycles where you've hit negative product or low single-digit product revenue growth and a degree of recovery that you've seen after those spending cycles? And what gives you the level of confidence in your ability to, I guess, return to double-digit growth for either product or billings or both in the second half, understanding you're going to have easier comps as well? Keith Jensen : Yes. Brian, great question, I should say. One of the slides that we added to the investor presentation for this earnings call actually maps out the what you can see is a cycle -- more cyclical nature of the business than maybe we've talked about in the past with product revenue. For example, in 2017, I think we had product revenue growth of 5% and that was somewhat of a low watermark. The market may have been due and I think there's some analyst studies out there from other members of Wall Street that have kind of suggested that the market was due for a little bit of a pause in firewalls. And I think we're seeing that now. And perhaps there was some delay of that pause because of supply chain issues and so forth, something that may have more naturally occurred in 2021 or in 2022. I think in terms of confidence, broadly, I think that was the intention of looking at the CAGRs and the success of the company that Canada has led the company through since its IPO and what those CAGRs are. And if you look at that combined with that new slide in the deck, you understand that there's going to be -- there has been the past been volatility in the industry and in the company. But over the longer stretch, you see some very attractive CAGRs in that. Ken Xie : Long term, we still don't believe the convergence of network into network security will be happening which also valid by like [indiscernible], by 2030 the network security secure networking will be larger than the traditional networking, especially in the compass environment, in the enterprise. And so we do believe it's a huge market opportunity. We have a unique advantage with our integrated operating system with our ASIC acceleration, we are keeping gaining market share in both network and also in the SASE market. Operator : Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Fatima Boolani : Keith, in your prepared commentary, you specifically called out the service provider and retail vertical perhaps exceptionally weak in their buying. And Ken was just sort of alluding to some of the challenges that are stemming from service provider buying behavior -- but I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail as to why have the spending patterns in these particular verticals become so dramatically weak -- and was this in the scope of your assumptions as you were thinking about the pipe? Just wanted to get a better understanding of how and why the buying intentions have sort of rolled over in these 2 areas specifically? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the service provider commentary has probably been reported by a number of other companies through this earnings cycle. I don't think that's -- the headline itself is not a surprise. I think the significance of the slowdown in the service provider, at least for what we saw in our business was a surprise, particularly because it's a worldwide service provider number, not just in the U.S. But as I also noted in the prepared comments, we saw weakness in both the U.S. and the Europe, European markets. and that applies to service provider and to the retail sector. I think the retail sector probably is perhaps a little bit more prone to some of the digestion of SD-WAN projects that are still working their way through and maybe that's a little bit different. As well as some of the economic headlines were probably a little bit disconcerting to the retail sector in the earlier part of the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Tal Liani from BofA. Tal Liani : Thank you. I have 2 questions on the same topic. If you go back to the last 2 years, you talked a lot about non-appliance sales, meaning upsell SD-WAN which is a head on service and then non-FortiGate. And when things start to slow, we only blame the appliances. So the question is in retrospect, when you look at things and you look at the other parts of the business and you look at the add-on sales and the other features, are they all based on you -- the ability of us selling appliances, meaning even if it's a non-FortiGate, it's being attached to a FortiGate sale and that's why it's going down with it or an SD-WAN, et cetera. So first, just to understand kind of the total exposure of the company from all the successful products that you were able to sell over the last 2 years and now in retrospect, just to understand how is the exposure to appliance? And the next -- the second question which is related to it is if really it's about applying sales, what is the outlook for 2024 when it comes to do you have any big refresh cycle what could drive outside of easy comps that our comps are getting easier through the year? Is there anything that you're planning on your end to drive some kind of a replacement or a refresh of the appliances? Ken Xie : Yes, it's Ken. I think for SD-WAN, they do need a place to be in place to deliver all these SD-WAN functions there. We really offer SD-WAN as part of the [indiscernible] Function for free and we started launching the SD-WAN service last quarter. So it's still in the ramp-up stage. We do believe one to all the service, we're keeping accelerating like the SASE market will be growing faster than the secure networking market. I think that's where for certain like -- I think there's a chunk on the presentation shows some of the product and service which is in on Page 19, you can see some of the cycle up and down there. Also, some of I do believe relate to the new ASIC and also product launch because we just started the new cycle of the new ISP5 [ph]; we have a one or two product as starting launching which gave us like a 5 to 10x better performance and more function at the same cost. Which also combined with the supply chain kind of elevated shipment of building in the last 2, 3 years. Because it's combined together, I feel have affected our price sales in the last few months. But I do believe this since we'll go back to normal probably in second half of next year. After the new product being fully launched after the supply digestion but inventory directions kind of go through because we do see the long-term convergence story is still holding well. We have a big position with better integrated OS with salvation. And our plan as a part of the whole solution. It's a hybrid solution, both our part cloud, especially we call the universal SASE. So that's -- there's some kind of cycle, if you refer to the Page 19 of the presentation, we kind of probably go through that cycle right now. Keith Jensen : Yes, Tal, I'll maybe add to Ken's comments. I think you're correct in that, your interest that the vast majority of the time, our first sales to customers a firewall. It can be a virtual firewall or it could be a physical appliance. And really, that is the beachhead that then go sell these other security functions and products. I think what you're seeing is in part of the shift of strategy and we talk about making the investments in note SASE but also SecOps. It's really that SecOps product family like EDR and SIM and so as such, that you're seeing is doubling down on the investments there because while it's not the largest of the 3 market segments, it is the fastest growing. And I think we have the opportunity to participate in those markets more, particularly now that some of our products have reached a greater level of maturity. Operator : Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Ken, I'm going to ask 2 together. So maybe for the first one, Ken, for you. Just maybe thinking about the long term and specifically in the SASE part of the business, when do you feel like Fortinet will have a solution that can compete head-to-head with other SASE solutions? Maybe the answer is now, right but I just want to hear how you think about it. And how big do you think this part of the business can be longer term? That's the first question. The second question for you, Keith, is it's great to see the operating margin being. Maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about sort of midterm profitability -- because clearly, the business can generate higher margins than 25%. How do you sort of think about that balance now kind of given some of the changes here? Ken Xie : Yes. The first answer is, yes, now we are ahead at competing. And we also believe we have a much better solution, better integrated and at the same time, much better cost ROI compared to other competitors of SASE. And also the universal SASE is very unique because they offer both in the cloud, on the plans of Compass all the same solution which allows the customer a more like our solution instead of sometimes you have to deal with traffic, whether enough is office have to fold the part because our solution you can process some traffic locally on campus within their appliance. Keith Jensen : Yes. So you had a great point about whether you're talking about free cash flow, you're talking about operating margin. The company does very, very well on the bottom line. And the strategy has been to continue to reinvest that back robustly in both innovation in the form of R&D spending but also in go-to-market, whether that's marketing, whether that's selling. I think we're looking at right now with the sort of firewall market. Obviously, we're trying to bring new solutions to better solutions to our sellers to sell when the firewall is a little bit slower. But I do think it's a workout conversation and looking at the sales coverage, if you will. We've talked for several years about how many -- in North America, for example, how many accounts do we want per rep. We started with 65, I think, 4 or 5 years ago. We were talking about that. That number is now down to 10. And at 10, you're probably reaching a point of where you're -- on the enterprise side, you're probably reaching a pretty good coverage model for our business. You could probably go a little bit lower but that feels pretty good. I think there's another opportunity right now immediately in front of us in terms of how do we continue to support our channel partners, be they distributors or be they resellers and make sure that we're getting the right level of mind share from them. So I would suspect there will be some investments in that part of the business as we go forward. At the same time, I think there's some opportunities here and Ken's talked about it with us about how to be more efficient in how we're spending our money, whether that's in selling and marketing or back office functions or what have you. So -- we're not trying to guide to 2024 today, obviously but we did think that it was important to provide at least some early thoughts in terms of maybe a floor for what 2024 should look like for us on the bottom line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. I appreciate that as you lean into SASE and security operations, your most obvious advantage is in having an industry-leading installed base. But for those of us that have always viewed Fortinet's distinct advantage is the price performance of your purpose-built hardware and you've also had a go to market, both direct and indirect that know how to showcase that. I'm just trying to get my head around all the changes in distribution, both direct and indirect which I appreciate, Keith, you made comments about sales enablement. But how do you think about the investment in dollars in time needed to get distribution properly ramped? And can you ever achieve the same level of sales productivity that you've enjoyed when the motion was more box-centric? Ken Xie : We do believe in this fast-growing SASE SecOps market, the sales training, sales restructuring. At the same time, more efficient marketing is very, very important. And also, we are continue working closely with our channel partner with our distribution network to reaching more broad customer base. So we're also thinking the large cross-sell opportunity is huge and especially go through our partner network there. So I don't feel the investment we've made in the past will be any issue or kind of any slow us down. We do believe we are actually helping us to expand in this more service basis SASE market and also more consolidation secure approach. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I would just build on Ken's comment, Brad and all good and fair questions. It's not by accident. We're talking about SASE. If you go back and think about it a little bit, we've been talking about it and in a number of different ways, Ken has talked about the PoP strategy which now you see us accelerating that PoP strategy with the cloud providers to come to market more quickly. The Gartner Magic Quadrant, I think, of the catalyst for the single vendor strategy and having us in the challenger quadrant gives us the bonafides if you will, to have a lot of conversations. The single vendor strategy, that installed base that you referred to, we went back and looked over the last 2 quarters, we've done several hundred SASE deals already. And to be quite honest, that was without any real wood behind the arrow in terms of marketing support and sales support. It was really just how it grew. And it's interesting. I would have expected those first sales that would have been clearly dominated by SD-WAN. They were not SD-WAN customers. They were often times, there were just as many brand new customers coming to us for the SASE solution as they were SD-WAN customers or somewhere and at the third part of the pie were customers that are bars for other firewall use cases. So, I don't -- in the expectation that our -- we're going to be successful initially in the smaller part of the market. I don't think we disagree with that. When I look at that same mix of SASE customers, nearly 50% of those SASE customers that we signed already would be in the SMB space. And then, the remainder was kind of divided up between the larger enterprises and the mid-enterprise. So, I don't think we got here by accident. We maybe just not to talk about it publicly but I think we're well positioned now because of the investments that we've made in the data centers, the PoPs, the operating system like Gartner Magic Quadrant, the fact in a single vendor in the installed base. I think this is the right strategic shift for us to make at this point. Brad Zelnick : And just a quick follow-up and I know it's a topic we've spoken about in the past. But as SASE increases as part of the mix? And I know strategically, you've partnered with Google to help deliver the infrastructure. How should we think about the CapEx required to do this in a competitive way over the longer term? Ken Xie : We do have a good partnership with Google. At the same time, some other service providers like digital royalty. And we also built some of our own like data center PoP over 30 owned by ourself which has really given us a more cost advantage. So we're containing that strategy but as do need time to ramp up. So Google is a very quick solution for us, for customers. And also, we feel we separate -- we kind of realign the market into 3 different segments. Secure networking, SASE and SecureOp is much clearer, much better lineup with the customer need and also with different customer demand. So that's much better, more clear compared to the previous one we have whether the FortiGate or some other like enhanced non-FortiGate product. We feel this is a clear 3 segment line up quite well with the customer demand. So we're starting tracking based on this one, also we started compensate sales and the train sales and marketing along these 3 separate segments of the market. That will be more clearly to us internal for customers to a partner to very kind of drive what customers really need in the current environment. Keith Jensen : To Ken's point, look, we were -- last quarter, we were talking about 20 PoPs because we're building them ourselves, right? Now you're talking about over 100 locations, well over 100 locations. So I think there's a go-to-market opportunity there that this brings to us. I think longer term -- and we know that one of our competitors, this is the approach they take and we have pretty good visibility, obviously, to what their margins are and their investments there. And there's another player in the space that's much more building their own PoPs, if you will. PoPs individually are not huge things, right? I mean they are single-digit number of racks that really have a PoP, I think. So I do believe you need some forward-stage data centers. And I think that's consistent with our strategy that we've talked about, about increasing more and more hosted delivery services and particularly in SecOps. So I think this is not something that we're going to surprise people with in terms of our CapEx spending. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Keith, it sounds like you're confident in profitability and free cash flow which makes sense. Obviously, the model has proved itself over the years. So I wanted to ask about capital allocation. The balance sheet is already very healthy. You've got a lot of capacity. Right now, the market is pivoting towards universal SASE and SecOps, as you mentioned. Curious how the conversations have gone internally to potentially accelerate your pivot towards that with larger M&A. And conversely, if we look at the after-hours action here, the ROI on share repurchase is looking potentially very strong the opportunity to potential step up share repurchases? Just in general, how you're thinking about using the balance sheet as a weapon during a time where the business and stock is pressured? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think we included a comment in the -- in my prepared remarks that the available -- we still have -- as of the start of the month, start of the week, I guess, we had $980 million of available authorization for the buyback. And I think you saw some of the numbers that we provided in the prepared remarks about being fairly aggressive during the quarter itself as well in terms of buying back stock. Canada so let me go shopping for companies very often. So I'll defer to him in terms of his thoughts on that. Ken Xie : We're definitely keeping looking. I think right now, the multiple probably more reasonable than the last 1 to 2 years. And also, we do realize the marketing also changing pretty quick. We'll continue to do the internal innovation. We feel we are the strongest on the internal innovation engineering among all the space, player. But on the same time, we also were open to looking for some other companies which we can work together, join together. Adam Tindle : Okay. And one quick follow-up, just to make sure Peter kicks me off the call next time for this one. But it will be in the weeds, Keith, sorry. I want to ask about supply. We've been monitoring inventory commitments. They've been elevated for a little while now. Obviously, demand is deteriorating faster than expected. And we're just trying to think about how to manage inventory and future inventory given this new state of demand. where that might manifest itself in results. I think you mentioned product gross margin pressure. I wonder if that was related to that. But any comments on kind of managing this oncoming inventory relative to the current demand? Keith Jensen : Yes, it is related to the inventory levels. And I think we've been managing it for the better part of the second half of this year. And that's some of the commentary you're getting as we look into 2024 in terms of where the pressure may come from. Adam Tindle : Any way to quantify it though? Keith Jensen : Quantify, no. Ken Xie : Yes, we feel still in a healthy level and we tend to keep about 6 months' inventory. That's where like when 2, 3 years ago, the supply chain should happen, we are in market position because also a lot of time, our customer need some urgent delivery of certain products. So we're probably still keeping the similar policy there. but also we're in a refresh cycle of our new products, especially end. I think so far, we -- I think we also kind of resurprised in the last 2, 3 years. now since starting to stabilize and so changing from a shortage a little bit more towards even some oversupplied. So we feel we are in a pretty good position because we more handle is operation manufacturer directly. So we handle it better than most of our other competitors on the inventory right now. Yes, we also don't see a big issue about the current inventory level. Operator : Next question comes from Adam Borg from Stifel. Adam Borg : Maybe just on the sales execution issues that you talked about in the script, maybe go a little deeper on what exactly -- what exactly happened and a little bit more about the steps you're taking. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on the SASE partnership with [ GCT ]. I know it's obviously just been a couple of weeks but maybe talk about early customer feedback from initial conversations? Ken Xie : Yes. We -- if you look in the last 2, 3 years, we're growing a lot of business also hired a lot of salespeople -- and the last 2, 3 years, we probably doubled the business. And at the same time, during the supply chain, you should somehow certain sales feel it too easy to get deal because as always a shortage of certain product there. So that's where we feel we need to enhance the training enablement and -- at the same time, I also need to be more disciplined about the performance. So that's -- at the same time, we also -- when we're shifting this to more like a service-based SASE kind of consolidation cross-sell multi-cell secure part sales also need to keep in learning. At the same time, the market need to be kind of more efficient and also kind of a projection to the new growth opportunity. So that's the focus we have right now. So we are definitely keeping looking to be more efficient in both the sales and marketing going forward. Adam Borg : Great. And what about the early feedback on [indiscernible]. Ken Xie : Yes, it's very good that give us a very quick start to match any other competitor on the location, number of [indiscernible] number up and they also have a broad coverage, so it's a good partnership. At the same time, we continue to working with some other partners. We also will continue to build ourselves. And the long term, we feel we have more advantage than some of our competitors because we always have a strategy invest in some long-term or long-term investment strategy, including some real estate, some other parts which give us a much better long-term return. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Scotia Bank. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Ken, Keith, Peter. My question is about being, I guess, kind of qualitative guidance you guys gave for 2024 billings. If I remember correctly, in last quarter, it was expect kind of high teens busing growth exiting fiscal '24. Was the commentary this quarter expect double-digit growth exiting 2024? Keith Jensen : Let's try I'm following the math. Unidentified Analyst : I'm just trying to -- so last quarter, you guys gave some kind of like a forward look for 2024 billings. And if I remember rightly, the kind of forward look was expect exiting billings growth to be in high teens. Earlier in your kind of prepared remarks, there was a comment which was expect double-digit growth in the second half. I guess -- are we going from high teens to double digit? Is that the change? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think that's prudent given what we've just seen in terms of the third quarter performance. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Gallo from Jefferies. Joseph Gallo : I've got a two-parter, one for each of you. And Keith, as a follow-up to that last question, appreciate the commentary on bottom line floor for '24. Can you just talk about the methodology of top line guidance? Is this a rip the Band-Aid off guide? Or what underpins the confidence and visibility on a reacceleration of billings. Is it SASE turning on or just hardware digestion only taking 2 to 3 quarters? And then, Ken, given what you're seeing with AI, do you believe adoption of AI workloads eventually shift workloads back to on-premise and drives a higher need for firewalls long term? Keith Jensen : Yes. And I wasn't quite sure if the question was about the Q4 guide or the 2024 commentary about numbers. Joseph Gallo : More for next year but both. Has the methodology for your top line guidance change following the past 2 quarters? Keith Jensen : Yes. I would say that, while we just deal with actually giving guidance for the fourth quarter, Absolutely. I think the assumed close rates, if you will, are dramatic. I think they're the lowest assumed close rates I've seen that I've used in over 5 years here for context. And they're obviously lower than what I saw in the -- what I used for the first half of the year. And I think that -- I would say there are indicators that the pipeline quality is better in the fourth quarter. But in given light of what we've done for the last 2 quarters, I don't think that should put much stock in that. So I'm content to just assume a much lower close rate than I have more recently. 2024 are not really giving guidance. I think that, again, we're talking about buildings here and I know we're all aware of it but really focus perhaps more on the impact of backlog and what it did to billings in Q1 of last year and Q2 of last year and how that eased throughout the year. So you're really going to see comps change I don't know that we're necessarily assuming a dramatic growth ramp of bookings, if you will, at this early stage for 2024. We do expect it's going to improve as we bring SASE online more successfully and secure operations. But I think it's really part of what you're hearing there is really getting clarity on how the backlog impacted 2023 numbers. Ken Xie : Yes. it's a very good interesting question about the AI and the security. I have to see definitely AI, we're starting kind of getting the security more quickly, both by that good guy bad guy. But in the genetic AI side, I feel, in some degree, the back a probably more leverage some of that one and the Protect side, still more using what we have been doing in the last 10, 20 years, more like a precision AI and make sure we block the type of not blocking traffic but also to generate -- also helping the porting cost and also helping the secure operation. So it's definitely the AI, we're keeping driving the security growth and both in the cloud and also our appliance. We do see our plans also long term very healthy growth, especially we cause convergence of networking to networking security, especially in enterprise, in the compass environment. And we see that trend will continue to grow well and our unique advantage leverage integrated ASIC will continue to lead in the market and keeping gaining market share. So long term, I don't see any slowdown of the appliance to get into the cybersecurity space. Operator : Our next question comes from Gray Powell from BTIG. Gray Powell : All right. Great. Thank you for working in here. I really appreciate it. So maybe a clarification and a follow-up. So you laid out the breakdown for billings or the new breakdown between secure networking, SASE and SecOps. Did you all talk about the relative growth rates that you're seeing today for each segment? And then within secured networking, is there a way to think about how much of the slowdown you're seeing there is related to the core firewall business versus some of the networking components like switches and access points and stuff that may have been more -- that may have benefited more from like supply chain and budget flush and things like that? Ken Xie : Yes. Actually, we do give the market growth for these 3 segments going forward. And we also believe we're growing faster than the market growth, gaining share in all the 3 segments. Related to the firewall FortiGate versus some other AP switch. We do see more headwind in AP switch for the AP switch because a lot of supply chain issues kind of pretty much over. And so it's -- so that's probably more headwind compared to the firewall secure networking for side. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Heath from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Eric Heath : Great. And thanks, Peter, for getting me in here. Keith, just for you, curious how the economics to the top line for Fortinet change when a customer is kind of doing an apples-to-apples switch over from kind of the firewall customer over to SASE. And then secondarily, with the shift away from farewell, that probably means more of a shift to annualized billings. So curious how you're thinking about duration and that impact to free cash flow going forward? Keith Jensen : Yes. The second one is probably easier. I don't -- we have such a large footprint right now in the firewall business that it's going to take a while for any significant changes in the SASE billings if you really think about it coming into and having an impact on our total term. I don't know that we gave the number but we know that we've come back to a more. We're coming down about a month year-over-year in terms of contract term in 2023 compared to 2022, we went from 28 months roughly last year to about 27 months this year. Maybe I could be off by a month. And you saw the impact in the financials. We've talked about that will one month impacts the billings number. I think it's going to take a while for SASE. As I mentioned, we've already done several under SASE deals. We expect to be more successful early on with 1 in SMB spaces and two, with our installed base. So I would imagine that but it's going to take a while to really have an impact on free cash flow. Ken Xie : Yes, we also will be keeping salaried training for internal sales force also to our partner for this new SASE SecOp operation which is a little bit different than the traditional secure networking side. So that we also feel the -- with a huge installation base. We have SD-WAN firewall which we're leading. We're number one pretty much in all this area, we feel the huge potential to upsell cross-sell the SASE and secure up once the sales force unevens the partner for the train. Operator : At this time, the Q&A session has now ended. I will now turn the call over to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Anton.

Ken Xie : Thank you, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. In Q4, total billing grow 8.5% to $1.9 billion, driven by increased focus on Secure Op, SASE, and improved execution for our sales team. We closed six eight-figure deals across five industry verticals. All six of these transactions, including all three of our SASE, Secure Ops, and secure networking solutions [Indiscernible] our value of an integrated platform and that span across on-premise and cloud, as well as our FortiASIC technology advantages. Putting a total addressable market across secure op, SASE, and secure networking, expect an increase from $150 billion in 2024 to $208 billion by 2027. Our customer base consists of 76% of Fortune 100, including nine of the top 10 technology companies, nine of the top 10 manufacturers, and nine of the top 10 healthcare. Our Secure Ops billing grow 44%, accounted for 11% of total billing, with strong performance from several solutions, including EDR, SIEM, email security, and NDR, to automatically detect, investigate, and respond to threats. Unified SASE billing grow 19%, accounted for 21% of total billing. We believe Fortinet is the only company with a Unified SASE solution, all integrated into a single FortiOS, that including a full networking and security stack, consisting of a market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, secure web gateway, CASB, and firewall as a service, designed for on-premise and cloud. Our FortiSASE solution is gaining momentum quickly, as we closed our first eight-figure SASE deal for 350,000 seats. In Q4, we added 40 new features to our SASE solution, including support for over 150 PoP location worldwide, and the ability to protect thin edge device. We see a huge opportunity to attach FortiSASE to our tens of thousands SD-WAN customers. Secure networking accounts for 60% of billing, and represent our largest addressable market. Gartner expects the secure networking market to overtake the traditional networking market by 2030. Fortinet is the number one network security vendor, with over half the global firewall deployment. In addition to physical firewall, we offer virtual, cloud native, and firewall as a service solution, all based on our FortiOS operation system, consolidate over 30 networking and security functions together. Converged security and networking require more specialized computing power than traditional networking. Our FortiASIC power, FortiGate, delivers 3x to 10x more performance as indicated by secure computing region with every new FortiGate product release. The latest FortiASIC SP5, based on FortiGate 70G, with dual 5G in ruggedized format, secure device within operation technology environment. It is off a great start as a Fortune 50 company signed a eight figure operation technology deal, feature this new FortiGate in the fourth quarter. Also included with our FortiOS operation system is a Forti featured access point controller. Recently, we announced a new secure access point product, making us the first vendor to announce a business grade Wi-Fi 7 product. Fortinet has consistently been an innovative cybersecurity company, and this earning call won't be complete without a few words about our AI. We have invested heavily in AI across every function and product. For over a decade, Fortinet has used machine learning and AI to provide advanced threat intelligence across more than 40 products from network, endpoint, and application security. Our solution applies AI and machine learning across expanded digital tech service automatically, containing and remediating incident within seconds, where the industry average for detection and remediation takes several days. We have also been applying Gen AI technology across our entire product line, allowing customers to optimize the security effectiveness and operation efficiency. FortiAI is already available on FortiSIEM and FortiSOAR and more product will be adding this function in the coming months. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their continuous support and hard work. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As Ken mentioned, billings grew 8.5%, driven by improved sales execution and early returns on our SASE and SecOp investments. The quarter benefited from what we saw as a muted seasonal budget flush and certain deals that had pushed from earlier quarters, closing in the fourth quarter, driving a record six transactions, each of which were over $10 million. For these exceptionally large transactions, secure networking was 75% of the billings mix, while SecOps and SASE combined for another 20% plus, illustrating these companies' long-term commitment to both firewall and consolidation strategies. Taking a closer look at three of these eight-figure deals, one of these deals included mid-seven figures for SecOps and another mid-seven figures for SASE. The SASE solution covers a planned 350,000 user deployment at a top U.S. school district to provide a safe learning environment for students, regardless of their physical location. We won this deal because of our operating system's ability to integrate 30-plus networking and security functions across SecOps, SASE, and secure networking into a single, unified platform, providing consistent policies and automated responses. Our vision encompasses creating a secure foundation for our customers, allowing them to navigate today's evolving digital landscape with confidence while empowering them to embrace innovation without compromising security. Illustrating this vision, in another eight-figure deal, a large U.S. enterprise selected Fortinet to support their hybrid cloud architecture as they transition more of their workloads to the cloud. This competitive displacement reduced complexity and the customers' total cost of ownership while showcasing our ability to consolidate security functions onto our FortiOS platform. In a third eight-figure win, a large financial institution in the U.S. expanded their partnership with us with their first enterprise agreement with Fortinet. This EA includes the recently announced FortiGate Rugged 70G to secure their remote working and ATM environments. Built with AI-powered security, the Rugged 70G brings our customers the latest secure networking innovations while at the same time simplifying infrastructure and driving efficiencies. In addition to exceeding the customer's performance expectations in a multi-vendor bake-off, we were successful by demonstrating the versatility of our single operating system and FortiOS platform across multiple use cases. Over the past several years, we have successfully addressed large customer buying preferences by increasing our investments in EA programs. In the fourth quarter, these contracts represented nearly 10% of our billings, with a three-year CAGR of over 80%. Today, with over 35% of our billings beyond traditional and sometimes cyclical firewalls, Fortinet has become an increasingly diversified business over the past decade. Most recently, the diversification has included prioritizing investments in SASE, SecOps, and other software and cloud-based solutions. A key element of this diversification is our single operating system strategy. FortiOS is the foundation of our comprehensive and innovative solutions that drive the convergence of networking and security while also consolidating multiple security capabilities. Attempting to piece together best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors can result in significant security gaps, slower AI-driven technology adoption, and a slower pace of identifying, reporting, and resolving security incidents. Organizations increasingly recognize that an integrated security solution run by a single operating system is the best way to improve their security posture. Consolidation allows security solutions to share data and communicate with each other, reducing complexity, improving security effectiveness, easing the need for skilled labor, and lowering the total cost of ownership. Consolidation drove our SecOps business to 44% growth, with strong growth from EDR, SIEM, email security, and NDR. Importantly, 94% of our SecOps business was from existing customers, as companies looked to execute their vendor consolidation strategy with Fortinet. Digging a little deeper into the 11% of billings that SecOps contributed to our business, the mid-enterprise segment is growing the fastest as these companies respond to the cybersecurity labor shortage and look to reduce complexity. Geographically, international emerging is leading the way for SecOps, likely reflecting stronger economic conditions and extending the success of their 2022 pilot project. Extending the single operating system and consolidation strategy further, our single vendor SASE solution, billings increased 19% and accounted for 21% of total billings. Our SASE pipeline is up over 150% as more of our sales reps are building pipeline. As expected, the SMB segment was the largest mix of SASE customers at 55%, increasing eight points quarter-over-quarter. Fortinet has one of the least complex and most customer-friendly SASE pricing models. Our one bundle and one operating system solution provides all the standard capabilities, including secure web gateway and firewall as a service for secure internet access, Zero Trust Network Access and SD-WAN from our points of presence, providing secure private access, as well as CASB and data loss protection. Our single vendor SASE solution also includes integration to SOC as a service and FortiClient, which provides a customer with endpoint protection and vulnerability scanning. Regarding our focus and investments in SASE and SecOps, SD-WAN customers represented 37% of new SASE customers. Over 90% of our global sales force has completed mandatory sales training for both SASE and SecOps. In 2023, 60,000 customers and partners attended at least one of our 27 training workshops. Lastly, we've increased our worldwide points of presence coverage to over 150 locations. Turning now to the quarterly financial results, total billings were $1.86 billion, up 8.5%, driven by improved sales execution and a strong rebound in the large enterprise segment, together with 6,400 new logos. On a billings-by-geo basis, the U.S. led the way with mid-teens growth driven by strong performance in the U.S. enterprise. In terms of industry verticals, government and financial services, each with growth of approximately 25% were our top two industry verticals, while service provider and retail remained under pressure. The average contract term was 30 months, up two months year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusting for the six eight-figure deals, the normalized contract term was consistent year-over-year and sequentially at 28 months. Turning to revenue and margins, total revenue grew 10% to $1.42 billion, driven by strong services revenue growth. Service revenue of $927 million grew 25%, accounting for 66% of total revenue, a mixed shift of eight points. Service revenue growth was driven by strength in SecOps, SASE, and other security subscriptions. Product bookings were up, however product revenue decreased 10% to $488 million due to a tough compare. Product revenue grew 43% in the prior year period, benefiting from the drawdown of backlog. Total gross margin of 78.5% was up 90 basis points and exceeded the high end of the guidance range by 200 basis points, driven by the increase in service gross margin and the eight-point mixed shift from product revenue to service revenue. Service gross margins were up 140 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor costs and benefited from the mixed shift towards higher margin security subscription services. Product gross margins were down 510 basis points as we continued to see margin pressure related to inventory levels and product transitions. Operating margin was very strong at 32%, three and a half points above the high end of our guidance range and operating income of $454 million was $40 million above the high end of the implied guidance range, reflecting aggressive cost management. Looking to the state of the cash flow, summarized on slides 17 and 19, total cash taxes paid in the quarter were $341 million. Including $210 million estimated tax payments that were deferred from earlier quarters in accordance with U.S. and California one-time regulatory relief, resulting in free cash flow of $165 million. Capital expenditures were $27 million. We repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares at a cost of $895 million for an average cost per share of $53.29. Moving to an overview of our 2023 full year results, billing surpassed the $6 billion mark, totaling $6.4 billion and up 14%. Total revenue grew 20% to $5.3 billion, and we added over 25,000 new customers. Service revenue grew 28% to $3.4 billion, driven by a 33% increase in security subscriptions. Product revenue grew 8% to $1.9 billion, on a very tough compare after going 42% in 2022. Gross margin was up 110 basis points to 77.4%, benefiting from the revenue mix shift to service revenue. Operating margin also increased 110 basis points to a calendar year record of 28.4%, resulting in operating income of $1.5 billion. The GAAP operating margin of over 23% continues to be one of the highest in the industry. Earnings per share increased 37% to $1.63. Free cash flow was a record at over $1.7 billion. Free cash flow margin was 33%. Including real estate investments, the adjusted free cash flow margin came in at 35%. For the year, we repurchased approximately 20 million shares at a cost of $1.5 billion, for an average cost per share of $55.25. And to summarize on slide 20, Fortinet has returned $5.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases in the past three years. Earlier this year, the board increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $500 million, bringing our remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $1 billion. Moving on to guidance. As we look to 2024, several factors impact guidance, including the firewall industry cycle, remnants of 2022 and 2023 supply chain activity, and customer buying behavior. Prior firewall product life cycles have lasted approximately four years, with eight quarters of higher growth followed by eight quarters of slower growth. Looking at our bookings, the current product cycle decline started approximately four quarters ago in Q1 of 2023, suggesting that we should experience the bottom of the cycle in early 2024.suggesting that we should experience the bottom of the cycle in early 2024. Worldwide supply chain challenges resulted in elevated purchasing and record backlog, distorting year-over-year growth comparisons, and creating a period of project and product digestion. The backlog drawdown in the first half of 2023 provided a mid-to-high single-digit percentage tailwind to billings and low double-digit tailwind to product revenue growth for that period. The year-over-year product revenue comparisons in the first half of 2024 will be the most challenged, while we expect service revenues to grow sequentially in the low single digits in the first quarter and to grow sequentially at low to mid-single digits for the remainder of 2024. In addition, we expect product revenue growth will continue to be impacted by project and product digestion in 2024, and we believe the selling environment should improve in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. As a reminder, our first quarter and full year outlook, which are summarized on slides 23 and 24, subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.390 billion to $1.450 billion, which at the midpoint represents a decline of 5.5%, revenue in the range of $1.300 billion to $1.360 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 5.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 26.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.39, which assumes a share count of between $775 million and $785 million. Capital expenditures of $220 million to $250 million including a real estate transaction that closed earlier in the quarter. A non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and cash taxes of $30 million. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion, revenue in the range of $5.715 billion to $5.815 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 9%. Service revenue in the range of $3.920 billion to $3.970 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of 17%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76% to 78%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.5% to 27.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70, which assumes a share count of between $785 million and $795 million. Capital expenditures of $370 million to $420 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and cash taxes of $520 million. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters, and I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Peter Salkowski : Thank you. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Keith, I really appreciate you flushing out some of the factors that are going to be creating volatility in your top-line performance, but what I wanted to focus on was how you are able to hold the line on the expense structure in light of the volatility both on the revenue and billings front. So if you can just help us appreciate how you're able to manage for profitability, and then by extension, these top-line volatilities, how should we think about the free cash flow cadence against your assumptions on the OPEC structure along with the fact that you have seen lumpy, very large deals that have positively influenced duration for now? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think kind of going backwards in terms of the very large deals that we talked about, I think experience has showed us in the second half or the middle part of last year that we're well served not to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of forecasting those deals. And it's difficult to understand when they're actually going to close and what the specific terms are going to be with those. So I think we kind of set those aside, and you saw that in some of the performance in the fourth quarter. In terms of margins, I think that sometimes the business model is easier than people think it is when it comes to margin because services provide so much of the business. If the business model is two-thirds services and it's throwing out a very rich margin, even in a period of time where you're going through the firewall refresh cycle, you're still seeing your margins hold up fairly nicely. I think there's also significant economies of scale involved in the services line, whether it's the support or the security subscriptions. And then the last thing I would offer is that I think the breadth of both the SecOps Solutions and the SASE Solutions together are serving to spread some of the incremental costs for the hosting solutions and bringing those to market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Hamza Fodderwala : Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Ken, over the last several years, we've seen some pretty significant increases in network traffic, whether it be more cloud adoption, more work from home, etcetera, and that's led to pretty healthy firewall refresh over the last several years. I'm curious, and I know it's very early innings, but how do you see sort of the adoption of generative AI, particularly in some of these hybrid contexts, impacting network traffic going forward? And do you think that that's going to incent more firewall refresh to secure that growing network traffic? Thank you. Ken Xie : Long-term, definitely we see that gen AI will increase the traffic a lot and also automate a lot of security operations. We also see the refresh of the firewall cycle. We do provide some kind of a [Indiscernible] data there. But we also see a lot of new opportunity. We now come at the refresh. Like we mentioned in the script, some of the OT technology area and even supporting some work from home and also some other enterprise internal segmentation replacing the traditional switch with a network security firewall that we call the convergence, also starting to get more and more adopted by the big enterprise. So that's also the new market compared to refreshed traditional firewall. But I agree with you, the next phase connection, the traffic will keep increasing, especially more devices will be connected online and also more people will work remotely. And at the same time, the AI also kind of generates quite a lot of additional data, which also kind of need to be secured. So we see a pretty good potential for the long-term growth. Hamza Fodderwala : Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Brian, your line is now open. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you very much. And thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe for Ken, could you dig in a little bit to the SASE performance of the quarter? If I recall correctly, and I don't know what kind of metrics you can break out to give us a little bit more color behind that. But if I recall, you're doing quite well with kind of the SD-WAN component. And we're trying to kind of pivot to better penetrate the secure service edge component. Maybe a little bit of color as you've pivoted towards, I guess, focusing a little bit more on SecOps and SASE what is the nature of the deals look like this quarter? What do you see in the pipeline for SASE? And are you getting better traction with secure service edge? And does that include SD-WAN or is it relatively agnostic to SD-WAN? Thank you. Ken Xie : I think you probably can recall in the last earnings call, we started more focus on SASE SecureOps and started tracking that separately. And also, we also mentioned 90% of our field sales force also being trained certified for SASE SecureOps. And also, all the six eight-figure deals, including all the three, secure networking, SASE and the SecureOps. So, we do see it grow faster, especially during the current kind of environment of refresh cycle. We do see the SASE, which is more consumption model, and also SecureOps, which can lower the operation cost probably faster than the traditional secure networking area. So that's where we kind of redirect some focus, resource, more focus on these two areas. We see a pretty huge success, grow both the pipeline and also even the deal. We closed some of the first eight figure SASE deal, which also makes us feel pretty excited. I think we have some advantage, actually, leverage the SD-WAN huge deployment we have, all the firewalls, huge deployment, and also the single OS-based SASE solution, which integrates all the SD-WAN, all the SASE functions into a single FortiOS, which is a huge advantage for whether the customer themself or even for some service provider, offer the SASE service to their customer base. So it's a pretty strong growth. We see it's a pretty good move we have. Keith Jensen : Yes, Brian, I would kind of follow that up with some of the results, if you will, of what Ken just talked about. And to your point, I think you're kind of asking us, if you focus more on the SSE element of SASE and less on SD-WAN, what does that mean. I think that we have a pretty interesting horse race developing internally, if you look at what you would probably think of as the SSE component and the SecOps business, both growing in the 40% range. SecOps won the quarter. We'll see how SASE does, but they're very, very close at this point in time in terms of growth. And then I think the other metric we gave, we talked about the pipeline growth, and that 150% would really be around what you would think of as the SSE component. Brian Essex : Got it. That's really helpful. We'll keep it to one and keep it efficient, but thank you so much, both of you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal Liani : Hi, guys. I'll ask two questions together. It's easier. CapEx is going up materially next year, this year. What is the outlook for free cash flow margin? What happens to free cash flow this year? Can you actually drill down to the CapEx? What drives the increase? And then what happens to free cash flow margin? The second question I have is on the business. This quarter, billings were supposed to be weak, but they're very strong. Next quarter, we expected roughly 5%, 6% declines, and that's what you're guiding to. So that means maybe there was some pull forward, but kind of in line-is. What happens this quarter that billings is so strong versus expectations? What drove the strength? And why don't we see it continue into the next quarter? Thanks. Keith Jensen : You want to take CapEx or deals? Hi, Tal. How are you? Thanks for calling in. On CapEx, I think we'll continue to build out both things that we need for our engineering team as we look forward, and best places to work and labs and so forth. So I think you're seeing an element of that. But also our ability to continue to deliver the wide range of hosted solutions. I think those are the things that are driving CapEx. And as we said before, we know that there's a bias here of making real estate investment decisions with a high as a long-term investor, and with that the ROI over a longer period of time has always been very enticing to us. And I think your second question on the spike that we saw in performance that we're very pleased with in the fourth quarter, and then what does that translate to in the first quarter, a couple of things. One is, as we talked about during the call that the comps in the first quarter of 2024 are probably among the most challenging on the billings line and the product revenue line that we think we're going to see. And then I think also the reentry one doing six eight-figure deals in the fourth quarter and being a record, obviously put a lot of tailwind into that fourth quarter number. We like eight-figure deals, but I don't know that we're really in the business of forecasting them each and every quarter as we go forward. Ken Xie : Also, we kind of own probably a high percentage of some infrastructure, some real estate, and some of our competitors. That actually gave us much lower cost, operation cost going forward, which also will help drive the future growth, especially on a service like a SASE. And that also gives us a better margin long-term. Tal Liani : And then free cash flow specifically because your stock trades on free cash flow, should we expect free cash flow to go down, or is it -- can you offset the increase in CapEx with something else? Keith Jensen : Well, obviously, there's a lot of levers that come into free cash flow. I think that where we look at in terms of where the street was for free cash flow in 2024 for the full year, I think that's in the ballpark at this early stage. We don't really guide to free cash flow, as you know. But I think the puts and takes, one is CapEx, which is not all that far away from what we saw in 2023. But then you have the operating profits, the buildings throughout, etcetera. You know all the components that go into it. Tal Liani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Gabriela Borges : Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm looking to better understand the SASE dynamics that you're seeing at the lower end of the market versus the higher end. So maybe any commentary on the S&B part of the SASE pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of willingness and readiness to convert, what you're seeing in terms of competition, and what you're seeing in terms of average deal sizes in terms of uplift when you get a SASE deal versus a regular firewall deal. Thank you. Ken Xie : S&B is pretty interesting. We do quite well in the SMB market, even for the traditional firewall, bigger than any other competitors. But also SMB has a pretty low percentage of a customer actually using any network security because of whether the management costs or some other people cost, all these kinds of things. So that's where SASE applied there, definitely helping some SMB customers. But also we see kind of the long-term combined both where to work from home, we're pretty strong like a couple years ago in the retail branch office solution there, also helping us kind of like doing well in SMB. And also the new product refresh, which leveraged SP5, we're only half the way, probably towards the second half of this year, we have more product come in using the new SP5. That's also keeping a hands-up position there. It's kind of like I said, it's a SASE more kind of consumption model. In a current environment, probably it would be more attractive compared to a CapEx model. So that's where we see both SMB enterprise, they do have some more interest to do this kind of OpEx model. Maybe John Whittle. John Whittle : I would just say that the success we had in enterprise, this is John Whittle, by the way, with the number of eight-figure deals and having over a half million customers out there, really bodes well both in enterprise and in the SMB market because we've got so many customers out there that are testing our product and so many customers that are providing feedback along the way to improve our products that it's a real testament to the products and gives both enterprises and the SMB comfort in buying our products going forward. And you can kind of put yourself into a customer's shoes and say, okay, some of the most discerning customers are spending eight figures on these products and services, and we have strength in SMB and upmarket. I think that bodes really well for kind of the smaller segments of the market and the larger segments of the market going forward. I think that's a real headline from this quarter in terms of the real success we had with some of the most discerning customers out there. Gabriela Borges : Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here and well done. Keith, maybe for you, I just want to talk about the shape of billings a little bit here in 2024. I think at the midpoint for this year, billings is about 2%, give or take at the midpoint. How should we sort of think about the exit rate on billings this year? I know that was something we talked about in prior quarters. I'm not sure if that's something that we could just revisit. And then maybe relatedly, it was great to get the segment detail, by the way, across the three segments. How are we sort of thinking about the rough growth ranges for those three segments as part of this guide? Keith Jensen : Yes, I think on the billings trend, if you will, I would go back to our prior conversations about, the backlog created a headwind, if you will, in the first half of the year. And I think you heard some of the tone of that, if you will, right before I gave the guidance this year. And that would suggest that, our expectations are that, billings growth rates should be improving as we move through on a quarterly basis, as we move through the year. I think we probably made it a little bit tougher on the sales team for the fourth quarter of 2024 by having such a strong fourth quarter of 2023. But I think they're going to do fairly well there. And then, I'm sorry, the second part of the question, Saket was? Saket Kalia : It was just on the three segments, right, secure networking, SASE, and SecOps. It was helpful to get sort of the growth ranges for this quarter. Not going to hold you to it, but how do you think about sort of the relative growth rates for those three segments this year? Keith Jensen : And maybe I'll answer that in the context of average contract term or duration, because I know there's a lot of concern or questions have been raised about, will that shorten the contract term? And you heard the data that we gave during the call. These two segments, we have a business that basically runs on average contract terms. We call it two years, two and a quarter, if you will. A SASE and SecOps business mix would probably be billing one year in advance when you look at the competitors and so forth. So that kind of gives you the range. It's going to take a while for SASE and SecOps to really impact that contract term or duration. And I think the read-through to that in terms of, we're excited about the opportunity with SASE and SecOps. If we have outsized growth there, we'll be very pleased with it. But I don't know that we're hanging our head on something completely out of the realm of reality, if you will, for 2024 for SASE or SecOps. Ken Xie : Yes, for the three segments, I don't have the latest market data, but from Q3, the firewall market is kind of flat here. Q4, we probably will read out company reporting. But we do see probably still under some pressure this year, especially the first half of this year. But I do believe the long-term converging story will hold quite well because the company also needs to manage the kind of application level, which is how to use network security to do that. So that's where long-term we do see the firewall market or the network security market will continue to grow, I feel, probably around 10% year-over-year in the next maybe three to five years. SASE and SecOps come from maybe smaller base, which also grow faster. And we also have a lot of existing customers. I want to adopt all this together with us. They probably already are firewall customers, D1 customers. They can easily adopt additional solutions, additional products. So that's where we see the other two sectors grow faster than the company average and probably continue to grow faster in the next few quarters. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. So I was just wondering if you could, and we've talked a lot about your other pillars. I was wondering if we could touch on SecOps and maybe what's driving that. Is that related to the recent SEC regulation? And then second, I was wondering if you look at your billing guidance for the year, where do you see the most risk as it relates to that guidance in terms of the three pillars and the performance you're expecting from those three pillars? Ken Xie : Yes, the SecOps is actually helping customers more like better security and more efficient and also lower the total management costs. That's where I need to have multiple solutions, multiple products integrated together, automated together. So that's what we see in the current environment of our company. And because small, they do see the SecOps already. The area they probably work on the investment there. And also we do see the merging of networking and security together, which also SecOps plays a quite important role to make sure the two operations can be operated together, which we are needing in this area. So that's where SecOps, we see pretty strong growth. SASE is more like consumption model. We also see kind of fit the current environment well. Even the cost could be a little bit higher than the appliance. But it gives the customer flexibility. And so that's where we see that. John, you want to answer? John Whittle : Yes, and I think for SecOps, what we're seeing is the threat landscape out there is driving a lot of the customer behavior as well. You see these ransomware attacks that are really debilitating to customers. And so prevention is important, but time to detection and time to remediation is critical. And it's real money. And these are really important issues for our customers. And also I would note, we've really been building this solution over many, many years. But we really just started to focus on it as a separate pillar three months ago. And then we had a record Q4. And so I think that degree of focus internally coupled with how we can actually help our customers, putting our customers first, really is driving a lot of the success there. And that new focus, we're pretty much sticking to the plan. The plan's working. We're sticking to the plan. And so we see a lot of opportunity there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much. I think I've got one for John Whittle and one for Keith. First, just for you, John, given your recent appointment as Fortinet's first ever COO, can you talk about your perspective stepping into the role and how you plan to help drive Fortinet's business forward? And Keith, for you, in your guidance comments, you said for the full year that you expect the selling environment to improve in the back half and into 2025. And I'm not saying I disagree with you, but I'm just curious why you say that. And if it's just relative to the comments that you also made on the firewall cycle dynamics or if it's something else, more broadly in the economy that you're expecting. Thanks. John Whittle : Thanks for the question. I'm really excited about the role. I've been working here for 17 years through a lot of growth, and my focus over those 17 years has really been learning from Ken and Michael and the team. And it's like an MBA on steroids. They're brilliant business people in addition to focusing on the innovation and the technology, which I think is a core differentiator for Fortinet. We are an innovation-first company. And I think our culture is really around what I call almost a straightforward baritocracy. And Ken and Michael drive this throughout the organization. It's very straightforward. It's work hard, work smart, innovate and put the customer first and deliver results. And so I really like the culture. Obviously, I've been here 17 years. Some people say I need to get more creative with my career, but I really \u2013 it really gets me excited to make a difference. And it's a positive difference. We're protecting our customers so they can get about their business. So I really like that. And in terms of how I can contribute, up until now I've focused on legal and corp dev. I'm taking over corporate real estate. I'm adding systems, manufacturing and logistics. And so I have a broad set of responsibilities. I also have always worked very closely with the sales teams. I will not be managing the sales teams, but I will continue to work closely. Teamwork is one of our top three culture items here. And we're not really boxed in here in a way. In a way, we really work together. And so we've got great sales leaders, and I look forward to working with them. We've got a huge opportunity to grow. We want to grow and capture that opportunity by putting the customer first. I want to support that. And to the extent I can help the team, I want to do that. To Fatima's question earlier, we're also very disciplined on the cost side. And as Keith said, we have this services model where we have a lot of visibility based on the deferred revenue on the top line. But we also are very disciplined at kind of managing and monitoring the costs on a real-time basis. And, sometimes you can control the costs, more quickly than other things. And so what I've noticed is, we're very good at kind of managing that on a real-time basis, and we'll continue to do that as well. Brad Zelnick : Welcome, John. John Whittle : Thank you. Ken Xie : Thank you, John. And John also helped us form the company culture in the very beginning, which is the teamwork and also openness and also innovation. So we'll continue to maintain this culture and keep growing the company together. Keith Jensen : And then quickly, Brad, on the other \u2013 I mean, yes, obviously, the view of the firewall cycles has some part of it. But I think probably more of the point is the digestion of products and projects. And if you look back at where the peak was of firewall purchasing and you kind of play that out, you should be coming to a logical end of deployment cycles. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : Hi. Many thanks. And Peter and Keith, thank you again for the disclosures on the segments within billings. It's very helpful. Two questions. One is on strategy and one is on guidance. Ken, on the strategy question, I wanted to ask you on your perspective on the Unified SASE, excluding SD-WAN and SecOps. There's two broad variables that I think about. One is go-to-market and one is product or R&D. You've clearly increased the go-to-market efforts surrounding unified SASE and SecOps. I'm wondering, do you feel the need to also incrementally focus on the product side or incremental R&D, if you will, to strengthen the portfolio for things such as improving your positioning within the Gardner Magic Quadrant or however you want to think about it. So is it more go-to-market that you think incremental efforts or it's both incremental, both the R&D side and as well as the go-to-market? And just in the interest of time, I'll ask my second question. Keith, on the guidance, given the performance in the quarter, and I'm really focused on the year, not the March quarter, it does seem very conservative. You very much outperformed your expectations associated with the December quarter. And you're guiding for kind of 2%. And even if you normalize for the backlog burn, you're sort of mid-single digits, maybe a little bit better than that. And so I guess I'm just trying to reconcile that it seems like very conservative guidance. And perhaps the way to ask the question is, how do you think about the product side as we get to the back half of the year? Do you think that industry demand returns to normal levels, or do you still think there's some pressure on the product side or anything else you want to draw comments on associated with what seems to be conservative buildings guide? Thank you very much. Ken Xie : Yes, a very good question about SASE. Definitely we want to do both, even more than that. So we definitely see the opportunity changing our go-to-market strategy because a few months ago, we were more dependent on the service provider carrier trying to do a SASE. I helped them do a SASE. Now it's more go-to-market, direct ourselves, and at the same time working with our service provider, but also more important, really, internal R&D, internal investment in the infrastructure. Like we mentioned, now we have over 150 pub worldwide, probably can match any other competitor, and same kind of function, the innovation, and also put all the SASE in a single OS, and then a lot of functions that are using ASIC will accelerate, and that also make our SASE solution much better, more advantaged compared to other competitors, and also more easy to deploy, more easy to manage. So we see that's a huge opportunity for SASE. It's not just SASE using the traditional cloud approach, but also on-premise SASE, the private SASE. So we see a lot of opportunity for SASE going forward, both on the technology, which we also work at, our innovation, developing technology, and at the same time, the go-to-market strategy, once we focus, we see huge success behind. Keith Jensen : And just on the guidance, Keith, appreciate the thought after kind of a tough middle of the year last year for us, or for me. I think keep in mind that we do probably have between $150 million and $200 million of headwind related to backlog, or year-over-year comparisons, if you want a backlog impact in the year. I think also in some of the commentary that we provided right before guidance, where we talked about the relative impact, specifically the product revenue, and what you should see from service revenue for the year. You can kind of get a sense of what we're thinking about for product revenue. I think I do see that some opportunities on the service revenue line with things that come from SecOps and SASE in the year, but I think all-in-all, I think where we're at right now, in terms of the full year guidance number, is an appropriate number for us. Keith Bachman : Okay, all right, many thanks. Congratulations, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, guys. A couple for me. First, on the comp side, as you move into 2024, can you share a little bit more color on the changes you're making or have made to the sales comp and what kind of incentives have you laid in place in a way that's different than 2023? And then on the competitive front, just given where your position on SecOps and SASE, I think you've talked about kind of more meat enterprise on the SecOps and more SMB is the largest category in SASE. Can you talk specifically on who do you see more as competition in those categories? Because you don't seem to kind of stretch the entire customer profile or regions, frankly. So we'd love to get a little bit more color into who do you see more versus less in those categories. Thank you. Ken Xie : Yes, we kind of keep improving the sales comp plan and also trying to line up what the company goal and what's the field sales and also how we can move kind of a tie together and success together so that there's some modification of the comp plan which move towards the company long-term both on the growth and the margin and also reflect more on some kind of a service based kind of model there behind. So that and also kind of keeping investing in the sales force and also kind of making the structure more efficient that's other area and also training the sales and make sure because there's a lot of new area whether the SASE and SecOps do need a lot of training that's also the big enhancement we are kind of going through right now. Keith Jensen : Yes, I'd probably add to that as well just a couple of things on the comp plan conversation. This is the time of year where comp plans go out and I think every company seems to make some changes. I think the real thing that jumps out at me this year is that I think after the 2023 results the quotas are probably a little bit lower on an individual basis than they have been in the past, and we probably put some things to work in the other direction on it. But to Ken's point, we really want to make sure that we're investing in building on the sales team and making the adjustments in the quota for 2024, I think is appropriate. On the SMB and SASE, probably -- the SASE and SecOps conversation. And I think it goes back to some of Gabriela's question before, at this stage, they're really shaping up in terms of having different customer mixes. The SMB portion of SASE was about 55% of the business. And we're not surprised to see us having very, very early success there. We're pleased with the development and the feedback we're getting from third parties about the success of the SASE product. But that, together with our SD-WAN customers is the logical place to see success. On the flip side, SecOps is almost the opposite, but large enterprises providing about 55% of the business. And I think the read through to that is all about consolidation. Where you're really going to have successes and it ties into the mix of repeat customers, i.e., firewall customers are now buying the SecOp product being very, very high. And that's what we would expect both of those business segments. Ken Xie : And maybe for all three sales and also sometimes even for a partner, if they sell all 3 solutions, secure networking, SASE and SecOps, they get more comp compared to only sell 1 or 2 solutions. So that's the additional incentive we offer to the field. Ittai Kidron : Maybe as a follow-up, Keith, how much of the opportunity here in SecOps and SASE is outside of our customer footprint. Is the vast majority of traction here just with your existing installed base? Or it also pulls you outside. Keith Jensen : Yes. Given as John pointed out, we have over 500,000 customers. So I'm okay with an installed base, right? And I don't think that's anything new for several years. We've talked about new logos representing large numbers, hundreds -- thousands of new logos, but they've never really been more than 10% of the business. So I don't think that this is really going to change with that. I expect that -- the firewall is such a compelling product because the price of performance advantage because of how more and more security have embedded into the operating system and the ASIC empowers that, that I'm not a salesperson if I was, I'm probably looking for those opportunities in the white space accounts. And then you want them like any other enterprise company to come back and sell more into that company. And that's really what you're seeing with the SecOps and SASE products that Ken and John have been talking about. Ittai Kidron : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Okay. Let me see if I can get everybody involved here. So Ken, I wanted to start with SASE and SecOps was obviously a key pivot point on the last call. As you focus on that more internally, could you summarize your competitive advantage technologically in those areas? And John, logistics from a sales perspective, I know it's been kind of kicked around a percent of quota retirement might be related to those areas. What did you land on for logistics? And lastly, for Keith, expectations for sales productivity as a result of that pivot towards SASE and SecOps. Just wondering your early observations on what you've seen because it looks like you do expect total margins down, but I think it's somewhat related to gross margin, not much efficiency drain. So it's just what you're seeing from a sales productivity perspective as you pivot to those areas. Thank you. Ken Xie : Yes. For SASE, we are the only company, we believe, has all the SASE function, SD-WAN, all the CASB, web service, all in a single operating system can be deployed on our premise [ph] using ASIC [indiscernible] or in a cloud form there. So that's a huge advantage, both for the customer, for the service provider. I think on the SecureOps side, we also most the product we internally develop whether from endpoint or from all these different like e-mail application, web, all this is because when we internally develop it integrate, automate much better than other competitor, more comp acquisition, which is a separate product that's more difficult to integrate, automate together. So that's the two huge advantage we have. We usually call the SecureOps more like a fabric approach. I've been doing that for 10 years, which is pretty successful, but now we have the same time which customer wants to hear is the SecureOp, which they see the huge advantage that drives a huge growth going forward and also the field training and also kind of help a lot. So that's the advantage we have, whether the SASE single OS approach can use as AC [ph] to accelerate and then the secure app is integrated automate together much better than other competitors gave us huge advantage. John Whittle : In terms of the quota retirement question, Keith may have additional comments on that, but there's really no change there. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think OTE and numbers targets are very much the same. I think on sales productivity in terms of what we saw in 2023, as we move through the year, obviously, productivity kind of came down. It seems to have leveled off now as we exit 2023. And I think that the modeling, if you will, is pretty much a similar expectation for 2024 in terms of where we exited 2023. On the -- there's a part of that I think in terms of what SASE and SecOps dramatically changed those numbers. I kind of go back to the earlier conversation about contract term share at some level if the mix shifts and becomes 50-50 or 60-40 to get the direction, then we probably have something to talk about, although I'd probably be talking a lot more about the fantastic growth in the SecOps and SASE than the fact that they had to pay salespeople to make that growth happen. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Liz. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending an investor conference hosted by Morgan Stanley during the first quarter. The fireside chat website link will be posted on the Events and Presentations section of the Fortinet Investor website starting soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to our first speaker today, Peter Salkowski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Brianna. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Peter Salkowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Fortinet. I am pleased to welcome everyone to our call to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Joining me on today's call are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, Chairman and CEO; Keith Jensen, our CFO; and John Whittle, our Chief Operating Officer. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Ken will bring our call today by providing a high-level perspective on our business. Keith will then review our financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2024 before providing guidance for the second quarter of 2024 and updating the full year. We'll then open the call for questions. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our SEC filings, in particular, the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for more information. All forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation and specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, all references to financial metrics, which we make on today's call, are non-GAAP, unless stated otherwise. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in our earnings press release and in the presentation that accompany today's remarks, both of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. The prepared remarks for today's call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of the Investor Relations website immediately following the call. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thank you, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. Q1, we've managed business with strong spending discipline and increased our operation margin 200 basis points to a first quarter record of 28.5%. We also generated record cash flow from operations of $830 million, and our adjusted free cash flow margin was 61%. We remain focused on investing in a fast-growing Unified SASE and secure operation market, which, combined, accounted for 1/3 of first quarter billings. We continue to gain security networking market share, leveraging our advanced and differentiated FortiOS and FortiASIC technologies with an increasing number of large customer adopting our industry-leading Secure Networking solutions. Last month, attendance in our annual Accelerate conference increased 25% year-over-year to nearly 5,000 participants. Our Unified SASE and new AI offering dominated the discussion with our partner and customers. For the first quarter, Unified SASE accounted for 24% of total billings. To introduce customer and prospect to our new Unified SASE solution, we plan to run attractive promotions this year in 2024. For several reasons, we believe no service secure company come close toward differentiated Unified SASE solutions. First, we have developed all Unified SASE functionality into one single operation system, the FortiOS. This includes a full networking and security set comprised of a ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB and our market-leading SD-WAN and firewall technologies, providing content, application, user, device and location awareness to reduce attacks. Second, our Unified SASE solution can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or both. Peer solutions send a traffic to copy the PoP, increasing security risk and latency and is less efficient. Last, Fortinet Unified SASE offer both traditional software endpoint agent and how are agents such as FortiWiFi access point and FortiSwitch for customers, with easier deployment and more broad use case such as Unified SASE for OT and IoT devices. We expect our differentiated Unified SASE offering to emerge as the SASE leader. Fortinet advanced platform approach has been earning third-party awards for many years. Last month, we entered Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Service Edge. As shown on the Slide 12 in the investor presentation. Fortinet is the only vendor recognized in the Gartner Magic Quadrant Report for Security Service Edge, SD-WAN, Single-Vendor SASE, Network Firewall and Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN infrastructure. All 5 security and network offering from Fortinet are uniquely built on one operating system, the FortiOS, and a leverage of FortiASIC to increase secure computing power for more functions and better performance while lowering the cost and energy consumption. Fortinet's Secure Ops solution, which are better integrated and automate than competitors, accounted for 9% of total billings. Initially launched as part of our FortiSIEM and FortiSOAR, our Gen AI technology, FortiAI, is being deployed across both networking and security products. And today, we announced the industry-first IoT security Generative AI assistant. Customers can ask FortiAI to help in 30-plus languages. Fortinet is also the market leader in OT security solutions, the fastest-growing space in network security, with billings of device connected online, and the most OT device has a limited compiling power, making new secure the most effective experience of security. Today, we announced the FortiGate 200G, a mid-range fire were powered by a new SD FortiASIC with secure computing rating of 3 expected performance real-time petites and industry average. We're enforcing our leading networking and Unified SASE advantage that provides customers with industry-leading security functions, performance and power efficiency. Before turning the call over to Keith, I wish to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continuous support and hard work. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the first quarter. As Ken mentioned, we continue to manage the business through the macro uncertainty and successfully drove operating margin to a first quarter record of 28.5%, exceeding the high end of the guidance range by 200 basis points. Free cash flow of $609 million represents a 45% free cash flow margin, benefiting from strong Q4 '23 billings and their subsequent collection in Q1 of '24. Billings of $1.41 billion and revenue of $1.35 billion were within their respective guidance ranges. Looking at billings in more detail. While Unified SASE and SecOps delivered strong billings growth, total billings declined 6% as expected. The billings performance was driven by the difficult year-earlier comparison, created by the backlog contribution to billings that occurred in last year's first quarter. Total bookings were down just slightly. Unified SASE and SecOps had outstanding growth across a variety of benchmarks in the first quarter. In addition, we saw significant progress from our investments in Unified SASE and SecOps. These include cross-selling into our large installed base. Existing customers delivered over 90% of SecOps and Unified SASE billings. On an even more targeted basis, existing SD-WAN customers delivered 81% of Unified SASE billings. Larger enterprises are proving to be our largest customer segment. with large and enterprise -- large and mid-enterprises representing 78% and 84% of SecOps and Unified SASE billings, respectively. Even with increasing scale, both pillars have strong pipeline growth, 30% for SecOps and over 45% for Unified SASE. More importantly, within SASE, the SSE pipeline growth is over 150%. Our investment in SASE is being recognized by third-party agencies. We recently recorded the Trifecta with Gartner's SASE Magic Quadrants, SSE, SD-WAN and single vendor SASE. And as Ken noted, with last month's addition to SSE, Fortinet now appears in 5 Network Security Gartner Magic Quadrants, again, all running on a single operating system. With the SASE Magic Quadrant Trifecta, customers have shown increased interest in learning more about our unique SASE platform that runs on the one operating system with one Unified agent, one management system and one data lake. To offer an example of customer interest at our Accelerate conference early last month, the SASE demo booth was our most active as customers surveyed SASE's new features and functions including end-to-end digital experience monitoring, remote browser isolation, advanced data loss prevention and third-party SD-WAN connectivity. As a second example, Nearly 25% of the accelerated attendees who joined our CMO for the SASE breakout session. The attendee number for this breakout session would have been even higher if it wasn't for the fire marshals regulations that forced us to turn away customers and partners who are eager to hear more about the SASE offering. And to offer one final example, the customer partner SASE Fast Track training program at Fortinet, which launched in January, is already this #2 most attended technical training session, trending only a single vendor SASE partner, SD-WAN. We're committed to driving more effective security solutions worldwide and welcome greater partnership with our industry peers. The new third-party SD-WAN connectivity technology is designed to support consolidation not only on Fortinet, but with Fortinet. In terms of scale, we continue to open new Google and Fortinet PoPs in sync with our customers' expanding footprint and driving the deployment scale demanded by large enterprises. And a quick update on that 7-figure 300,000 seat education deal that we mentioned last quarter, the full production environment was activated in March, and we are on track to have their 300,000-plus seats on board to start the new school year. To expand on Ken's earlier comment on today's AR-related announcement, Fortinet's Gen AI assistant follows our FortiAI launch last year, by supporting and guiding SOC and NOC teams as they configure and manage changes to their network and investigate and remediate threats. Its intuitive interface allows individuals to engage using 30 different natural languages, bridging the industry's skill shortage. I encourage everyone to visit fortinet.com to learn more about the Gen AI system. Rounding out our billings commentary, SMB was a top-performing customer segment. International Emerging was our best-performing geography. And our 3 largest industry verticals continue to be worldwide government, service providers and financial services. Service provider and worldwide government experienced the highest growth while retail and financial services were a bit more challenged. As noted in our prior call, the 6 8-figure deals in Q4 '23 pushed our average contract term in DSO to elevated levels. The average contract term in the first quarter was 27 months, down just under 1 month year-over-year and 3.5 months quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 12 days year-over-year and 23 days quarter-over-quarter to 66 days. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 7% to $1.35 billion, driven by service revenue growth. Service revenue of $944 million grew 24%, accounting for 70% of total revenue and a revenue mix shift to services of 10 points. Service revenue growth was led by over 30% growth from Unified SASE and SecOps. Product revenue decreased 18% as expected, to $409 million coming off a challenging 35% year earlier compare impacted by backlog fulfillment in the prior year. Software license revenue increased 20% and represented a mid- to high teens mix of product revenue. Total net product bookings were down just slightly. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SASE security options, increased 29% and represented an annual revenue run rate approaching $750 million. Total gross margin of 78.1% was up 180 basis points and exceeded the high end of our guidance range, benefiting from the mix shift to higher-margin service revenues. Service gross margins of 87.9% were up 200 basis points as service revenue outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from the mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard security subscriptions. Product gross margin of 55.7% as we -- were pressured as we saw challenges related to inventory levels and the transition to a more normalized demand environment. Operating margin of 28.5% was 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the strong gross margins and prudent cost management. Looking at the statement of cash flows summarized on Slide 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $609 million. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes real estate investments, was $821 million, representing a 61% adjusted free cash flow margin. Infrastructure investments totaled $222 million, including $212 million of real estate investments. Cash taxes in the quarter were $31 million. And while we did not repurchase shares in Q1, share buybacks have totaled $5.3 billion over the past 4-plus years and the remaining buyback authorization is $1 billion. Now I'd like to share a few significant wins in the first quarter. I'll start with the 1 8-figure deal in the quarter, a competitive displacement and new logo win. This large U.S. financial institution selected Fortinet as part of their data center update and consolidation projects. Key to this win included our experience in this highly regulated customer data-sensitive industry and our ability to lower the total cost of ownership and exceed their low latency performance requirements. Similar to other large financial institutions separating from their incumbent, this customer is expanding their Fortinet footprint by adding our SD branch solution and planning to consolidate additional technologies. Next, in the competitive 7-figure win, a hospitality company that serves over 5 million guests annually updated their various Fortinet solutions, including their FortiGate firewall footprint and FortiNAC solutions. Keys to expanding our relationship included our price-to-performance advantage on the firewalls and the next solutions proven ability to discover and lock down devices that attempt to join their network, together with the operational simplicity, and integration of a dozen different Fortinet solutions the customer uses. In another 7-figure deal, a hotel and restaurant chain purchased our SD branch solution for 800 locations as well as our data center FortiGates for centralized management and enhanced security. The solution from our network security pillar included firewalls, switches and access points as well as a variety of software products. The SE branch solutions bring improved efficiency and security over their branches and IoT devices. Key to this win and in other retail opportunities is enabling retailers to deploy, expand and deliver a growing array of in-store digital solutions to support their customers' experience and increase their top line performance. As these customer wins illustrate, our Security Fabric platform includes each of our security pillars, Unified South, AI-driven SecOps and secured networking, making it the most integrated, most open portfolio of products in the industry backed by 1 operating system, FortiOS; 1 Unified agent, FortiClient; 1 management console, FortiManager; 1 data lake, FortiAnalyzer; and open APIs and integration with over 500 competitor and other third-party products. This integration allows customers to consolidate security solutions, thereby reducing operational costs, while increasing security effectiveness. Moving to guidance. As a reminder, our first quarter and full year outlook, which are summarized on Slides 21 and 22, are subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the second quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.550 billion, which, at the midpoint, represents a decline of 1%. Revenue in the range of $1.375 billion to $1.435 billion, which, at the midpoint, represents growth of 9%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 77.5%, non-GAAP operating margin of 25.75% to 26.75%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39 to $0.41, which assumes a share count of between 775 million and 785 million. Capital expenditures of $30 million to $40 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $240 million to $270 million. Before updating the full year guidance, I'd like to elaborate on the backlog headwinds easing in the second half of 2024 and share what we believe we are starting to see as early signs that the firewall digestion cycle is nearing completion. First, the billings headwind from last year's backlog drawdown is over $150 million in 2024 and gradually diminishes throughout the year with no headwind in the fourth quarter. And second, we're looking for early signs of a more normalized firewall market, one metric we watch is the average days to register security service contracts, as shown on Slide 19. In 2022, we noted that the user registered has increased about 50%, which was consistent with customers' buying and stocking behaviors at the time. More recently, this metric decreased by about 25% from SP and is now consistent with late 2021 levels. It is on a pace to return to normal levels in the second half of 2024. A reasonable read-through of the data is that customers are completing the inventory digestion process and are on the path to a more normalized firewall-buying behavior. And with that, for the year, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion; revenue in the range of $5.745 billion to $5.845 billion, which, at the midpoint represents growth of 9%; service revenue in the range of $3.940 billion to $3.990 billion, which, at the midpoint represents growth of 17%; non-GAAP gross margin of 76.5% to 78%; non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% to 28%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.73 to $1.79, which assumes a share count of between 780 million and 790 million; capital expenditures of $350 million to $400 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%; and cash taxes of between $500 million and $550 million. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. And I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin the Q&A session. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Keith. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Hamza Fodderwala : Perhaps both for Ken and Keith, you spoke to a lot of green shoots in your prepared remarks. SMB service provider growth looks a little healthier. You're getting a recognition on SASE, and you spoke to competitive replacements. That said, the billings in Q1 was a bit closer to the lower end of your guidance versus the high end. So just curious what drove that? And what gives you confidence based on what you're seeing in the pipeline to maintain your guidance and continue to assume a reacceleration on the top line in the back half of the year? Keith Jensen : Yes, I'll talk about the full year. I think that if you look at where we ended up in the first quarter, inside the guidance range, maybe just a little bit of weakness that we saw in Europe, just enough to move us off the midpoint, but not really a big movement in terms of where we are in our final results compared to the midpoint. And if we look at where we end up with the total for the year, I don't think we're at all far off from the plan that we thought. Maybe there's some more [indiscernible]  there that you're kind of pointing out. But as we look at the pipeline, to your point, I think the mix that we see in our pipeline today, together with some of the hygiene improvements that we worked on for the last 6 to 9 months, I think we feel better about where we end up with the full year numbers, if you will. I think, at the same time, when you look at the full year numbers and some of the outperformance in the quarter or better performance, if you will, with service revenue and product revenue, you see us bringing that number up a little bit. But importantly, at the same time, you see us also bringing up the margin number on the bottom line by about 0.75 of a point. Ken Xie : Yes. I think the high interest rate, making the money kind of more expensive, have a lot of enterprise kind of probably more favored OpEx instead of a CapEx for some of the networking security project. So that's where -- that's also the reason we're starting shifting the focus more on the kind of the SASE or kind of SecureOps, which is really more helping company saving the cost at the same time, kind of -- some kind of OpEx model.   So that's probably -- at the same time, we do make some adjustment in certain product price back to like pre-pandemic level, before the [indiscernible]. That's happening in Q1, probably has a little bit of impact, but it's -- overall, I think the product competitive is still more and more strong. And we still see a lot of replacement of our competitive product, which tend to be more expensive. And especially the new FortiOS introduced last month with more function, including the function in Unified SASE, all these things drive a lot of our change from the customer, and they're all interested to these new OS and the new product we have launched. Operator : Our next question is from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Gabriela Borges : For either Ken or Keith, I'd love to get an update on your pricing strategy more broadly. More specifically, how do you think about the trade-off between discounting when you're cross-selling a broader bundle of portfolios such as SecOps or SSE services versus being able to capture some of the value from the cross-sell? How do you think about that trade-off? Ken Xie : I think our price strategy is pretty consistent in the last 20-plus years. We want to maintain a healthy gross margin and also a healthy margin for the partners. And when we see certain cost increase like doing the supply chain shortage, whether the component costs or some shipping costs increase, we kind of increase the price. But now some of the costs coming down, we also kind of returned some margin to the partner and also low on product price to match the pre-pandemic level. But I think all this supply chain change in missing is over and also we're probably more focused on the new product and which follow kind of a healthy margin guideline. And I don't think we have adjust any pricing for the existing product anymore. It's really more focused on when we introduce a new product, we just want to make sure it's a healthy margin for all the parties. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Brian Essex : Appreciate it. Maybe for Ken, in terms of the SASE traction that you saw in the quarter, how much was SD-WAN conversion? And maybe a little bit -- if you could give us a little more color on the split of the customers that you saw in that business, the spot of maybe large and mid, small enterprise, so we can get a sense of competitively how you might be lining up against some of the peers in that SASE market? Ken Xie : I think that's a great question. I think we have a slide for that. Keith Jensen : Try to ask that question. Yes. I think we also included in the prepared, and I'll tap the answer while somebody follows the actual slide number for you, Brian. But I think that existing customers were over 90% for both SASE and for SecOps, so they were expansion sales. And Ken's kindly pointing out to me my Slide #8 is in the deck that actually give you a little more context for it. One change you may notice there is that, for the first few quarters, when we talk about customer mix and expansion opportunity, we did it by customer counts, believing that we were going to have a lot of penetration with the SMB space. And that was where you get a larger number to start seeing some patterns. What we've now seen is that the large enterprises and the mid-enterprises are actually dominating both of those pillars of growth. And with that, we've just converted those pie charts to dollar values, which is more traditional where we expect it to get eventually. Brian Essex : Okay. Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up on that topic. I think you mentioned, if I'm not mistaken, Unified SASE 81% of -- I'm sorry, SD-WAN, 81% of Unified SASE billings. And I think you might have given that metric to back into SD-WAN last quarter, if you could maybe iterate what that was? Keith Jensen : Yes, Brian. What we're trying to say there is that I think we're -- there's a common belief internally and probably externally that we're going to have a lot of success with the SASE solution by cross-selling our existing SD-WAN customers. And so the SASE billings that we saw this quarter, I believe the number was 81% of those were existing SD-WAN customers. Ken Xie : Yes. And also, we build SD-WAN function into the FortiOS, which, whenever you have a FortiCare, we believe like close to 60%, 70% customer all have by the FortiCare, they have automatic SD-WAN function. And so that's where we do see other SD-WAN, current SD-WAN customer, which we were not fully tracking because the part of our [ list function free ] of charge. So we do believe a lot of them are [ interest ] come into SASE for SASE function there. Operator : Our next question is from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Fatima Boolani : Keith, I wanted to -- have you spent a little bit of more time talking about some of the geographic theater-level performances. So we've seen a pretty material deceleration in your Americas business. EMEA has been relatively resilient and APAC's actually shrunk this quarter. So I was hoping you could put a lens on each one of those geographies to talk about any nuances or idiosyncrasies from a demand and/or buying perspective from an end market standpoint or a customer attribution standpoint. And then just a follow-up with regards to if you can talk about the pipeline and pipeline growth you're seeing with secure SD-WAN proper, considering that is such an important conduit for future SASE upsells. Keith Jensen : Okay. where to begin? Kind of cherry picking through some data points. I think one -- first and foremost, the SMB continues to perform stronger than expectations, whether that's external to the company or from other sources, if you will, it's very resilient. And I think it's simply the breadth of the SMB space together with, as I've said in the past, the success of the channel program. I think Europe was just a tad that light in the quarter and a little bit on the enterprise side of their business and probably just enough, as I said before, to move us off of the midpoint of our guidance. I think what we spent a fair amount of time with more recently is looking at where the 8-figure deal is coming from. And if you're looking at the deceleration, and let's take the U.S. enterprise as an example of that, last quarter, we talked about 6, 8-figure deals in the business. The vast majority of those are in the U.S. enterprise. This quarter, we generally noted that we had one 8-figure deal. And so you can see that those 8-figure deals can whipsaw that growth rate for the U.S. enterprise around quite a bit really because if there are opportunities in these 8-figure deals that maybe some of the other geos don't have. We really don't have those opportunities in APAC and some of the other geographies that we see in the U.S. I think the other part of growth, I mean, I think we I think we have to understand where the firewall growth is right now in terms of the industry. And with that, it puts a lot of the pressure or opportunity for us to sell the SASE solutions and the SecOps solutions. And you're probably seeing a little more maturity in the ability to sell or the openness to buy SecOps and SASE solutions in the U.S. and in Europe, the larger economies, than you are in APAC. Ken Xie : Yes. Also, Japan probably kind of about is the biggest country for us in APAC and probably 1/3 of more APAC, which the currency like the U.S. currency pretty strong again. Japan currency is that may also have some impact of some slowdown there. On the other side, we do see most SD-WAN customers definitely more interest in the SASE and also in the current environment, more and more customer set in terms SD-WAN because SD-WAN definitely have been a cost saving. So on average, it's about 50% in cost savings compared to the traditional NPI or other networking function there. So we do see more and more customer first converting to SD-WAN customer and then using the same FortiGate adding additional SASE function there. Operator : Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Tal Liani : You gave some comments at the end of your prepared remarks about signs of recovery of the firewall market? And would you mind to repeat that? You went over quickly in -- the question is also with it, do you expect the non-FortiGate to recover? Is there a correlation between the two? Do you expect the non-FortiGate to recover? And -- or does it have its own cycle. On the first question, which is about the firewall recovery, do you see that the market share situation is changing, meaning the share gains you experienced in the 3 years of the boom cycle, do you have any reason to believe that it's going to slow down or you're going to maintain market share gain? How does it change when the market recovers, what drives the share dynamics to change or to stay stable? Keith Jensen : Do you want to take the market share and the mix, and then I'll go through the algebra on Slide 19. Ken Xie : Yes. I think we believe we continue gaining market share even right now the quarter -- last quarter in the cyclical secure networking, which both the firewall and also some other like  FortiWiFi FortiSASE space there. And I think because whether the strong performance advantage, we have all kind of more function can give a customer, like a better ROI return and better security and also more deployed case compared with the traditional firewall. So we feel we're keeping gaining market share. But overall, I have to say that whether the network secure firewall market or the networking market definitely has gone down like 10% to 20% year-over-year. But even in that market condition, we keep on gaining more share -- market share in this environment. Keith probably will answer the digestion question. Keith Jensen : But yes, for people that have access to it, Slide 19 in the deck. And for those -- a lot of you have followed the company for quite a while and you remember that we have some pressure on software revenue early in the pandemic, and we talked about things like the impact from Russia, but also that we were seeing a delay in customers registering the service contracts that attached to the hardware contracts. And if you look at that chart, you can see that, that delaying activity really started at the end of 2021, peaked at the end of the beginning of '23, kind of plateaued and now has moved down. And what we believe as you're seeing there is that when the supply chain hit, customers bought the equipment, put it on the shelves and did not need to register the contract as quickly and that's why you saw the increase in the days of register. Now as we move through the digestion cycle, you've seen that inventories come off their shelves and those days to register are starting to return to normal. We're not quite there, but we're actually quite close to it. And I would just offer that, I think, as I said, by the second half and the second half of this year on the current pace, we would return to where we were at pre-COVID on that metric. And again, we think that's a very good indicator of where customers are in the digestion cycle. Tal Liani : Got it. And what about the question on non-FortiGate. What are the cycles within non-FortiGate on the FortiGate side? Keith Jensen : Well, first of all, you're going to get me in trouble for using the term non-FortiGate. We talked about SASE and SecOps, but we're all showing our age here a little bit. Ken Xie : The notice probably around 10% of our product, that's probably -- all the networking side, definitely down a little bit, but there's some other like whether the FortiWeb, FortiMail some other we see for we see pretty strong growth. So it's a mix. But overall, I think pretty much similar like the FortiGate mix. But definitely, we see it. And on the other side, we do see some early signs of interest a customer using our FortiWiFi AP FortiSwitch as a hardware agent for the SASE. So that's also one of the promotions we're going to really offer some customer. If they got a FortiWiFi, they probably can run some free FortiSASE function for some time. So that we see could be driving additional non-FortiGate growth. But we -- actually, all the non-FortiGate product, we also have a technology called FortiLink. It's all like FortiGate, like FortiGate, whether that's kind of the aging firewall host or a host working together with FortiWiFi or FortiSwitch. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Robbie Owens : Keith, I want to build a little bit on your answer to Fatima's question earlier. And I believe you used the technical term of whipsawing when it comes to growth when you saw 6 large transactions, very large transactions in Q4 and 1 in Q1. And just I wanted to ask it relative to health and enterprise and what you're seeing here in the pipeline. Should we expect similar types of results in terms of those very large deals as we move throughout the year? And how do you think the pipeline is setting up in relative health of the enterprise? Keith Jensen : Yes, I feel good about it. And I think we're -- the parallel that I've drawn in the conversations before is that if you went back to 2015, '16, you saw the company moving away from -- or expanding beyond the SMB space and doing $1 billion deals. But it wasn't that there was enough $1 million deals that we couldn't get whipside by them then. Now we've got plenty -- well, I can always take more, plenty of million dollar deals, but the $10 million deals are whipsawing us around a little bit. You saw that with a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. And I think we were pretty open about that in the fourth quarter and setting expectations for the first. One thing we have spent some time doing is going back and looking at the number of 8-figure deals we have by quarter, for, say, the last 3 or 4 years. And you're looking at a model that maybe had one of the other quarter or 5 years ago to now where you're probably average something on the order of 2, perhaps 3 of opportunities over a full year per quarter. They're going to get condensed sometimes in certain quarters. With our business model in the history, you see that Q4 obviously outperforms as does Q2 typically perform strongly. And I suspect as we look forward, we'll see a little more concentration on those 8-figure deals certainly in Q4 and maybe some in Q2. Operator : Our next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Ken, maybe the first one is for you. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how your conversations are going with customers around their plans to refresh their firewall appliances. And maybe specifically, when would we sort of expect that firewall refresh to sort of begin? Does that make sense? Ken Xie : Yes. The 3 parts of the business. One, like Keith mentioned, is really the digestion whatever supply chain issue. I think that's pretty much over, maybe just a few more months, it will be all normal. And the second part is really the refresh, which is the current customer over the new product, which has a better performance, all the things there. I have to say, seeing the economy slowdown or high interest rate environment, some customer may stretch the current product a little bit longer. And -- but we do see more cases, we call it replacement, and also the new area like OT/IoT security. So we do see the requirement pick up quite well, which, when they face in like where they need a new function, like the new SD-WAN function or the SASE function, a lot of our big enterprise starting using our product to replace a more competitive product because they have to offer like multiple product to match one of our FortiGate or FortiOS solution there. And we also have a much better performance and power efficiency. We use [indiscernible] measure for every product. So that's replacement case, definitely picking up quite well. The refresh probably would still need some time to come. And on the other side, the new area like OTT security, we see other strong growth. So that's a new market because really all this OT devices not connected online or kind of canola has now protection and pretty much impossible to run endpoint software because of different operating system living computing power. So we see this new OTL space pick up quite well. That's the new market. So long-term wise, I still believe the network security market continued to grow. And -- but probably will be more mix in the current environment, probably a little bit more towards the OpEx model, which is kind of a -- and -- but for us, the differentiation is really, we have all the staff in the same FortiGate operating system FortiOS, which customers can run whether on-premise or in the cloud and the PoP. So we do see a lot of customers that then turn on the SASE function, maybe starting the SASE function first, then the additional strategy function, additional SASE service. So that's the way they are starting doing now. Saket Kalia : Got it. Got it. And maybe the follow-up is on that point, kind of if I can stay with you. Just on that topic of refresh and replacement, is there any sort of change in thinking for those customers about firewall versus SASE? And I mean, as part of the discussion, you mentioned pricing earlier, are you getting any sort of pushback on just appliance pricing since sort of the prior round of adjustments that you did sort of during the supply chain? Ken Xie : We have not seen any pricing pressure discount because we tend to be much better performance and more function because of ASIC technology and none of our competitor has. On the other side, [ billion ] customer considered a new function they needed for security or higher network speed environment, I think compare us to some competitor because competitors sometimes they just cannot keep in function like all the SD-WAN function in their existing firewall for us is very, very different. So we have all the SD-WAN function, all the new SASE function built in into the same FortiOS running on different kind of FortiGate device there. So that's also kind of helping customers to really keep adding additional functions sometimes without really replacing the existing hardware, so that's really helping the customer keeping kind of adding surveys and had secured with new function there. And also, that's also driving a lot of replacement of our competitor solution, especially in the big enterprise environment. So that's we see the strong -- the strongest growing area for us actually is enterprise customers, which they not enter some finance stretch because the high cost are the money. But we do see that the growing in our enterprise space or strong and a lot of replacement of competitive solution using the FortiGate which has a more function, better performance, low cost and also more efficient on the energy consumption there. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of analysts. Brad Zelnick : And because we just had 2 for Ken, I think I'm going to now go for 2 with Keith, if we could. Keith, first one, I think, pretty straightforward with $1 billion left in your buyback authorization and the strong cash generation of the business, I was surprised to see and not buy back any stock in the quarter. Can you just remind us of your approach to buybacks and if any change in thinking around use of cash and specifically M&A? Keith Jensen : Peter's point, get our COO for M&A answers. So we're all -- listen, leaning forward here wants to say. I don't think there's been any real change in our buyback philosophy. We -- the term we use is we're very opportunistic. We do put a program in place with one of the Wall Street firms each quarter and we renew it. I think the important part there is looking at the $5 billion that we bought back over the last 4 years, and it's not that we're doing some other companies would do x percent of free cash flow or something like that. It is really looking for market opportunities and when we see them. can typically steps in and have something set up in that regard. And now John Whittle has been -- going to get a chance to join. John Whittle : Thank you for the question. on M&A, we've always been very, very disciplined. We've done some very strategic tech and talent tuck-ins. And I think you'll see -- we're open-minded. We consider M&A as it makes sense, but that's definitely been our approach so far. And I think you'll see that approach continue, although we will be [indiscernible] about M&A as it makes sense. Brad Zelnick : And maybe just my follow-up. I'm sorry, please. Ken Xie : Probably is the most busy time in the last 10, 20 years now to look at all different companies. John Whittle : Yes. We see a lot of opportunities in the securities base for sure. And so yes, we build a pipeline just like sales build the pipeline, and we consider them as they come along and reach out on product as well. Brad Zelnick : Got it. That makes all the sense in the world, and you guys have done a great job of it over the years. Maybe just on the margin discipline that -- and the leverage that we're seeing in the quarter, Keith, can you maybe just give us an update on head count plans and where you are year-to-date? And as maybe relative to 3 months ago, how enthusiastic you are and where you are in sort of pushing or pulling back on the throttle to continue hiring and how we should think about OpEx? John Whittle : If I can, we're going to say something on hire. Ken Xie : It's okay. I think we continue to invest balance the gross margin. So the area like a lot of on the long-term product, we continue to invest, and we do the selective hiring. And also, we also take this opportunity to mixing the management ratio or structure will be better. So it's more invest in the field sales engineering and also the R&D area and the kind of more flat on certain management level and making the whole company more efficient. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the -- setting aside the fact that need more resources in finance, but I was hoping Ken was just going to announce that, but that's probably not. The -- I think the business model, Brad, you've seen it through the cycles where -- if you look back at 2017, for example, and if you look at the gross margin number, when you start to see the slowdown of the pause, the cycle and the hardware, you start to see the mix shift to the really rich services. .  And then as the market recovers, you see that relationship change a little bit. Clearly, we're in a situation right now with the firewall market that the mix shifted 10 points of services, and I think that was 87% gross margin. It's making margin targets very achievable, let's put it that way. And I would imagine, I think we raised it by 0.75 of a point at the midpoint for the full year. That's a pretty big move at this point, and I think we feel very comfortable with that as we look at the rest of 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research Company. Benjamin Bollin : Keith, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the receivables drawdown and the DSO performance. I believe you made a comment on your prepared remarks about large deal impact in collections, but it does look like DSOs are below what we've seen for the last few years. So I'm curious if there's a change in working capital management. Anything notable there? Keith Jensen : No, I don't think there's really a change. I think there's always a few puts and takes, if you will. I think the real driver was that last quarter, we had those 6 8-figure deals, and I believe all those closed in the last week or 2 of the quarter. So that put a lot of pressure on DSOs and only having one 8-figure deal this quarter, which I believe closed fairly early in the quarter, in mid-quarter, but not in the last week. So I think that's really all I would point to there. Benjamin Bollin : Okay. And the last one for me. You talked a little bit about duration. If you step back, a lot of your business is done through the partner community. Do you have any thoughts on how much of that business is being financed by the partners themselves to manage this kind of CapEx to OpEx appetite? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think when you say partners, I would say that all the large distributors that we're working with are offering financing programs, either in some cases, it might be through their own captive. But I think more often not, it's white labeling somebody else's product, if you will. I think that also some of the larger resellers are also offering financing. I think that where it makes a little more sense for ourselves as an OEM is on larger deals, whether we move to the extended payment program or working with the channel and provide them capital, if you will, for the financing. I think there's a lot of different ways to go there. But I don't think good credits, so to speak, are suffering because they can't find credit. I don't think that's the issue. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel. Adam Borg : Awesome. Maybe for Ken, last quarter, you talked about a great job with increasing traction with enterprise agreements. And I was hoping you could talk. Obviously, I know 1Q is typically a smaller EA quarter. Maybe talk a little bit more about the EA strategy overall and the go-to-market efforts to more systematically drive these enterprise agreements, especially in the back half of this year? Ken Xie : Yes, I think we do see when we have a more enterprise customer and they also want to be long-term customers and also with many different products like the consolidation strategy they have right now, we see more EA. And at the same time, with that one, we definitely see kind of a bigger deal and also kind of a more long-term customer can be with us right now. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think that -- and John took this over, so he gets to make that -- his habitual rap on EAs. But as Ken kind of alluded to it, it tends to make a lot of sense when -- you're -- most usually going to see it as part of your expansion inside of a larger enterprise. You're probably not going to see it frequently with the very first sale into a new logo, you could. And I think some things that are really we're starting to see resonate there are the new FortiPoints program that we make available and things with that nature, where customers have reached that point where they're very comfortable for in that for the technology and our customer support, et cetera, and they start thinking about long-term relationships. They know they're going to buy more. They may not know what. But the combination of EAs and FortiPoints, I think, has been well received by the customer group. Adam Borg : That's great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. In the slide deck, I didn't recall seeing the breakout of the FortiGate by small, medium and large. I know that indicator has been less meaningful more recently. I was just curious, is anything interesting there as you think about the FortiGate sales by size? Keith Jensen : No. I think the two that take it really -- you see us at this point in the firewall cycle, it's really for us, we want to increase the focus on SASE. I think we feel very good about it. you see us adding some more information there. And to your point that it wasn't anything that was really new or earth shattering on the FortiGates. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO. Keith Bachman : And Peter and Keith, I appreciate the slides. I did find 7 and 8 to be quite interesting. And I want to focus my first question on that. And if you look at the amount of billings from SASE, 24%. Is there -- just any clarification on -- of that 24%, how much is SD-WAN? And then if I look at the SecOps really interesting that enterprise is 40% of the SecOps. And is there just any patterns or anything that's kind of bubbling up as a frequent purchase within the SecOps portfolio you have that is serving to be pretty interesting to the enterprise? I just -- I thought that 40% number was quite interesting. And believe it or not, I'm going to count that as one question. And then, Keith, just anything you could think about or guide us on the FortiCare support line item as we think about the correlation to the product sales, and then I will cede the floor before Peter gets a chance to cut me off. Keith Jensen : I need to reverse what I covered FortiCare, FortiGuard. I think it's a great question is FortiCare, which is the traditional support offering, we talk about services being a lagging indicator. It's really what did you sell before and what rep you're recognizing now. And what's important is that FortiCare is going to be more closely linked to more recent product sales, right, because you have fewer products to attach it. So you'll probably see a little more pressure on FortiCare there. FortiGuard, which is the security subscriptions, which can be bundled, but they can also now be a variety of SecOps solutions and SASE solutions is getting a fair amount of tailwind from those other two pillars. So you will start to see, I think, and have seen a little more divergence in the growth rates as it goes through the cycle, if you will, between FortiCare and FortiGuard. In the FortiGuard actually has higher margins. And I think that we tried to call out in the prepared remarks that if you look at the SASE SecOps business, which I'll just broadly call SASE, not currently FortiCare and FortiGuard, and our software licenses, you start to see a company now that has a run rate of about $750 million in, say, non-hardware and nonattached service contracts, which is pretty impressive, I think. Ken Xie : And I think since we only launched our own FortiSASE six months ago, we see pretty strong growth but also SD-WAN has been there for a few years. So I have to say, probably most -- a majority if not the most, SASE still more comes from SD-WAN, which is in the chart there. Maybe the better way to say is really look at the pipeline, so that's on key script. He said -- it's a Unified SASE probably pipeline grow like 45%. And then the SSE pipeline growth over 150%. That's maybe a better indicator as a pretty strong for the SASE interest and also leverage our both SD-WAN and the firewall market-leading position there.   So we do see a lot of customer adding the SASE, adding the SD-WAN and convert some of them to the additional service, which will probably come about over 90% of our -- like the SASE business  right now. And is also very strong interest from the customer right now. And at the same time, some of the trial program like using the FortiWiFi AP as a hardware agent offers certain free SASE service. That's also what drives additional like differentiated -- Unified SASE approach compared to the other competitor in the market, which we also drive quite a lot of SASE business going forward. So that's also the reason we believe probably within a few quarters or a few years, we'll be the #1 leader in the SASE market. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Gallo of Jefferies. Joseph Gallo : A lot of cool stuff around AI at your conference. FortiAI, any early feedback? And how are we thinking about monetizing that? And any impact to gross margins? And when can that benefit top line? Ken Xie : Yes. Could agree, there's a lot of interest in AI -- we started our time more fully to different products, which are helping customers more efficiently manage their operation there. And that's also what drive the additional service, additional product out there. I'd say it's still more in the early ramp-up stage, and -- but the interest is we very high end, we do see some benefit already -- but how soon will be materializing. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think it's some more tactical responses to you. In general, we're charging for it separately. It's on the price list. It's additive to it, and you're going to really push my technical knowledge, maybe somebody here can eat me out. But I think there's an LLM the customer has to go out and buy on their own, in some cases, to enable it. And then I would offer a really shameless plug. I really tell you, you should go look at our website and see the demo that was done at Accelerate with FortiAI, it was fantastic. Joseph Gallo : Yes. We saw it live. Just a quick follow-up on really, really appreciate the time to register or days to register metrics, it's really interesting. Was there any seasonality in that metric historically before or after firewall cycle? Just trying to better understand if we should expect to find a floor at 2019 levels or if there's a potential another leg down? Ken Xie : I think probably if I look back to 20, 30 years when there's a big attack in the space, then they drive some kind of a new function, then there's some rush by something maybe impact some of them. Otherwise, it's pretty normal, I don't know, 7, 8 [ week ] whatever a customer to register. And then the last 2, 3 years, the supply chain really changing sometimes certain channel partners on the distributor may try to have a little bit more inventory. And some kind of customer because it takes some time to deploy, they also try to order some actual inventory. But that's pretty much all normal now. If you place the order, you pretty much can get it delivered right away. No longer has the lead time anymore. So that's where we see is the digestion pretty much go over, and it's pretty back to normal in the current environment now. Keith Jensen : Yes. And I think the charts actually goes all the way back to 2019. And you can see it by quarter there. Nothing jumps out of me in terms of seasonality by quarter that we really have that I would call out to it. So... Operator : This now concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Peter Salkowski for closing remarks. Peter Salkowski : Thank you, Brianna. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are located in our earnings press release and the presentation accompanying today's remarks, both of which are posted on our Investor Relations website. The prepared remarks for today's earnings call will be posted on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations with immediately following today's call. Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis, unless noted otherwise. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Okay. Thank you Aaron and thank you to everyone for joining our call. We are pleased with our strong execution in the second quarter as we successfully balanced growth and profitability. We achieved record operation margin which increased 820 basis points to 35% and managed to building revenue in the high end of the guidance range, reached our full year 2024 revenue and operation margin guidance and we continue to invest for growth. Gaining market share and secure networking and investing in fast-growing Unified SASE and Secure Operation market. Secure networking customers are increasingly recognized our FortiOS and FortiASIC technology offering 5 to 10x better performance than our competitors while improving security effectiveness and providing a low total cost of ownership. For over 20 years, we have been leading the shift to networking and security convergence and the industry projection now indicate secure networking will surpass to traditional network by 2026, 4 years earlier than previously anticipated. In the second quarter, Unified SASE accounted for 23% of total building, up 1 point. We expect our differentiated Unified SASE offering to become a leader in the SASE market. We believe we are the only company that has built all the SASE functions organically in a single operation system. We have a converged networking and security stack, including our market-leading SD-WAN, ZTNA, Secure Web Gateway, CASB, Firewall and many other innovations. Our SASE offering provides flexible enforcement delivering a better user experience while securing access to application on-premise and in the cloud. Furthermore, we continue to build our own SASE delivery infrastructure, including leverage of FortiGate technologies, providing us with a competitive long-term cost advantage. As announced earlier today, we acquired Next DLP, a next-generation cloud-native SaaS data protection platform, extending from endpoint to cloud. This will allow us to enter the stand-alone enterprise DLP market as well as immigrate market for the SASE solution. We also recently improved our position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for single-vendor SASE and are the only vendor included in all 5 of major network security Magic Quadrant single-vendor SASE, network firewall, SD-WAN, secure service edge and enterprise wide and wireless in infrastructure. Each of the solutions run on our single unified operating system for the OS with AI-powered FortiGuard secure service and unified management. AI-driven Secure Ops accounted for 10% of total building in the second quarter, up 1 point. Our comprehensive Secure Ops portfolio backed by over a decade of AI experience offers the broadest range of sensors and advanced analytics to continuous access activity to identify sign of cyber strides. For AI harness generative AI to table chart our platform and help secure the operation team make better informed decision and respond to threats faster by simplifying the most complex task. Fortinet is available in FortiAnalyzer for the SIM and for store and will soon be available in other Fortinet product. In addition, we are pleased to further expand our secured portfolio with acquisition of Lacework and we believe that together, our solution form one of the most comprehensive full-stack cloud security solution available from a single vendor. Lacework organically developed AI-driven cloud native application protection platform will be combined with the power of Fortinet security platform, ensuring broad protection across network, cloud and endpoint. This acquisition increases our total addressable market by $10 billion and add a team of talented engineers dedicated to cloud-native security while also expanding our sales force that can sell the entire Fortinet portfolio of solutions. Yesterday, we announced several enhancements to Fortinet security platform which are already stand as the most comprehensive OT security platform on the market, enhancements include new recited plans [ph], advanced secure networking and secure operation capability and expanded partnership with leading OT vendors, reflecting Fortinet's commitment to security for the growing cyber physical system market. As further evidence of our innovation and commitment to excellence in OT, we recently earned a prestigious Red Dot product design work for a FortiGate Rugged 70G with Dual 5G model. Fortinet was the only secured company who will see this recognition in the industry next-generation firewall. Before turning the call over to Keith, I wish to present our employees, customers partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith? Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken and thank you, Aaron and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the second quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter. We achieved record growth in operating margins at 81.5% and 35.1%, respectively, while delivering top line numbers at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue grew 11% as product revenue exceeded our expectations, driven by robust software revenue growth and sequential hardware growth that more closely aligned with historical norms. We also added 6,300 new logos as we continue to invest in our channel partners. As you'll hear in a moment, we believe we are on a pace for another rule of 40 year. At the same time, we accelerated our investments in the fast-growing Unified SASE and security operation markets with the acquisitions of Lacework and Next DLP. Lacework strengthens our position in the high-growth CGNAT market and expands our total addressable market by $10 billion, while Next DLP improves our position in the stand-alone enterprise data loss prevention market. Combined, Fortinet will gain over 900 customers and talented sales and engineering teams. And I'll just pause here to offer a very warm welcome to team members from both companies. Continuing with our Q2 highlights, we've taken the lead in partnering with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA through a secure by design pledge and are leading with our responsible transparency practices. We want to emphasize, we understand customer trust is paramount to our business. Our continued success across all customer segments in each of our 3 pillars, represents hundreds of thousands of end customers testing and buying for net security solutions. Simply stated, this is a significant scale advantage and a responsibility a few others have and also offers customers validation at a very robust level. We are committed to responsible updates and deployment processes supply chain controls, product security measures and transparency. To understand more about the proactive measures we take to safeguard our customers and our reputation, please visit our trust website at fortinet.com/trust. Looking at billings in more detail. Total billings were consistent year-over-year at $1.54 billion, overcoming the headwind from the drawdown in backlog in the comparable quarter. At the same time, total bookings increased year-over-year and more importantly, the sequential growth rate approached pre-COVID, pre-supply chain norms. Unified SASE and SecOps delivered strong growth along with software while product sales recovered more than expected. We continue to see significant progress from our investments in both pillars and saw strong pipeline growth of 45% for Unified SASE and 18% for SecOps. Both pillars are gaining significant momentum within our installed base is over 90% of Unified SASE and SecOps billings are coming from existing customers. Larger enterprises continue to be our largest customer segment. with large and mid-enterprises combining to represent 86% and 82% of Unified SASE and SecOp solutions, respectively. Within Unified SASE, 40 SASE buildings continue to grow at triple-digit rates as existing customers can seamlessly integrate our solution within minutes to secure their hybrid workforce. While 40 client customers are able to use a single agent to secure Internet, private and SaaS applications. We've also integrated 40 AP with 40 SASE for securing thin edges and unmanaged devices. Our Unified SASE solution continues to gain market recognition. For the second consecutive year, we've been recognized as a challenger in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for single vendor SASE with the third highest placement in the ability to execute access. And as mentioned earlier, we are further improving our FortiSASE solution by adding powerful data loss prevention capabilities from Next DLP. Rounding out the billings commentary, the SMB was again the top performing customer segment, while international emerging was again our best-performing geography. On an industry vertical basis, technology and transportation grew at double-digit rates, while service provider and manufacturing were more challenged. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 11% and to $1.434 billion, driven by service revenue growth and software licenses. Service revenue of $982 million grew 20%, accounting for 68.5% of total revenue. Service revenue growth was led by 36% growth in SecOps and 27% growth in Unified SASE. As noted on Slide 5, Unified SASE includes SASE and related technologies together with SD-WAN. Product revenue decreased 4% but better than expected to $452 million. Excluding the impact of backlog, product sales growth improved 14 points quarter-over-quarter and a similar amount year-over-year. Software license revenue growth continued to accelerate at 26% and represented a high teens percentage of product revenue, a nearly 5-point increase in the software mix year-over-year. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SaaS security solutions, increased 32%, accelerating from 23% a year ago and providing an annual revenue run rate of over $800 million. Total gross margin increased 360 basis points to a quarterly record of 81.5% and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 400 basis points, benefiting from higher product and services gross margin as well as a 5-point mix shift to higher-margin service revenues. Product gross margin of 66% increased 250 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to increased software mix and lower indirect costs. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, product gross margin increased from 56% to 66% as hardware demand increased and inventory levels and related inventory charges moved closer to historical norms. Service gross margin of 88.6%, increased 240 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from the mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard Security subscription services. Operating margin increased 820 basis points to a quarterly record of 35.1% and was 840 basis points above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the record gross margin as well as cost efficiencies within the business. Looking at the statement of cash flows summarized on Slides 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $319 million for the quarter and $927 million for the first half of 2024, or $1.1 billion after adjusting for real estate and infrastructure investments. Cash taxes in the quarter were $252 million. As a reminder, last year's second quarter benefited from the deferral of approximately $190 million in cash tax payments which were ultimately paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. Infrastructure investments totaled $23 million. Average contract term in the second quarter was 28 months, flat year-over-year and up 1 month quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 7 days year-over-year and increased 2 days quarter-over-quarter to 68 days. While we did not repurchase shares in Q2, share buybacks have totaled $5.3 billion over the last 4 plus years and the remaining buyback authorization is $1 billion. Now, I'd like to share a few significant wins from the second quarter. In a 7-figure deal, an international government agency purchased 12 solutions across all 3 pillars, including 8 SecOp solutions. This new customer selected Fortinet because of our operating system's ability to consolidate over 30 networking and security functions into a single unified platform, covering SecOps, SASE and Secure Networking. The customer was impressed with the integrated security, end-to-end visibility and automated response features of our FortiOS operating system. Next, in a 7-figure win, a large utility company, expanded our partnership by signing their first enterprise agreement with us to safeguard their OT environment. This deal displaces 5 legacy vendors and includes ruggedized equipment deployed to the customers' power plants, control centers and substations. Keys to this expansion win were our proven expertise in securing critical infrastructure and our price for performance advantage. And lastly, in a competitive displacement win, our retail store chain purchased our FortiSASE solution in a 7-figure deal. This customer chose Fortinet because of our integrated FortiOS platform, as they were able to seamlessly integrate FortiSASE with their existing Fortinet security solutions. Now I'd like to offer some comments on customer inventory digestion and the firewall refresh cycle. Last quarter, we pointed to a 25% improvement in the number of days of registered FortiGuard contracts from its peak and view this as an early but soft indicator of that \"inventory digestion\" at end users appear to be normalizing and the firewall market could start to show signs of recovery. To provide an update on this indicator and other signs of possible improvement in the firewall market, we can share that as shown on Slide 19, in the second quarter. The days of registered security service contracts improved another 12 days and has now returned to 2020 pre-supply chain, pre-COVID crisis levels. Inventory commitments and levels are normalizing at our contract manufacturers and in the channel. And as noted earlier, the sequential increase in hardware sales in the second quarter aligned more closely with historical norms. While these indicators are positive, we believe customers are currently managing a tough macro environment and a key election year in the U.S. and we believe this is having an impact on our customers' purchasing decisions. As a result, we believe a full refresh cycle is unlikely to occur in 2024 but more likely in 2025. Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our third quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 21 and 22, it's subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Aaron provided at the beginning of the call. Before reviewing the outlook, I'd like to offer a few modeling notes in light of our Lacework and Next DLP acquisitions, covering estimates included in our Q3 and full year guidance. For billings, the acquisitions increased Q3 by approximately 0.5 point and the full year by approximately 1/3 point. Total revenue increased Q3 and full year growth by 1 point and 1.5 points, respectively. For gross margin, they decreased Q3 and full year margins by less than 0.5 point for each period. For operating margin, they decreased Q3 and full year margins by 3 points and 1.5 points, respectively. Inclusive of these acquisition-related estimates, for the third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.530 billion to $1.600 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 5%, revenue in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.505 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5% to 31.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.58 which assumes a share count of between $767 million and $777 million. Capital expenditures of $40 million to $60 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. And cash taxes of $125 million to $145 million. And again, for the full year, inclusive of the numbers we gave a moment ago, we expect billings in the range of $6.400 billion to $6.600 billion; revenue in the range of $5.800 billion to $5.900 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 10%. Service revenue remained of $3.975 billion to $4.025 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 18%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79% to 80%, Non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.13 to $2.19 which assumes a share count of between 767 million and 777 million. Capital expenditures of $320 million to $360 million. Non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of between $525 million and $575 million. I look forward to updating you on our progress in coming quarters. Before we begin the Q&A session, it is with deep sadness that we recognize the passing of our friend, Peter Salkowski, our SVP of Finance and Investor Relations. Peter was an integral part of the Fortinet team for over 6 years and was renowned for is passion for mentoring and developing the next generation of leaders. We'll miss Peter and fondly remember his commitment to fostering talent and nurturing potential within our company. I know that Peter worked closely with many of you on this call and the outlining of condolences and heartfelt memories you've shared since his passing clearly shows the positive impact he had on so many people's lives. Peter took great pride in his contribution to Fortinet and rightly so. having contributed to increasing shareholder value from $8 billion to $46 billion during his tenure Fortinet. We'll miss Peter. Aaron, back to you. Aaron Ovadia : Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan. Brian Essex : Sorry for your loss. Keith, if I could maybe touch on the margins. I think it's incredible margin results for the quarter. Could you help me understand or maybe unpack outside of the obviously, the gross margin benefit that you saw in the quarter. Maybe help me understand where you saw better cost efficiencies, how sustainable are they particularly in light of the effort to incentivize the channel and the sales force to focus more on selling SecOps and SASE with maybe some incremental effort? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the gross margin is the largest driver of what you saw in the operating margin, particularly when you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis and in that, we talked about or made reference to a more normalized environment for us in terms of inventory levels, turns and what we're seeing with channel inventory but also commitments to our contract manufacturers. So I think that we've been working through that for probably the last 3 quarters, maybe 4 quarters. And with that, I would say, I think we've returned to a more normal state and so I would expect that to continue on. I think we're getting a little more contribution from sales and marketing than maybe I'd like at the moment and I would expect us to make a little bit more investments there as we go through the second half of the year. Keep in mind, we're getting a very large group of salespeople as Ken made reference to from both the Lacework and the Next DLP acquisitions. But I think we feel certainly comfortable with the guidance that we've given for both Q3 and for the full year on the margin line. Brian Essex : Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. How should we anticipate the impact of the operating margin to reflect on free cash flow as we look through the rest of the year? Should we look at historical spread between margin and cash flow margin and maybe estimate kind of ballpark the same kind of spread? Or are there going to be more puts and takes like timing of tax payments that are going to mess with that free cash flow margin as we fine-tune our models? Keith Jensen : Yes. I don't -- I mean, I think it's a good starting point is to look at the improvement in operating margin flowing through to free cash flow. Some of the changes that we monitor would be things like contract duration but you've seen now that industries and companies have been talking about contract duration for several quarters and you really haven't seen that come through to us yet. I should say, yes, habits going to come through to us. And so I'm not I think we have opportunity to leverage our balance sheet more with our customers and prospects that we have. But I don't see over the next 90 days or 180 days, a dramatic shift in that area. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Hamza Fodderwala : I'll echo my condolences for Peter and his family, we'll definitely miss them. Keith, I wanted to follow up on the margin question because obviously, it was a very strong beat, I think a lot more than any of us were expecting historically, Fortinet has kind of managed the business towards the 25%-plus type operating margin run rate. I'm curious, is this the new base that we should sort of think Fortinet goes off of longer term? Or is it sort of a onetime margin outperformance given what you saw on the gross margin side coming out of the inventory digestion headwinds? Keith Jensen : Yes. Again, I think the inventory part of that is I think we've worked our way back to a more normalized state. So I think that is our business model going forward for it that way. There can always be something that changes but I don't see us anticipating something in the gross margin line and that is by far and away the biggest opportunity there. I think it also says that we clearly have the opportunity to more -- invest more in go-to-market than we did in the first half of this year. And I think we've factored in some of that investment ideas or those ideas in our forecast and our guidance. In terms of whether or not I make Ken Cry, when I increase the margin the way I did, that's a different topic and I'll let him respond to that. Ken Xie : Also, we'll benefit from the service revenue which has a much higher margin compared to the product revenue. So once the product starts growing, because product has a lower gross margin, that probably will impact the margin but the product is also the leading indicator of future service. So that's where we kind of also were happy to see the product also starting growing now which I think going forward with the product has a higher percentage, that probably also will impact the margin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Fatima Boolani : I wanted to share my condolences for Peter, he was just a fantastic person and he will absolutely be missed. Keith, I wanted to zero-in on your comments regarding software license growth. You talked about that accelerating 26% year-on-year, I believe and now it constitutes a high-teens percentage of your product revenue, I wanted to understand what are the drivers behind that massive mix shift and how we should think about the trajectory of this mix shift in the context of your guidance for the remainder of the year and bringing into consideration some of the hardware digestion, potential prolonging comments that you shared as well, if you can help us square that away? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the software license, if you kind of step back and look at what the business model is not to make it only simplistic, we want to -- it's so compelling to start with the firewall and it's very compelling to start with the ASIC. So a physical part of it, we don't always do that but we almost always start with a firewall, whether it's physical or virtual. Really, what you want to do is get the operating system in the hands of the customer. And what form factor that takes is we're fairly agnostic about that. So once that happens, then you start to see the knock-on effect of either selling more firewall use cases and other form factors into organizations or you're seeing that full portfolio, the SecOps product line take hold as continuous to expand throughout organization. So I would expect that we're going to continue to see tailwinds and growth, no doubt about it from the software part of the business. Will there be a mix shift that slows a little bit when firewall and FortiGate starts to return? Sure, absolutely. But this has been a trend that we talked about a little bit, I think, last quarter and probably some earlier quarters about the software mix and the mix shift that we've been seeing. So I would expect that, that's going to continue on given the success we're seeing in the other 2 pillars. Ken Xie : In the FortiSASE and FortiOS, we see customers setting turn around more and more function which also enable more service for us. At the same time, the FortiSASE Secure Ops has also fully pretty much our service base and plus a lot of secure a high percentage in software compared to the hardware on the secure networking part. So that's both helping drive the additional software and licensing growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Gabriela Borges : Either for Ken or for Keith. On the firewall refresh cycle, I can appreciate your comments on not expecting to see a recovery in 2024. Share us a little bit more detail on why you think we'll see it in 2025. And -- to what extent are customers giving you an indication that they will be refreshing in 2025, perhaps as we get through the election and some of the macro or perhaps because of their updated depreciation plans? Any color on why you think the timing will be 2025 would be helpful. Ken Xie : I think it's probably more Keith. I think the rest of the year probably still pretty tough to make an environment where the election or some interest rate is still pretty high. The money cost is pretty high that's where some companies may not really want to spend some long-term investment which is drive the product revenue and building infrastructure, so that's what we view. Also, if you look at it historically, every 4 years -- 4 to 5 years, the network here or another network in our security they need to be refreshed for faster, more function layer. So that's where we feel when we're starting this supply chain issue, they artificially put up the since lag started in 2001 [ph], maybe next year will be pretty much full year cycle now. So some company may start looking to refresh the product they purchased 4, 5 years ago, especially in certain vertical like retail, some other we see pretty strong growth in early days of a supply chain issue and we feel probably in the next 1 to 2 years, they may starting to return to see some investment on the infrastructure. On the other side, we see the big trend we always believe, always a hybrid mode, even there's -- like we have a very advanced SASE infrastructure side but also to secure OT/IoT area, to secure a lot of infrastructure, work for home and we do need an appliance in the field. And also even for SASE, we do offer both cloud-based SASE and also on premise-based private SASE. So that also needs some hardware to support in local for the customer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Tal Liani : The fact that -- can you go back to the fact that billings, you made 2 acquisitions this quarter, you didn't change the billing guidance for the year but you did beat the numbers for this quarter by $20 million, so in effect, you reduced the billing for the next 2 quarters. What are the drivers in billings? I know we spoke about it in the past but what are the drivers for billings and what's the outlook for billings going forward? Second question is your -- you grew revenues by 11%. But when you look at OpEx, they're flat. And you don't do buybacks now what's the outlook for buybacks? And what's the outlook for OpEx? Will it start growing now that you started executing on revenue growth. Keith Jensen : Tal, I think I kind of missed -- very, very faint on your questions there. Maybe if you can give us maybe a little later recap of the 2 questions you had. Ken Xie : I think that get some part about the 2 acquisitions impact on billing. I believe the post-acquisition, I think, Lacework maybe this year will contribute or maybe... Keith Jensen : Yes. I think that -- I mean if you kind of look at the recap of the year, there's not a lot of variability in it, if you will. We are a little bit light in the first quarter, we came back and recovered the first quarter shortage in the second quarter. Now you see us looking at the third quarter and maybe taking that just a little bit off of some of the Street numbers and looking to see a little bit of that back in the fourth quarter. But we're kind of taking the third quarter correction to the Street numbers and putting it into the full year number. But yes, offsetting a very, very similar amount in terms of what we expect to get from the acquisitions and that leaves the full year range very much intact. And I understand that tick up is quick, I understand part of that is I'm taking -- I'm getting inorganic benefit in that number of the 0.5 point that we talked about at the -- and really taking down the organic part of the business. But again, I think we're talking about small numbers here. Tal Liani : Got it. My second question can hear me okay now. But my second question was about OpEx that was flat and no buybacks. What's the outlook on those items? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the OpEx is probably a little lighter on the sales and marketing line than maybe we would like to see, particularly as we start looking at more opportunities as we get into the second half of the year and into 2025. So hopefully, we'll find some opportunities there to make investments. Obviously, you're going to get a fairly significant movement there from the 2 acquisitions that we just did and we gave the number about what the OpEx impact is going to be, that will largely be in sales and marketing. Buyback, I think that we still remain being opportunistic and that opportunistic number changes every 90 days as we reset our plans. Ken Xie : Yes. And also, in the market, whether the private company, public company, we see the multiple probably more friendly for [indiscernible] compared to the last 2, 3 years. So we should go back to more reasonable so that we see some opportunity there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Rob Owens : Curious relative to the macro and obviously a lot of cross currents out there, maybe what you're seeing via your different customer sizes and different theaters? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think because we are so diversified, as you kind of alluded to, 70% of the business is international and a little bit less than 30% in the U.S. And yes, there's been a lot of elections around the world this year but it's certainly the U.S. election, maybe weighing on people and every kind of taking a position of waiting to see. As you move -- pull back from that, the international emerging part of the business has been strong, very strong for several quarters and continues on to be. A lot of those are oil-producing countries and similar. So I think they've done well in this economic cycle. There are a little more risk there perhaps with geopolitical events in some of those countries. But to this point, it really hasn't had an impact there. We are much more likely to be the number 1 market share when you move outside the U.S. and parts of Europe and the Middle East and Latin America and parts of APAC. And I think having an incumbency advantage, if you will, helps you in those more challenging times because you're there, you're on site and you have that opportunity to cross-sell and upsell your installed base. Ken Xie : In the U.S., last next growing area which also needs more direct marketing, direct sales. That's also need more investment. So that's where we do plan to invest more into sales and marketing to keep gaining market share in the U.S. Rob Owens : And Keith, if you contemplate these acquisitions and a little bit of mix shift to software and I realize hardware is weak right now with the potential recovery next year. But how are you thinking about billings duration? You shave some off the back half and I think some of that's probably the mix shift towards software as we kind of look overall at the model and the increase in revenue but as we contemplate 2025, how should we think about billings duration and potential compression with more cloud-based or software deals that are likely shorter in nature? Keith Jensen : Well, I look forward to seeing you in November at the Analyst Day and we'll talk more about 2025 and midterm numbers. But in the interim, I would probably say that if it's a white space account in some of these places like Lacework would be, for example, I think it's going to be much more prone to having a shorter duration contract. If it's part of that 90% of be selling SecOps or SASE solutions to my installed base. What I'm seeing to this point is my installed base continues to purchase in terms of contract duration, the way they have historically. So they haven't -- if I sell something from the SecOp portfolio into one of my firewall customers, they tend to sign up for a longer duration contract than you may see from a point solution vendor. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal of TD Cowen. Shaul Eyal : Keith or Ken, so listening to Keith's commentary about the potential refresh cycle not taking place in the second half of this year but most likely during 2025. And again, not trying to front run the November Analyst Day but should we be thinking about 2025 accelerating over 2024? And again, I know you don't have the current visibility to guide to '25 but just conceptually, is it fair to assume another year of double-digit growth? Ken Xie : We do believe next year, there's -- I think first, overall, we see the long-term convergence -- networking convergence to network security, we're still keeping going. That's why we do give the CAGR in secure networking area is about 15% year-over-year growth. If you look in the investor presentation slide for about which page. But on the other side, we also see a lot of new opportunity, whether in the OT area in the Unified SASE and also upsell, cross-sell which are all helping driving, I would say, probably like a 90% customer initially moved by a FortiGate getting the firewall and network security market first which we have a huge advantage over competitors. But after that one, they're keeping expanding beyond the network security, go to the other area. So that's what's happening for the Unified SASE for the Secure Op. And now the product, especially on the FortiGate firewall side we're starting to see kind of go back to normal or starting growing with the market now. So, we do feel probably next year will be whether the refresh cycle which after -- that's where the existing customer, if they have the product for 4, 5 years, that's probably the average turn starting to refresh. And so we do see probably next year, we're starting that process. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Keith, I think you called out the service provider segment is more challenged this quarter after being a strong performer last quarter. And I know it's lumpy and remains a top vertical as it always has been for Fortinet. But can you share an update on what's happening in that segment? And in particular, how your value prop and unified -- and focus on Unified SASE and SecOps applies in this important vertical? Ken Xie : Yes. I don't feel the service provider telecom slowdown, it's really kind of lumpy and on the other side, we're also starting to see the telecom service provider more interest in offer their own SASE using our product solution or kind of helping customers do the private SASE, localized SASE which also will helping drive our long-term growth. But I do believe long-term wise, the service provider will be if not the biggest, probably one of the biggest part of the whole cybersecurity business because they have the infrastructure, they have the customer relation, so we still want to keep a focus on the service provider area. But for them, it's really the sales cycle resting is long and the deal pretty big, like 8-figure deal. That's where the lumpiness probably impacted the quarterly. But if you look at more long-term multi-quarter annually, I don't believe it's still keeping growing. Keith Jensen : Yes, Ken is spot on, right? It's a lumpy industry. Financial services can be to at times as well. But I think more importantly, I think the conversations around their own independent SASE solution that they can bring to market is something that's getting a lot more conversation from the service providers. I think we saw it first internationally and we're starting to see a little bit more of it here domestically. But that's going to -- that's a pretty exciting opportunity if it continues to move forward. Brad Zelnick : Just a quick follow-up on the very impressive operating leverage that you've shown us particularly on the sales and marketing line, where I know, Keith, you said that it's more than you'd like to see at this point. But just structurally, like to see it down, albeit very slightly sequentially on a dollar basis, especially as you outperformed on the top line and billings this quarter. I'm just trying to understand like where it comes from? And is there anything structurally that change that we should be thinking about, whether it's commission deferral rates, channel rebates or anything else other than headcount? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think there's a few things going on there. I think probably 9 months ago, we looked at the cost structure pretty closely. And across a number of areas. And the first place that people kind of look at and when you're in that vote is marketing programs and they get hit pretty hard early on. And I think you're trying to see that roll through you do make changes to your compensation programs, whether it's for direct salespeople or for channel people or what have you. And I think maybe as we're coming out of that environment now, it's important for us to kind of revisit some of those decisions and making sure I kind of talk about the investment opportunities that we have in the sales and marketing line. And I think I would include the channel net as well. It is why I would say that to your point or you're repeating me, probably a little bit lower than we would have liked it to have been in the second quarter. And I think we'll continue to make go-to-market investments here in the second half of the year. Ken Xie : Yes, I agree with Keith. We're starting tracking more carefully for the ROI for each investment in marketing sales and also try to improve the efficiency with the marketing sales. On the other side, we are a little bit behind on hiring in the sales and marketing side which we intend to accelerate. So that's actually what will drive the future growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam Tindle : I just wanted to continue the margin discussion. Obviously, you had great product gross margin performance this quarter on top of those tight cost controls. And the question really is around pricing dynamics in the core firewall business from here. The supply chain sounds like it's clearly normalized. You've had multiple years of price increases during this period of time. What are your expectations of the pricing dynamic in core firewall from here? What would it take to maybe even consider reducing price back to historical at some point? And any comments that you want to make on the competitive environment in light of this? Ken Xie : I think we have not increased the price in the last few quarters. I think that because we still believe we have a huge advantage with FortiASIC, FortiOS technology has a more function better performance, lower total cost of ownership and also energy cost. So we feel we're keeping that advantage over our competitors. On the other side, we don't see any pressure to also decrease price all kind of discount more. So that's where we feel we're keeping pretty stable for the price. And at the same time, that the customers see the benefit of our product solution and with better performance, more function which also will drive the future service. I think the bigger environment also, we don't feel changed much. Definitely, we see that the inventory all go back to normal weather on kind of inventory and also the channel inventory. That's also more helping driving the healthy behavior in the business also in the supply chain area. Maybe Keith has something to add. Keith Jensen : Just to repeat what Ken said, maybe a little more granularity. I think the price increases that you referred to, we're really probably a late '21, 2022 impact. And I don't think we're really raising prices at '23. We did take some prices down at the end of '23 and in the very beginning of 2024. But that's really been the only pricing actions we've taken in the last 6 months. And then to Ken's point, I think we're at a moment where we think it's probably -- the value for the solution is very, very strong. I think the energy costs that Ken mentioned is starting to get -- it's gotten a lot of traction internationally in Europe but you're starting to see more conversation around that in the U.S. and that could be people concerned about energy consumption and issues with AI and EV and government actions on manufacturing. So I do think the energy cost advantage is coming into play more. And then last one on that discounting was, I think, very much in line. I think we actually improved discounting meaning higher prices by about 1 point quarter-over-quarter and kind of a similar number one way or the other for the full year. So we obviously have room given the margins to use discounting and pricing as a lever. But I think there's other things that we'd like to push on first. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Adam Borg : Also condolences on Peter's passing. He's certainly missed by all of us. We'd love to talk about the Next DLP acquisition. Maybe talk a little bit more about what's attracting you to the stand-alone enterprise data protection market overall and Next DLP in particular? John Whittle : This is John Whittle. There's a lot of positivity around that. We obviously just announced it today, we closed it yesterday. We did a lot of diligence on the company, The tech is great. And not only will we plan to offer it stand-alone but also integrated with our FortiSASE solution. And so I think it's another step in steadily bolstering our FortiSASE solution, We feel very, very confident in our strategy there. For the most part, as you know, I mean, we've done some tech and talent tuck-ins. Most of our technology is organic I think to some of the earlier questions, you think about the firewall market coming back next year. And we really just started kind of organizing our solutions into these 3 pillars less than a year ago and the amount of progress we've made and the execution we've made in kind of developing very, very competitive solutions in SASE and SecOps in addition to secure networking is pretty impressive. And I think this is an important step along the way to continue to develop the best SASE solution out there to protect our customers. Adam Borg : That's great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up there, John. Maybe just could you comment on current level of sales force productivity for SASE and SecOps and the opportunities for improvement from here? John Whittle : Sorry, the sales execution with SASE and SecOps. Adam Borg : Just general sales force productivity as you've gone through many months at this point of training and just ramping of the ability to sell that across your company globally. John Whittle : Yes. No, it's a really good question. I think what we're seeing is it does take time. We are very focused on that broad sales enablement I always say, I mean, the opportunity just abounds from our solution set and we're always with a customer-first focus. So in terms of protecting and serving our customers the opportunity to bounce I think our sales force -- the good news is they have a ton of opportunity. I always say they're going to suffer more from indigestion than starvation. But we've got really a big focus in the company to really train up that sales force, enable that sales force, make sure we have the incentives in the right place and make sure we have the support. So when they do qualify different opportunities in different solution sets, the support to support them in that sale. So I think, like Keith had alluded to, we often land with the firewall and then expand and get that support to our sales force with SASE and SecOps solutions and we're seeing a lot of success there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Saket Kalia : Tip my cap to Peter as well. We're going to miss him. Ken, maybe just to start with you. I wanted to get into just the firewall refresh for next year a little bit. I mean you've seen so many refresh cycles over the years. How would you sort of compare this upcoming cycle versus others in the past? And maybe touch on how SASE and sort of -- maybe what sounds like a higher mix of virtual might sort of play into that? Ken Xie : Yes, agree. There's the infrastructure probably different than the last refresh cycle. You see more hybrid working environment, whether working remotely and also more supporting broad connection, including connect all this OT/IoT device level. For the SASE, we always believe also should be a hybrid SASE environment, not just cloud only. You do need to have a private SASE, some other local SASE offer by service provider. And also some time, the SASE also need secure some device which cannot install a software agent like using a FortiAP, FortiSwitch to secure this agent is device. So that's where we feel this also will always kind of the unified SASE will be the long-term future. We believe we also combine both the hardware and the software and infrastructure and appliance together. So that's where the refresh. On the other side, network security is always probably the biggest market -- I mean it has been the biggest market in cybersecurity for probably 30 years now, 20, 30 years and keep expanding because more people devices get connect and more application to access or even as cloud, you do need to secure on the network side. So that's what we see when you try to access the network side and also the long-term convergence of network in network security, that's also what drives the refresh. That's also you can see the Gartner research we pointed out, the convergence of network in the network security also starting or accelerating. So originally, I think last year, they say by 2030, the secure networking will be larger than traditional networking. Now they say, 2026, 4 years ahead, the secure networking will be larger than the traditional networking. So that's where we really invest long term on this trend. And with all this FortiOS, FortiASIC and making the best both appliance and infrastructure, the ASIC technology and at the same time, also try to investment more in the sales and marketing area to really catch the trend and also keep gaining market share. So that's the strategy to be ahead. Saket Kalia : That makes a lot of sense. Keith, if I could fit in one quick follow-up. Just on the software mix in product, I think you said, call it, roughly $800 million run rate. Can we just touch on, even anecdotally, roughly how much of that is sort of virtual firewall versus SecOps? And I realize they're coming in at software gross margins. But can you put a finer point on that and sort of what that aggregate business might be coming in at from a gross margin perspective as we think about that gross margin shift long term? Keith Jensen : Well, I think whether it's a virtual firewall or any other software product or the software licenses are all coming in at very, very attractive margins. I think that when you look at some of the SaaS solutions that are sitting in the services line for SecOps and so forth, you get a very wide range of margins there but it's only because of the relative size or maturity of the solution. Obviously, something that's very new and absorbing a lot of the hosting cost is a little harder. But those aren't as big numbers. As you see those SecOps solutions get greater and greater traction and more critical mass, the margins start to normalize. I think kind of what's really been exciting is the ability to absorb those data center POP, colo, everybody's got their hand in the products and on these things, cloud provider fees and developing the SaaS solutions and still bring up the services gross margin. And by the same token, being able to absorb the charge for Lacework on the operating margin line because we've managed the business in terms of cost of goods sold for the product side, I think we're really, really pleased with how those 2 things will work hand in hand. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo from Jefferies. Joseph Gallo : I also want to echo my condolence to the team and Peter. Sadly, big shoes to fill. I just wanted to double click on what drove the better performance in product in 2Q? Was there some large deals or region, segment or vertical that stood out, especially since you don't expect the refresh benefit until calendar '25? Keith Jensen : No, great question. I mean we've talked about 8-figure deals and our size 8-figure deals can kind of still will around, as you saw in the fourth quarter last year, we did 6 of them. We had one 8-figure deal, Q1. We had 2 in Q2. So I would wouldn't attribute to that. I think what we saw the last month of the quarter and particularly as we got into the last week of the quarter, what you see in a strong market is a lot of deals started to fall in place and we're getting across the finish line. I think we saw a lot more positiveness if you will, at the end of Q2 than maybe we saw say at the end of Q3 or something like that last year. Joseph Gallo : Okay. And then just on a follow-up to that. And I think it was a follow-up to Fatima's question. Given that mix shift, you now expect in the second half, given the delayed refresh, what is your confidence or visibility into the billings re-acceleration in the second half? Do you, in theory, have more visibility now, given that it's less hardware based? Or how are you thinking about that? Keith Jensen : Yes. I don't think that the form factor really impacts the visibility in terms of what's in the pipeline or how we work with the sales teams in terms of forecasting. I've not noticed a difference, if you will, in close rates between a virtual machine and a physical machine. Ken Xie : Yes, we probably would do some more deep study to maybe on Analyst Day, we'll give some color next year and also some midterm model on November 18 which also the 15 anniversary of IPO. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Aaron Ovadia, Director of Investor Relations. Aaron Ovadia : Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. Fortinet will be attending investor conferences hosted by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer during the third quarter. We will also be holding an Analyst Day on November 18 where we expect to update our medium-term financial model. The webcast link will be posted on the events in the Presentations section of Fortinet's Investor Relations website. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me.

Lastly, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. I will now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Xie : Thank you, Aaron and thank you to everyone for joining our call. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong execution and continued growth momentum, including record gross margin and operating margin with operation margin increased by 830 basis points to over 36%. Total revenue growth of 13% as we returned to positive building and product revenue growth. Unified SASE building growth of 14%, secure operation building growth of 32% and secure networking returned to positive growth all driven by a continued share gain in our total addressable market of $284 billion. As highlighted on Slide 11 of the investor presentation, Fortinet continued to be the only vendor to leverage a single operating system for the U.S., delivering solution with 5 secure network in dynamic quality report, secure service edge, SD-WAN, single vendor network firewall and Enterprise wireless line infrastructure. For the U.S., combined with proprietary for ASIC technology significantly boost secure computing power delivered 5x to expect performance than our competitors while lower customers' total cost ownership and energy consumption. In the third quarter, Unified SASE building was 23% of our business, up 1.5 points, driven by secured building growth of 220 with pipeline up 130%. Fortinet is the only vendor offering all SASE functions in a single operation SIM and providing a unified networking security stack on-premise and in the -- this allows FortiSASE to be deployed within minutes from our SD-WAN customers. Our SBS-based FortiSASE also enable sovereign SASE for service providers and large enterprise to deploy FortiSASE with their own data center for data privacy. In addition, we were recently recognized as a clear leader in the 2024 government magic quadrant for SD-WAN for the fifth consecutive year and notably position highest of all vendors in ability to execute for the fourth year in a row, leveraging leading position in firewall and SD-WAN and our integrated FortiSASE within the same FortiOS, provide easiest and most secure path for migrating from traditional firewall to secure SD-WAN and Unified SASE. [Indiscernible] invest in our global infrastructure over 3 million square feet of across office space, briefing center, operation facility and data centers. Our own hosting capability gives us a long-term cost advantage were allowing us to use our own Fortistack for better security and management. Security operation was our fast-growing pillar outpacing the overall market with a 32% building growth, accounting for 10.5% [ph] of our total business, up 2 points. We have expanded our secured operation portfolio with the launch of [indiscernible] which together represent a new $20 billion market opportunity. And we expect to cross-sell both solutions to a large installed base of customers. Our commitment to innovation and investment in R&D has enabled us to rapidly expanding FortiAI, our GenAI system into 7 key solutions. FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiSIM, FortiDLP and recently announced FortiNDR and FortiCNAPP. GenAI for FortiAI will be announced in early 2025, as Fortinet AI-based secure operation business are accelerating. Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners and suppliers worldwide for their continued support and hard work. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Thank you, Aaron and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the third quarter. We are very pleased with our strong execution and financial performance in the third quarter, repeating our second quarter performance by again achieving record gross margins and record operating margins while delivering top line results at the top of our guidance range. Total revenue grew 13%, driven by strong growth in services revenue and product revenues returned to growth. We again added over 6,000 new logos driven by the resilience of small enterprise customers and the strength of our robust channel partner, as you'll hear in a moment, we are pleased to again raise our revenue and operating margin guidance for the full year. And we believe we are on track to achieve our seventh consecutive year of exceeding the rule of 40. Looking at billings in more detail, RPO grew 15% to $6.1 billion and total billings grew 6% to $1.58 billion, driven by robust growth in security operations at 32% and Unified SASE at 14%. SSE and related cloud technologies, were again the fastest growers in Unified SASE, benefiting from our large SD-WAN customer base. Our Unified SASE and security operation pillars are gaining considerable traction with over 50% of their billings coming from our secure networking installed base and combining to drive our SaaS solution, organic ARR growth rate of 74%. The customer buying journey from FortiGate to SD-WAN to SASE supports our customers drive towards consolidation and is gaining traction. This consolidation journey first begins with a firewall in 40 OS and typically expands to SD-WAN and next to SASE. I should share that 2/3 of our large and mid-enterprise customers have deployed our SD-WAN technology, providing them with a gateway to FortiSASE. These are our customers, our first year of SASE delivered high mid-single-digit penetration rates, highlighting both the dramatic expansion opportunity as well as customer demand for vendor consolidation. Including all elements unified SASE, pipeline growth was over 30%. And while the SSE technologies are seeing pipeline and ARR growth of 130% and over 500%, respectively. Larger enterprises continue to drive our expansion into Unified SASE and the security operation markets with large and mid-enterprises representing 91% and 76% of SASE and Secop's billings, respectively. As we work through the wind-down of last year's backlog and the related year-over-year headwind to growth this year, secured networking has returned to growth as we expected. Rounding out the buildings commentary, SMB and large enterprise were our top 2 performing customer segments, while EMEA was our best-performing geography with double-digit growth. Among our top 5 verticals, manufacturing billings grew by over 20%, driven by OT billings of 119%. Retail returned to growth for the first time in 6 quarters, up 9%, while the service provider vertical reached its highest growth rate over that same 6 quarter period. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 13% to $1.508 billion, driven by 19% service revenue growth and product revenues returned to growth. Service revenue of $1.034 billion grew 19% accounting for 69% of total revenue. Service revenue growth was driven by growth in our SaaS solutions, including 50% services growth in SecOps and 27% services growth in Unified SASE. Product revenue returned to growth for the first time in 5 quarters, increasing 2% to $474 million. Excluding the impact of backlog, product revenue grew sequentially at double-digit rates, outpacing historical norms for Q2 to Q3. And following a similar storyline on what we saw in Q2, with sequential growth also outpaced historical norms. A moment ago, we talked about solution consolidation and describe the customer's journey around firewalls to SD-WAN and on SASE. The second customer buying journey is supporting customers' convergence of security and networking. Their journey begins with Fortinet firewalls and expand to leverage our FortiLink technology to manage Fortinet switches and access points. It's worth noting that over 95% of our larger enterprise customers previously or simultaneously purchased FortiGate firewalls. At the same time, our switch penetration rate for these larger customers is around 50%, highlighting both our success and the future opportunity. Software license revenue continued its double-digit growth, driven by SecOp Solutions and represented a mid- to high-teens percentage of total product revenue. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud and SaaS security solutions, increased 33%, accelerating from 32% in the second quarter and providing an annual revenue run rate of over $900 million. Total gross margin increased 630 basis points to a quarterly record of 83.2%, exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 320 basis points. Gross margin benefited from higher product and service growth margins as well as a 4-point mix shift to higher-margin service revenue. Product margin of 71.6% was also a quarterly record and increased 1,370 basis points which includes a 320 basis point benefit related to the renegotiation of supplier contractual commitments. Excluding this onetime benefit, the product gross margin would have been 6.4% [ph]. Service gross margin of 88.4% [ph] increased 130 basis points as service revenue growth outpaced labor cost increases and benefited from a mix shift towards higher-margin FortiGuard security subscription services. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to a quarterly record of 36.1% and was 360 basis points above the high end of our guidance range. Excluding the onetime benefit to product gross margins, operating margins would have been 35.1%. Taken together with our reported Q2 margins, the Q3 margins, excluding the onetime benefit, provide directional insights to our financial performance. Before moving on to the statement of cash flows, I'd like to provide a few details related to the impact of Lacework and next VLP acquisitions. These acquisitions increased Q3 billings and revenue by approximately 60 and 90 basis points, respectively and increased gross and operating margins by about 30 and 220 basis points, respectively. And as most decreased gross margin and operating margins. Looking at the statement of cash flow summarized on Slides 16 and 17. Free cash flow was $572 million, representing a margin of 38%. And adjusted for real estate investments, the margins came in at 40%. In the first 9 months of the year, free cash flow was $1.5 billion or $1.75 billion after adjusting for real estate investments. Cash taxes were $140 million, up $114 million, reflecting the prior year's regulatory extensions of estimated tax payments. Infrastructure investments totaled $36 million. The average contract term in the third quarter was 28 months, flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. DSO decreased 6 days year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to 62 days, reflecting stronger than usual linearity. The $106 million gain on bargain purchase from the Lacework acquisition relates to NOL carryforwards and the related recognition of the deferred tax assets. The gain is excluded from our non-GAAP financials but it is included in the GAAP financials, adding $0.14 per share to our GAAP EPS. Share buybacks in the quarter totaled $600. And last month, the Board increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion, bringing our remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $2 billion. Now, I'd like to share a few significant wins from the third quarter. First, in a 7-figure upsell deal, an existing SD-WAN customer in the retail industry, continued their consolidation journey, adding FortiSASE for 16,000 users. This customer selected our FortiSASE solution for simplicity, ease of management and consistent security enforcement across our infrastructure. We outperformed the competition by leveraging our FortiOS operating system. Streamlining operations and reducing cost of ownership while showcasing our ability to consolidate multiple security functions onto a single platform. In another 7-figure win, a medical device company purchased FortiSASE to replace their existing solution. This customer chose Fortinet we simplified and consistent security management, significant cost savings and FortiSASE's enhanced functionality, particularly the bidirectional connectivity between their data center and remote users, enabling to push policies more effectively. In an 8-figure competitive displacement win, a multinational bank commenced their partnership with us by selecting our FortiGate firewalls and multiple set top solutions to secure their hybrid architecture. This customer was particularly impressed with our integrated security end-to-end visibility and automated response capabilities of our FortiOS operating system. Before discussing our guidance, I'd like to offer a couple of comments on the firewall recovery and refresh opportunity. During last quarter's remarks, we mentioned that the continued improvement in the days of registered FortiGuard contracts indicated the inventory digestion at end users was returning or had returned to normal. In the third quarter, this metric was stable, further validating our view that the firewall market is recovering. Today, we'd like to add to this commentary by noting that in 2026, a record number of FortiGates will reach the end of their support life cycle and we expect these customers to start to refresh cycle for these products sometime in 2025. Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our fourth quarter and full year outlook which are summarized on Slides 19 and 20, are subject to the disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Aaron provided at the beginning of the call. Before reviewing our outlook, I should note, we expect Lacework and ex DLP for those acquisitions, Q4 billings and revenue by 75 and 135 basis points, respectively and decreased audit margins by 230 basis points. All right. For the fourth quarter, we expect billings between $1.9 billion and [indiscernible] which at the midpoint represents growth of 5%. Revenue in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.62 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 12%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 79.5% to 80.5%; non-GAAP operating margins of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.62 which assumes a share count of between $768 million and $778 million; capital expenditures of $100 million to $120 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of $127 million to $177 million. For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $6.43 billion, to $6.53 billion; revenue in the range of $5.856 billion to $5.916 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 11%. Service driven in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.45 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 19%. Non-GAAP gross margin of 80.3% to 81.3%, non-GAAP operating margin of 32.9% to 33.9%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.28 which assumes a share count of between $766 million and $776 million. Capital expenditures of $380 million to $400 million, non-GAAP tax rate of 17% and cash taxes of between $550 million and $600 million. I look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Day later this month and updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. I'll now hand it back the call over to Aaron to begin the Q&A session. Aaron Ovadia : Thank you, Keith. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one on follow-up questions to allow others to participate. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Hamza Fodderwala : Ken, I couldn't help another thing in your investor presentation, you talked about a market that you see over $200 billion, growing 12% over the next 4 years. Obviously, a big chunk of that growth is driven by the SASE market and your share in there. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about Fortinet's approach in terms of Sovereign SASE. How is that differentiated versus some of the competitors out there? And what is it that you're doing differently, particularly for those highly regulated verticals out there? Ken Xie : Thank you, Hamza. It's a great question. We invest in the SASE for 5 to 10 years in the market, including our SD-WAN and also all the SASE function in the same FortiOS, both on-premise also in the cloud. So with huge differentiation without a competitor which they cannot run the SASE whether in the same OS or even different box. And that's for the sovereign SASE. We us call private SASE, actually -- if you look at probably 1 year ago, we were more focused on there with a lot of service provider which is quite important for them to play the SASE within own data center to process data and also to keep the data in their own kind of data center and also process also within our own data center. So that's the 2 important factor there. So they have to be local and to secure the data and same kind of pro data locally, so that's a huge advantage in the same OS and also a lot of function can use in FortiASIC salary. The other differentiation comes from the business side. So we are the number 1 on the network security firewall. We're also the number 1 on the SD-WAN. So leverage our installation base and also both the firewall function and also IT function the same OS with the SASE. So that for the customer, they have the most easy migration part from the traditional firewall vendor, I mean some traditional firewall customer to the SD-WAN customer go to SASE. It's only in a few minutes reconfiguration that can enable SASE based on their previous SD or the firewall contribution there. So it's a very easy migration path. As you can see, the pipeline growth and also the business is growing there from SSE like over 200% the pipeline grew over 100%. So we do believe we'll be the number 1 leader in the assays in the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes the line of Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Brian Essex : Stick to one topic. I guess either Ken or Keith, could you dig into the commentary around the firewall refresh cycle that you provided. So with respect to conversations you're having with customers and maybe with a little bit of color what you've seen historically, how far before the renewal point do customers tend to refresh? And do you have any insight into the mix of F&B, large enterprise service provider, retail and what the timing and the magnitude might be, whether this might be a first half event, second half event? Any kind of insight you could provide would really be helpful. Keith Jensen : Yes, I'll kind of jump in a little bit on this. I think that we see these end-of-life of these products starting in the second half of 2026. We don't expect the customers to wait until the 11th hour to make the change. For larger enterprises, they would go through another certification POC project perhaps as part of that before they place them in service. So we saw a similar -- not similar, we saw a lift, if you will, similarly in 2023, although the magnitude in 2026 is much, much larger. And why it's relevant to 2023 is that if you go back and look at product revenue growth in 2022, very different world, supply chain, switches, et cetera but I think in 2022, the product revenue growth was a little bit over 40%. So we do think there's a relationship there. We do think it starts earlier. To the second part of your comment, as I mentioned, the absolute number that we see in 2026 is by far the largest we've seen probably ever but certainly in the last 5 or 6 years. It is -- each year is dominated by the entry-level firewalls. However, in 2026, we do see a significant portion of that actually being in the mid-range firewalls as well. And that is a very unusual and positive situation. I don't have right -- I would break down by SMB or something else. So maybe, Christian, do you want to offer something more on that. Brian Essex : Or by vertical, I think you've mentioned before that you need large enterprise retail and service provider in order to recover. So if you have any insight there, how that -- how their cycles and spending patterns may impact, that would be helpful. Keith Jensen : Well, again, I think 2022 was a robust year for those industries that you just talked about retail in particular and partly manufacturing across the board. And I would expect that they would be active players, if you will, in the refresh cycle that we see in 2026. But Christian? Christian Agard : Yes. You were asking whether -- or how early customers would refresh. And many of the enterprise customers have enterprise agreements where they have account levels support and subscriptions. So they don't really wait until something expires. They will probably -- I would expect what we typically see refresh about ever before U.S. And for smaller customers, they will be try to wait until the contracts expire. But because we don't allow them to renew for less than a year, you also see the refresh cycles happening about -- yes, 15 to 18 [ph]. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from Citi. Fatima Boolani : Ken, a question for you. There was a discount about the routes to market in terms of gaining your market share within the SASE universe. And one of those important routes is leverage our installed base by converting and migrating a lot of the SD-WAN customers. So my question for you is how should we think about potential for the cannibalization of some of your refresh potential as that migration journey transpires from SD-WAN to SASE? And then I just have a follow-up for Keith, if I may. Ken Xie : Very great question. I think if you look at the customer, a lot of SASE is really supporting the DTA and also remote growth environment. So they are not kind of like any network security firewall deployment which tend to be more in the office in the headquarter there. On the other side, it's most of -- if you look at our current SASE growing strong is most come from the current SD-WAN customer base or even the firewall customer base here. So that's where they do need a hardware firewall SD-WAN layer to support SASE with additional SASE user license with addition all these other functions service add-on there. So that's where we see like a 3 pillars, whether the secure networking side and also the SASE side which will help add additional service and plus the other we call the secure operations side, all kind of starting growing. So we do believe we can keep in grow in all these 3 areas faster than the market, keeping gaining market share, especially SASE, the technology we can put out in the same OS with AC to accelerate and also supporting both the cloud SASE -- private SASE or Sovereign SASE is a huge advantage. And also comment, we also believe eventually, the service provider carrier will play some important role in SASE and offer a lot of their own kind of SASE to their customer. And so that's where we have very strong support in all the service providers build their own SASE infrastructure. And we do -- it's a huge growth potential on top of traditional network firewall market. Fatima Boolani : And just Keith, for you to double back on the end of support analysts around the refresh that you're talking to and telegraphing for 2026. Any way you can give us a lens on either the proportion of the shipment footprint or the installed base footprint or the customer footprint that this applies to in the aggregate? Keith Jensen : Yes. At the risk of taking all the fun out of the Analyst Day in 10 days, I would say the second -- 2023 was -- 2022 was the second best second highest I looked at. '26 is a little bit more than 2x '23. So you're not coming to the Analyst Day. Operator : Our next question comes from the line from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia : Maybe for Keith or Christian, I think we mentioned as Solutions ARR growth number in the prepared remarks. Could you just remind us, is that an organic or inorganic number? And maybe just touch on what are the solutions that are driving that growth? Keith Jensen : Christian, do you want to... Christian Agard : Yes. So the growth number that Keith referenced was an organic growth number. We did not include the ARR that we acquired from Next DLP and Lacework. So the growth would be even higher year-over-year will be 150%. What are the solutions, the organic solutions that are driving this out, ARR growth is really FortiEDR, FortiClients, FortiNDR clouds, FortiWeb, so a variety of our cloud solutions and solutions that we've started to offer. Some of them are acquired, some of them are internally developed. Saket Kalia : Got it. Keith, maybe for my follow-up for you. Just to shift gears a little bit, it was great to see the profitability again. Could you just remind us what -- you mentioned something about being onetime in nature in the quarter. It sounded small but could you just remind us what that was? And more importantly, do you think about this as a more sustainable level of profitability? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think if I were to use the headline first, I would say the pro forma margins, if you back out that onetime benefit, product gross margin would have been about 68.4%, 68.5% and operating margin, if you backed out that benefit would be 35.1%. As you may recall, we have 2 different things that are impacting our margins in that regard. One is the traditional excess and obsolete inventory calculation related inventory you have on hand, that's pretty straightforward in comparison. The second one is Q2 deliverables. And the operations team has worked really hard with last year negotiating and renegotiating those. And we saw a benefit there that kind of pencils out to those margins I gave you in round numbers, we got a benefit there of about $15 million. That's very unusual. We've not seen that in the past. Saket Kalia : And anything on sort of the sustainability of that margin? And if that risk pulling anything from the I totally understand. But I wanted to make sure the question was asked. Keith Jensen : Yes. I think we feel really good about the profitability of the business. And I think it comes back to where those investment vectors that Ken and John Will and others are going to really focus on as we go forward and how we want to invest there. But I think we certainly have ample room to invest in the growth of the company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : You have Tomer Zilberman [ph] on for Tal Liani. Just wanted to ask about the billings guidance for next quarter. The organic billings ex Lacework and Next DLP came in well below Street expectations. Just wanted to ask where you see the weakness and how you measure that against the comments of seeing stable firewall demand this quarter and the expected refresh cycle in 2025? Keith Jensen : Yes. Great question. And I think what we're seeing when we look at the fourth quarter right now, we're really pleased with what we got out of the very first month of the first quarter. And I think that the second month is -- it's early yet, it's tracking. We're giving us pause or some chunky deals that are teeing up for the final month of the quarter. And they just need to mature a little bit before we start thinking about them as part of our guidance numbers. So I think it's really that population of large 7-figure and a few 8-figure deals that are kind of coming into play there a little bit. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And maybe to follow up, asking more generally about the competitive landscape. We've seen over the last couple of quarters some of the larger vendors are now focusing even more on discounting, bundling and vendor financing. So how do you see the competitive landscape? Do you see pricing pressure because of that? And how are you participating with that as well? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think the -- maybe Christian will add a couple of comments here as well. But I think the discounting was very similar to what it's been in prior periods. As I mentioned, we certainly have ample margin to invest in a wide range of ways and we're encouraging our sales team and our channel partners to take part of that. But I think there's also been some other changes in terms of incentives that we offer as well. But maybe Christian have some thoughts as well. Christian Agard : Yes. I think that overall, the discounting will expect to be pretty stable. But of course, it depends on the product set a little bit. And then yes, we have incentives in the market for channel partners, specifically but also for our customers to -- yes, to buy more Fortinet solutions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Gabriela Borges : Keith and Ken, I wanted to ask you about the go-to-market. And more specifically, I think it's been about a year since you upleveled your sales force around SSD. What are some of your learnings? What do you think is working well? And what do you think is incrementally a focus as we go into 2025 where you think you can maybe up level some more? Ken Xie : Yes. You can see the last 12 months, we made a huge progress in the SASE SSD go-to-market directly. But also, you can see Q3 some service provider also starting -- finally setting turn worth now and realize the importance of the SASE into their customer base. But it's probably still takes some time. But on the other side, we see our own customer base really like the SASE and very easy micro from the firewall in into -- so that's kind of probably 90% of our SASE business come from existing or security and also customer. And that actually helped us sell additional service, additional margin there. On the other side, the technology we have, whether the single OS, the ASIC sell all this function, it was advantage and to expand beyond traditional SASE market which is only focused on a cloud-based society. So that's where we see the -- whether the sovereigns probably says even beyond go to the edge computing area with our kind of technology with appliance also CE especially for the OT/IoT area, both the hardware agents, software agent who's supporting all these OT device, we see also a huge growth potential there. So that's why we're pretty confident. So we're leading the SASE market and just like we did in the firewall SD-WAN space. Keith Jensen : Yes, I think, Ken spot on with that. I think that if you vary contrast where we are today versus a year ago, what I would say is that given the response that we get from customers when they meet with us, they're very excited about the architectural design of SASE that we've taken. And what we really want now is just more at that. When customers sit down with us and hear that story, it resonates with them and you see that in some of the pipeline numbers and some of the ARR numbers that we're talking about which are still very early days. And I think part of it is getting more reference customers involved. And I think also the channel needs to -- we need to partner more closely with the channel to make sure that we're getting more advanced on those SASE opportunities. Ken Xie : Yes. SASE also the infrastructure were also different than other competitor. I think -- like I said, we own the 3 million square feet of our own kind of facility which is our own data center can deliver the SASE function probably less than half compared to all the colon and then also kind of only 10% to 20% compared to some core provider but we're definitely working with them because they have also good coverage. So that's where, for us, we do have a cost advantage on the infrastructure side, plus on the OS technology on Acceleration can lower the energy cost within the data center within all the SASE processing, I think we do have a huge advantage, both on technology, from infrastructure and also leverage the business customer base we have on the firewall SD-WAN. So that's the advantage we have over our other SASE competitors. Gabriela Borges : I think it's also interesting to note, like you said, we started really focusing on SASE a year ago, like Ken said, we've been building the solution for some time, of course. A year ago, at the November '23 earnings call right around that we broke out those 2 other pillars, Sassy and SecOps, externally and also internally to focus on those pillars. And you've seen really nice growth when we focus on solutions like that over the past year. It's only been a year -- and I think it's a little analogous when you think about kind of Fortinet's ability to execute. If you look at SD-WAN which we started to really focus on in 2018 and then we've risen to be the leader in the Garden Magic Quadrant, it steadily grew over time. And so I think that those past results delivered around SD-WAN are illustrative of what can do when they focus on things. And we've really been focused on SASE and SecOps for that year. And so I think -- we had really good results over that -- over the course of that year in a very short period a lot more focus to come going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from TD Cowen. Shaul Eyal : Ken or Keith, in your press release, you're talking about Fortinet being well positioned to lead in its 3 core growth barriers and drive sustained growth. Keith, again, I don't want to spoil the Analyst Day front run it in advance but sustained growth, what are we talking here? Low teens, mid-teens? Any color will be highly appreciated. Keith Jensen : Yes. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to it but -- and maybe Ken walks to a little bit, although I would probably be careful what he says. I think we'll, obviously, we'll talk about 2025 as we get to the February earnings call and we understand that the November Analyst Day is probably going to bake in some of the 2025 conversations. So I think that's -- it's a well-structured question but I think we'll pause on answering it for now. Ken Xie : Yes, I agree. And so probably waiting for 10 days. And also you can in the investor slides, probably number 6, there's some information there. We'll probably provide more detailed information about total addressable market; how we want to grow faster than the market in each sector. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandlin. Rob Owens : Keith, I wanted to I guess, double back on your comments around Q4 and some of the chunky yielding up for the final month of the quarter, giving you a bit of caution. Was that not in your purview, I guess, when you were looking at the setup for the second half before? Have these things somewhat slipped relative to maturation, your ability to get them across the line. Just curious why the additional conservatism around them now? Keith Jensen : Yes, great question. And I do think that compared to what we've seen in other quarters, maybe a little bit less or a little bit slower progress on the maturation of those larger deals in the third quarter as they got teed up for the fourth quarter. Certainly not shutting them out. I just -- I think it's more prudent right now to take a more cautious approach and let them mature a little bit. Ken Xie : It's another fact. It's really probably the first time we also started gave the RPO number and compared 1 year ago, some of the deal, probably Christiana can give more detail instead of finance from the channel, get a building right away for multiple deal, some of them may just using IPO just bill annually. Maybe Christian know this better. Christian Agard : Yes. As you can imagine, the customers won't pay years upfront. And so we have internal discussions around either getting the channel finance or do it ourselves and this is also not mature enough be comfortable guiding in that direction but gives us some pause because some customers just don't want to sign up for long periods without financing. Ken Xie : This maybe has a little bit short-term impact but also benefit the company long term with better margin, better customer relation. So that's what we all looking for long-term success. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Rosenblatt. Catharine Trebnick : Can you discuss how your virtual firewall is performing this quarter or the trends for and competitively, we've been picking up that [indiscernible] have been doing a really good job with their virtual firewall. So how is that standing competitively with you? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think that the virtual firewalls have done very, very well. It is a component of Unified SASE as well as our network security portfolio. So -- and I think -- the other thing we look at is the crossover that we see which is a very strong relationship between [indiscernible]. Are you still there, Catharine? Well, I'll just finish the topic. I think another thing we will talk about later this month is just the strong overlap that exists between our enterprise customers that are buying both physical appliances and virtual appliances. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Adam Borg : Great. Maybe for Ken, just on the Lacework FortiCNAPP offering now. I'd love to hear a little bit about initial customer feedback, partner feedback and kind of near-term R&D and sales and marketing priorities. John Whittle : Yes. I mean I think the feedback we're getting is similar to what we felt, this is John Whittle, by the way. What we found when we did our diligence, great product, great engineering team. It's an incremental TAM of $10 billion for us. So it really opens up that incremental TAM. Now we have out security, endpoint, network -- and we have great threat intelligence from all 3. So I think it's very, very positive feedback in terms of the quality of the product. We're continuing on the road map to improve the user interface in other areas and really make it a really, really, really strongly competitive product. I think it's very accreditive against some who have kind of pieced their solutions together based on multiple acquisitions forming their CNAPP solution. And so what we find is, in that context, oftentimes, we hear this feedback from customers a lot, they're not well together. It's reportedly integrated but it's not Lacework CNAPP Solution was largely developed organically by them to all seamlessly work to us. We're hearing really positives on that front. And then also versus other competitors, we do have this broad suite of products that we can offer together versus other kind of single point, single product vendors who just offer snap. So we have real differentiators against the others in this space that we see working to our advantage. Ken Xie : Both company has a market-leading technology and the team there are also pretty strong. On the same time, also kind of bet as a company, so keeping hand-on solution -- integrated solution there and that's probably better than other competitors actually let our customer base, leverage our also strong R&D resource, both combined solution and also send a lot solution to supporting customer units, a new $200 billion total addressable market, I think it's definitely a huge growth potential, both in the in secure app but also in the SASE space. Adam Borg : That's great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just on the government vertical. Obviously, 3Q is important for the U.S. Fed. I know the Fed is a little bit smaller of a vertical for Fortinet. But maybe talk about the government vertical more broadly in the quarter and how you think about it in coming periods? Keith Jensen : Yes. To your point, we're not really aligned with the U.S. part of the market for us, the government part is more state and local as well as international government. So you don't really get the same sort of 9/30 benefit that maybe some other companies see. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Scotia. Unidentified Analyst : This is Joe Andrew [ph] on for Patrick Colville. Can you just talk more about how you're enabling or incentivizing partners to kind of lead with Fortinet SASE when they may already have existing relationships with more established vendors in this space? Ken Xie : Yes, you can see the Follet channel partner, you can see a lot of the actuality is our partner for network security and also SD-WAN to the very easy upgrade class to SASE. And a lot of also compared to whether the cost, the security, the performance, the flexibility at the broad range, we're also not better than any other competitor. So it's quite easy to migrate from some of our competitors to Fortinet but we do see some kind of acceleration there. The other part is also we have a pretty big SMB customer base. SMB went up probably only single digit has any kind of network security deployment. We also see that's also one of the fast-growing areas because they do suffer a lot of runway out these contents. So we do see there's additional segment we can grow and at the same time for service provider for big enterprise to do this private solvency strategy, that's also one other competitor can offer whether in the same OS or the local data center deployment within the customer premise there. So that we feel we have quite some differentiation can give us huge advantage over other competitors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo from Jefferies. Joseph Gallo : It was great to see the OT grew 19% billings growth. How should we think about sustainability of that business? And then are there any changes in that competitive landscape? Keith Jensen : Well, I think that very bullish on the OT market but the leadership opportunity for us. Ken Xie : Yes. OT is the other year, we already did the space in some report, we're the only leader in OT security. We do believe also investing this year for a long time. And also, we believe in the next 5 to 10 years, probably most connection will come from is a device level and which most of them probably have a difficult way to deploy the agent software on the have to use network security. So we see a huge opportunity this OT combined resulted edge computing with view, it's will be the strongest growing area in the next 5 to 10 years. And so leverage, whether the OS or ASIC technology and also the infrastructure we have, we feel there is a huge opportunity there. We'll be driving or definitely to have the long-term amount of growth. Joseph Gallo : And then maybe just to double-click on retail and some of the verticals. It was great to see that, that grew for the first time, I think, 6 quarters. Now that we're post-election? Like are there any verticals that you expect to rebound? Or are there any changes going forward over the next couple of quarters that we should expect? Ken Xie : We see the manufacturer already pretty strong in Q3. We feel the postelection properties as we also begin accelerating there. Also, the other one like a carrier service provider is out of the market. We still finally see some growth after probably 6 quarters. And probably some other like retail, like it's pretty strong growth in 2001, 2002 -- 2021, 2022, almost by the 100% growth in some [indiscernible]. So I think like that's probably will be most statin the refreshing cycle studying whether next year or '26, because we see the number of units in that space registered in a go through most like 4 years, we probably more reach to the time to refresh now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO. Keith Bachman : I wanted to ask two questions; sort of a micro and a macro and I'll just ask them concurrently in the interest of time. Keith, just on the SaaS penetration. You indicated on Slide 9, about 45% is with large enterprise. If you took out the SD -- and it's a very impressive figure. If you took out the SD-WAN. What would that penetration rate or share look like in terms of customer type? I'm just -- I'm trying to understand the SD-WAN versus the other bucket. And then the second question is a broader question but how are you thinking about Europe as you look out over the next quarter or 2? I know it's T plus 1 in terms of the election and what economic growth may be as a consequence. But just how are you looking at Europe over the next couple of quarters, not just in Q4? And that's it for me. Keith Jensen : Yes, maybe we've confused you or I confuse myself on Slide 9. I don't think that's showing penetration, the mix of customers. Keith Bachman : Yes. That's what -- sorry, that's what I meant but what would the -- just a mix of customers, if you took out SD-WAN of the SASE piece alone? Keith Jensen : You're going to find a mix of customers that more tilted to the larger enterprises, if you look at SASE alone than when you look at the entire universe would be my expectation. I think we said. It has -- when you look at dollar values, right, not customer accounts. Yes, Europe -- I mean, Europe was -- I think we mentioned on the call, international EMEA was number one. I think U.S. was number 2 in Europe is right behind them on number 3. It's a little bit like the SMB headlines that we talk about every quarter that the economy is well every worries about SMB and it continues to do well. I'm not saying there aren't pressures in Europe. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, I don't know that we're expecting anything like an outsized performance from Europe but we'll see how the quarter comes out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Janice Quek from CFRA [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : I just want to drill down in your hardware appliances. And if you can maybe just give us a little bit more color how the high-end family performed versus the midrange and the lower end? Keith Jensen : Good question. Looking for some numbers real quick here. So overall, I would say, mid-range and high-end has continued to be stable but not outgrow. We had a little bit more unit shipment in the end. I guess what we're saying is it's not going to jump off the page when we look at our numbers. Operator : Our final question comes from Gray Powell with BTIG. Gray Powell : So yes, it was really helpful to see the product level is growth rate disclosures on the slide deck. Within Universal Sassy, -- could you maybe give us a ballpark sense as to how fast the SD-WAN piece is growing? My understanding is that that's probably been under pressure over the last 18 months. So I guess my question is really like, do you see potential for that product to reaccelerate, particularly as VMware customers start looking for alternative solutions? Keith Jensen : Yes. I think we're -- if you look at our SD-WAN space and we -- I think we made reference to the penetration in the larger enterprises that something on the order of 65% or 70%. That is of our customer base. Greg, as you're pointing out, the opportunity for us to see greater growth here is by -- in white space accounts and bringing them on board with the FortiGate and SD-WAN solution and starting them on that customer journey that goes FortiGate SD-WAN SASE. I think you're going to get some renewals from the early adopters of SD-WAN here as we start looking into 2025 and into 2026, that would be natural. I think that those same -- just as we're going through a renewal cycle for SD-WAN, our competitors will be also and we've historically shown where we have a superior product like SD-WAN, that's an opportunity for us to just lodge the incumbents. Ken Xie : Yes, agree. If you look at the top 5 SD-WAN provider, we are the other one internally developed in with security and also the strategy of these things on the other comp acquisition, a lot of content also being sold after a core some of SD-WAN. So they're kind of a function of technology already stop developing in a few years now. And come up the refresh, we do see a huge opportunity. It's still very fragmented space but we do see a lot of replacement opportunity deal right now. And we also feel we are not only leading technology but also performance cost, energy consumption. So that's why we feel the SD-WAN, we're keeping accelerating and grow faster than the market, gaining market share there. Operator : This does conclude the question-and-answer portion. I will now turn it back over to Aaron for closing remarks. Aaron Ovadia : Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As a reminder, we will be holding an Analyst Day on November 18, marking our 15-year IPO anniversary, where we will share the company's vision for the future of cybersecurity and provide an update on our strategy and midterm financial model.

Ken Xie : Thank you, Aaron, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. We are pleased with our strong performance in the fourth quarter, successfully balancing growth and profitability, including a record operation margin of 39%, total revenue growth of 17%, including product revenue growth of 18%, our highest growth rate in six quarters, as we further strengthen our market leadership in secure networking. And strong growth in Unified SaaS and secure operation with Security Service Edge building growth of 85%. Each grew our unified SaaS building growth of 13%, accounting for 23% of our business. The strong UniFi SaaS growth highlights the value that our customers see in our single vendor SaaS strategy. We are the only vendor to organically develop a key SaaS functionality into a single operation system for TOS. Which email gateway might be linked to a firewall, SD WAN, VPN, secure web gateway, Caspi, CLP, and other innovations. Sincerely, unifying networking and security delivering enhanced user experience, and securing access to application across on-premise and cloud environment. This infar an SD WAN customer can be fully certified in the cloud or on-premise within minutes. We also are able to sovereign SaaS for service providers at a large enterprise. To host forty-five seats within their own data center. Enabling heightened control of their data and a greater connectivity. While leverage our forty AC technology to accelerate study function for superior performance, Additionally, Fortinet's AI-powered security unified management, and single agent approach provide consistent protection across all location and devices. Ensuring full control, visibility, and simplified deployment while also offering industry's simplest licensing and three x or five x. Better performance per user. AI-driven secure operations are counted for 11% of total billings, while AR grew 32%. We recently enhanced our secure portfolio by acquiring perception point. A leader in advanced email and collaboration security. These acquisitions strengthen our end-to-end cybersecurity by extending protection beyond email to the entire modern workspace. Addressing the growing advanced threat risk in today's elevated threat environment, Insecure networking, We continue to lead inventory with a convergence and consolidation strategy a mission we have been dreaming for twenty-five years. Industry forecasts predict that secure networking will surpass traditional networking by 2026. As the number one secure networking vendor Fortinet secured over half of all global firewalls and lead the convergence trend. Also, I show on slide four, Fortinet continue to be the only vendor to leverage a single operating system for g o s. Across five secure networking, Guardant Magic Quadrant, customer are increasingly recognized that our Forti OS and forty ASIC technology delivering a five x or ten x better performance than competitors. By enhancing security effectiveness and reducing total cost of ownership. This is especially evident in the operation technology where OT cells approached one billion in 2024. Today, we introduced the forty gigahertz thirty g fifty gs, and the seven gs next generation firewall and a unified SaaS solution. Designed for SMB and a distributed enterprise. With cutting edge performance and enhanced security delivering up to five x to ten x faster support, and better threat protection than industry average and supporting a wide range of secure network interface for remote access. In addition, we recently acquired Remini share of Linksys Leading provider of connectivity solution to expand our enterprise-grade security to employees working remotely home business, and consumers. Lastly, I'm very proud to share that Fortinet was recently recognized on Forbes most trust company in our market list. Ranked number seven overall and only cybersecurity company in the top fifty list. Highlighting our transparency and commitment to our customer as the most trusted cybersecurity company. I would like to thank our employees customers, partners, and suppliers worldwide for their container support and hard work. I will now turn the call over to Keith. Keith Jensen : Thank you, Ken. Thank you, Aaron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with the key highlights from the fourth quarter. We delivered strong execution and financial performance, with top-line results above the high end of guidance, together with record operating margins at 39%, total revenue grew 17%, driven by strong product and service revenues, as product revenue growth pushed up to 18%. In addition, we added a record 6,900 new logos, driven by close alignment with our channel partners. Looking at our financial results in more detail, total billings grew 7% to $2 billion, including double-digit security operations and unified Sassy growth, RPO grew 12% to $6.4 billion ARR growth was very strong for SecOps and grew 32% and Unified SaaS, which grew at 28% to a combined total of over $1.5 billion. Within Unified Sassy, SSE continues to gain traction. With ARR growth of 96% As we continue to see early success, upselling forty SASE to our large SD WAN customer base, Forty Sassy deals increased over 60% and the pipeline was up 90%. Typical forty Sassy journey as for the customer's first purchase of our ASIC-based market-leading FortiGate firewall, followed by an expansion to SD WAN, and then to our single vendor SASE solution. The expansion journey is particularly significant as over 70% of our large enterprise customers have adopted our SD WAN functionality, and are poised to expand to forty Sassy. Our large enterprise forty Sassy penetration rate increased to 10% That's up two points just since our November Analyst Day reporting. Rounding out the billings commentary, deals between $5 million and $10 million increased over 90% SMB was our top-performing customer segment, with growth of over 30%. And EMEA was our best-performing geography. Driven by growth of over 25% from international emerging. Among our top five verticals, worldwide government, the service provider both grew over 20%, while financial services saw the expected challenge from the difficult year-over-year comparison I'm driven by several seven and eight-figure deals in the fourth quarter. Of 2023. Turning to revenue and margins. Total revenue grew 17% to $1.66 billion Product revenue increased 18% to $574 million Our highest growth rate in six quarters driven by hardware revenue growth of 19%, On a sequential basis, product revenue increased 21% and represents the third quarter in a row with elevated sequential growth. Software license revenue continued its double-digit growth. Represented a mid to high teens percentage of total product revenue. Service revenue of $1.09 billion grew 17% to 65% of total revenue. Service revenue growth was driven by SaaS solutions at 130% which includes the Wayzworks, as well as strong organic services growth in Unified Sassy and SecOps. Combined revenue from software licenses and software services such as cloud, Lacework, and other SaaS security solutions increased 41% and provides an annual revenue run rate of over $1 billion Total gross margin increased 340 basis points to 81.9% and exceeded the high end of the guidance range by 140 basis points. Product gross margin of 69.3% increased 920 basis points as inventory-related charges normalized from last year's highly elevated levels, adding 840 basis points to product gross margin, and 290 basis points to total gross margin. Service gross margin of 88.6% increased 50 basis points to a quarterly record as service revenue growth outpaced labor and hosting cost increases while benefiting from the mix shift towards higher margin forty Guard security subscription service as well as some early AI-related savings. Operating margin increased 720 basis points. To a record 39.2% was 520 basis points above high end of the guidance range. Reflecting the strong gross margin, an FX tailwind of about 110 basis points as well as the top-line overperformance that flow through to the bottom line. Before moving to the statement of cash flows, I'd like to summarize the financial impact from the lacework NEXBLP and Perception Point acquisitions. These acquisitions increased fourth quarter billings by 115 basis versus our expectation of 75 basis points. And decreased operating margin by 190 basis points versus our expectation of a decrease of 230 basis points. Looking to statement of cash flow summarized on slides eighteen through twenty-one. Free cash flow was $380 million and free cash flow margin was 23% up eleven points. Adjusted free cash flow was $549 million representing a margin of 28% up sixteen points. Cash taxes were $156 million down $186 million reflecting the prior year's regulatory extension of estimated tax payments. While infrastructure investments were $98 million or up. Seventy-one million. Average contract term in the fourth quarter was twenty-nine months. Down one month year over year, up one month quarter over quarter. DSO decreased ten days reflecting improved linearity year over year. And the remaining share back buyback authorization is $2 billion. Moving to an overview of our 2024 full-year results. Billings exceeded $6.5 billion while total revenue grew 12% to $5.96 billion driven by revenue growth of around 25% for both Unified SaaS and SecOps. Service revenue grew 20%. To $4.05 billion driven by a 22% increase in security subscriptions, and 33% growth in Unified SaaS services. Gross margin was up 390 basis points to 81.3%. Benefiting from the revenue mix shift to service revenue. And a 140 basis point tailwind of inventory-related charges normalized during the year. Our to a record 35% resulting in operating income of $2.1 billion which was up 38%. Our GAAP operating margin at 30.3% continues to be one of the highest in the industry. Earnings per share increased 45% to $2.37 Free cash flow was a record $1.9 billion representing a margin of 32%. Adjusted free cash flow was $2.2 billion representing a margin of 37%. If I were to just sum up 2024, I think it's important to note that we have now met or exceeded the rule of forty-five for the fifth consecutive year. Now I'd like to share a few significant fourth-quarter wins showcasing our SaaS expansion and our leadership in operational technology. In a seven-figure new customer win, the healthcare provider strategically included forty SASI in its first Fortinet purchase. Alongside SD WAN while replacing a competitor's firewall. With a new leadership team focused on vendor consolidation, reduced operating cost and complexity, and addressing technical debt, the forty OS consolidated multiple security functions onto a single platform. Modernized an outdated firewall infrastructure, and replace VPN technologies with a five thousand seat SaaS solution that relies on Fortinet's PoPs. Another seven-figure SaaS deal, an existing Fortune five hundred SD WAN retail customer purchased forty SASE for two thousand users with the potential to scale up to twelve thousand. It shows for an effort of flexible and consistent security enforcement, which enhances user experience while securing access to both on-prem and cloud app Locations. Additionally, they valued our strategy of building our own SaaS delivery infrastructure. Powered by our proprietary ASIC technology. And lastly, in a high seven-figure deal, a large energy energy company expanded its partnership with us by signing its first enterprise agreement to protect this global critical infrastructure. This customer secures its infrastructure using forty gates across approximately a thousand sites spanning branch locations, data centers, and cloud environments. Key factors in this win included our ability to support their global critical infrastructure both technically into world-class support programs. Our leadership in OT infrastructure capabilities and the automation and seamless integration of our forty OS system. So With Fortis supplying over fifty percent of the firewalls worldwide, Fortis security solutions themselves have become critical infrastructure protecting the critical infrastructure. In a in a threat landscape where there have been a has been a step level increase sophistication, In risk. Given our scale, innovation, and broad adoption, and national cybersecurity agencies around the world view our partnership as key to protecting the most important customers and entities in this dynamic landscape. Next, I'd like to review some of our key AI solutions for threat intelligence Networking. Knock in sock, Intel LM leakage. For threat intelligence, FortiGuard AI-powered security services combined with real-time threat intelligence helps organizations combat known combat known unknown, zero-day, and emerging AI-based threats. For networking, For the AIOps reduces the time needed to diagnose networking issues. Monitoring trend trends of the network, and with full access to logs across a four net security fabric, our AI engine uses machine learning to understand the optimal conditions for the network and highest potential issues. For the knock and sock, forty AI uses natural language and generative AI. To guide, simplify, and automate analyst activities. Forty a I is integrated into seven different network and security operation products. With additional products to be added. For LLM leakage, our AI-based DLP services actively identify and block sensitive information from being uploaded or shared with AI systems. Before discussing our guidance, I'll offer a few updates on the record level firewall upgrade opportunity that we shared during our November Analyst Day. In the fourth quarter, we saw early upgrade movement with large enterprises. Both on buying plans and actual purchases. We expect the moment the momentum to build as we move into the second half of 2025 As we get closer to the 2026 end of service dates, So 2026 and 2027 cohorts. Present a substantial upsell opportunity for SAPI switches, access points, sec ops solutions. To maximize our upgrade and cross-sell potential. Implementing several initiatives, including creating sales plays for each customer segment and key vertical. Expanding our account plans for larger enterprises to more specifically target the upgrade and expansion opportunities, In collaborating with our channel partners on SMB opportunities, incentive programs, end-user data, and developing targeted bundle offerings for these customers. Moving on to guidance, As a reminder, our first quarter and full-year outlooks are summarized on slides twenty-three and twenty-four. Are subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Aaron provided at the beginning of the call. I should note, we expect Linksys and PerceptionPoint to increase fourth-quarter billings and revenue growth by approximately ninety basis and decreased operating margin around forty basis points. For the full year, we expect Linksys and PerceptionPoint to increase billings and revenue growth by approximately one hundred and twenty-five basis points. And decreased operating margin by around fifty basis points. For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.6 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 11%. Revenue in the range of $1.5 billion, to $1.56 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of 13%. Non to cap gross margin of eighty to eighty-one percent. Non-GAAP operating margin of thirty percent to thirty-one percent, Non-GAAP earnings per share of fifty-two cents to fifty-four cents, which assumes a share count of between seven seventy-four million dollars and seven eighty million infrastructure investments of eighty to one hundred million dollars, a non-GAAP tax rate of eighteen percent, and cash taxes of thirty to thirty-five million. Dollars For the full year, we expect billings in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion. Which at the midpoint represents growth of twelve percent. Revenue in the range of $6.65 billion to $6.85 billion which at the midpoint represents growth of thirteen percent. Service revenue range of $4.575 billion to $4.725 billion. Which at the midpoint represents growth of fifteen percent. Non-GAAP gross margin of seventy-nine to eighty-one percent. Non-GAAP operating margin of thirty-one to thirty-three percent, Non-GAAP earnings per share of two dollars and forty-one cents to two dollars and forty-seven cents. Which assumes a share count of between seven hundred seventy-three and seven hundred eighty-three million. Infrastructure investment's up three hundred and eighty to four hundred and thirty million. And non-GAAP tax rate of eighteen percent. Cash taxes between five hundred twenty-five and five hundred seventy-five million. And on a personal note, you have made read in today's eight k filing that after four-decade career in finance, including eleven years of Fortinet, It's time for me to enjoy retirement. I'll continue to serve through the next quarter earnings call. And up to May fifteenth. And plan to stay at Fortinet to help with the transition through June thirtieth. Importantly, leaving Portnet in very good hands. Pursuant to our succession plan, Christiana Olgaard who as discussed in the eight k, has served in various roles at CordNet for almost six years, Will take over as CFO at my step down in May. I'd like to thank Ken, Michael, and the Fortinet team and all of you for making this chapter in my life so rewarding. I very much appreciate the time I've had at PortNet working with Ken, Michael, the entire team, and certainly with investors and financial analysts. I know on this one, that is people, customers, it's noble mission to protect and serve important customers and entities, around the world. Ken Xie : Thank you, Keith, for your great service and contribution. And Christiana, we're looking forward to working with you in your new role. To continue to drive the success and footprint So I will now hand the call over to Aaron for the Q&A session. Aaron Ovadia : Thank you, Ken. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to allow others to participate. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And as a reminder, to ask a question, please press Our first question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with MS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hamza Fodderwala : Hey. Thank you for taking my question. This is Jonathan Eisenson on for Hamza. First off, Keith, congratulations on your career, and best of luck with retirement and with your next endeavors. So, Ken, for you, so I believe some of the hyperscalers like Oracle, are big customers and partners with Fortinet. So just curious as you have Oracle and some of the other hyperscalers, building out new data centers, just curious to what extent Fortinet is involved in securing these. Ken Xie : Yes. Thank you. It's a great question. So, fortunately, it's only company we develop the secure ASIC processor It's increasing the secure computing Power quite a lot compared using general purpose CPU. That's a lot of our growth into recording internal segmentation within the data center, hyperscale, all these things. So we see a huge opportunity and not just the secure networking there, but also lot of our data center also related to the AI. We also see huge opportunity to drive the AI security, whether it's secure the infrastructure itself or secure the data. Or secure the access. So there's a lot of opportunity. I do believe that's the huge potential for growth because of unique advantage using the forty- eight Operator : Thank you. And we'll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Tal Liani : An honor for me to ask a question after John, my associate, across the line. But I wanna ask you two things. Number one is about the billings Why is billing weakened? Weak guidance? And that second question is product revenues outperformed so much this quarter And that might be a cycle, a reverse cycle, but the guidance for next quarter, I don't see outperformance. So why is it just the quarter phenomenon and you don't carry the strength into the next few quarters? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yes, Tal. I wasn't sure on your first question about billings if you were asking about the fourth quarter or the first quarter. Tal Liani : Sorry. I'm asking billing in general. So billing for the fourth quarter was better, but billing for the first quarter is weaker. So why is the weakness in bidding? Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think yeah. I think the if you look at the fourth quarter, maybe start there a little bit. As you recall, we talked last quarter the fourth quarter guidance process. There was a lot of concern around the eight quarter, probably the eight-figure deals and what we were going to get out of that. And we were being cautious in the guidance That that was a lot logically or rather a prudent approach, Where we got the upside was on those deals from five to ten million dollars and I would say the close rate and the opportunity there was probably forty million dollars to fifty million dollars more than what I anticipated in the guidance setting process. And you saw that same overperformance on those larger deals show itself in the product revenue line. And then also we saw in the product revenue line, our significant growth in product revenue was in the mid-enterprise the mid-sized firewalls and the large firewalls. When you peel back on that onion, you start to see enterprise companies have actually started their purchasing of the refreshes that we talked about at the Analyst Day. So I think obviously that the information that news about q four is very good. I think if you look at in q one, whether it's billings or product revenue, probably just a little more caution there as we kind of got exposed to the tariffs here over the last week and we saw the reaction And some of the concerns for us were the more of a multinational footprint particularly in Latin America and Canada, for example, with customer footprint. A little more exposure there. And then, of course, the direct impact of perhaps some disruption in the US government where we do have a footprint also. So maybe a caution in that regard. Ken Xie : Yeah. The other problem may impact some of the buildings, really. We're more also driving the ARRPO, which a little bit different than before. It's more about building, but this is RPAR probably would defer some building to the future. But we'll kind of secure the customer with all these the platform, the unified SaaS approach. That's where the SaaS and the secure up tend to have a higher growth in the AI and IPO than the building. Operator : Thank you. One moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question is gonna come from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gabriela Borges : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I would love to hear a little bit more on the Refresh opportunity for this year. I know you've broken it out for us in product versus cross-sell in a couple of different ways. Wanted to ask you specifically about the implications for subscription revenue as you see the hardware come up for renewal and as you sell some of the networking components on the hardware side into your actual base So either for Keith or maybe Christian, how do you think about the implications for subs hardwire comes up? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Attorney, what jump in there? Okay. I think, at the end of this day, I explained a little bit that the Christian Agard : the existing hardware has subscriptions. In order to grow subscription revenue, we need to upsell and sell either more subscriptions with the same hardware or more services. So we are we have put plans and incentives in place for our sellers and our channel partners to do so. But that's kind of the prerequisite for us to grow our service revenues or accelerate the service revenues. Ken Xie : Yeah. Also, the new Howard tend to be have more capacity to run additional function. And better performance, that's also gonna enable additional service including a lot of new service we develop in the, you know, forty-five in the last few years. Mhmm. As a like, all this unified SaaS function and some other AI AI kind of based function. Not not gave the new new opportunity leverage a new hardware. Gabriela Borges : Thank you for the detail. Congrats on the quarter, and congrats to Keith and Christian as well. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment as we move to the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Essex : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Keith, I thought when you started with key highlights for the quarter, your retirement would be up to the top. Seriously, it's been a real pleasure working with you, and best of luck on the retirement. Well deserved. And, Christiana, looking forward to working with you. So congratulations on the appointment to CFO. You know, I guess the question I had was with regard to the know, the billings guide for this next fiscal fiscal year. Would love it if, you know, maybe Christiana, if I think you've done a lot of work on it. If you could unpack the assumptions behind that, you know, how much is upgrade growth of SecOps and SaaS, and how much is, you know, product-related refresh cycle baked into that? And maybe if you could share an exit rate, that would be super helpful. Christian Agard : So in our in our billings and revenue guidance, Of course, we have the two components. Right? Product is what we sell this year. Services is what we what rolls off the balance sheet mostly. And about ten, fifteen percent is from from new services that we are selling this year. And Our assumptions, of course, are as we presented at the analyst day that we a significant upsell component. But we also are planning to with certain incentives for again, our own sellers as well as our channel partners to drive new logos. And from an exit rate perspective on sir were you looking at exit rate for services Brian Essex : Well, I guess you're overall for billings, and then, you know, maybe if you can You know, help us understand how much product revenue is baked into that. But it's really trying to get a sense of the trajectory that you're you're baking in the billings to kinda get to that full-year billings guidance that you have. Christian Agard : The product revenue growth, we assume is around ten percent right now. As we saw already a significant traction this year, but yeah, that's the current run running assumption. Brian Essex : Okay. That's helpful. And is that does that require, like, a Like a exit rate in four q of, like, teens like, high teens billings growth or are you expecting a more moderate bill throughout the year? Christian Agard : Right now, it's more moderate. Brian Essex : Okay. Super helpful. Thank you so much, and congrats. Keith Jensen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Questions. And, Keith, congratulations. I hope you very much have an enjoyable ride into the sunset. It's been terrific. Partnering with you. I wanted to go back to some of the commentary you made on the tariff impacts I did wanna dig into that a little bit. So, you know, I think there is significant amount of uncertainty from these tariffs. They're in flux. There's some potential retaliatory policies being thrown around. So I both wanted to dig into some of the demand comments you made. And how far-ranging those are and how they are being contemplated in guidance. And then also from a supply chain perspective, how is that influencing or potentially impacting your supply chain and ultimately COGS and gross margin? Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I'll it's as you pointed out, it's gonna be dynamic time, if you will, in trying to understand where these may end up. I would say that for selling purposes, for demand, we have a fairly significant footprint in both Latin America and Mexico. And over the weekend, when the tariffs were announced, there was a lot of activity here internally Sunday night and Monday morning to understand what the destruction would be more about those economies and their buying habits, if you will, of our products. And I think it's that type of reaction that we're focused on. I would also supplement that way a little more context, you know, our forty Authenticator product, I believe it is, actually, it's a very small product line, but it is manufactured in Canada. And we were looking at what the tariff impact would be like that. And then by Monday night, all those things all bets were off. So, you know, we're kinda chasing it a little bit. Yeah. And we do have similar to our sales leadership in last America raising their hand immediately in what they were seeing and being concerned about with Mexico. Our US federal team similarly raised their hand and said, you know, there aren't gonna be employees in the federal government to sell to, it's gonna be challenging. So I just think we're acknowledging that it's a very dynamic situation right now, and let's try not get too far ahead of over our out of our season until we know more. On the other side, I think, in terms of tariffs, coming into the country or products, well, keep in mind that our pure US business is around twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven percent of our total business. So obviously, that That thirty if I'm gonna say seventy percent plus international would not be subject to the tariff schemes of the US. And that is I think there's obviously if we had to respond in some way, the market, I think the tariffs would be broad brush and would affect not only our sales and our US business for that remaining twenty-five, twenty-six percent, but our competitors are what as well. And I would expect that we would still, at this early stage, still have the pricing advantage that we currently have. Fatima Boolani : Thank you, Cristiana. Congratulations. Christian Agard : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Shaul Eyal : Thank you so much for taking my question, good afternoon. Congrats on the results. Congrats, Keith, and congrats, Christian. Keith, my question maybe builds a little bit on the prior question, but touches more specifically on your US performance. This year, you had, I think, this quarter, the best quarterly performance in 2024. Do you see that being sustained into 2025 given some of your prior investments? What are the plans specifically as it relates to US sales operations? Thank you. Ken Xie : Yeah. It's a great question. So I think probably starting a little bit over one years ago, we're starting as the US enterprise sales. And also more focused on, like, adding sales capacity and also kind of working closely with our channel partner to drive the growth. Which both in the in the in the high con and also drive the program with the partner there. So that that's we see some pretty good results. And so we do see there's a lot of loan to grow in the US. And at the same time, we have a huge advantage on the on the resource on the facility, on the on the people here in the in the US and Canada, the continual drive there. The future growth. So that's why we see that the US could be the fast-growing region in the in the next few years. Shaul Eyal : Thank you so much. Ken Xie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler Companies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rob Owens : Great. And thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could expand a little bit just on the Linksys relationship and what you hope it brings. And I know Ken, you did outline some expectations relative to revenue and billings, but just strategically where it positions you better. Thanks. Bye bye. Ken Xie : Yeah. This is actually we acquired about fifty-one percent of share about three years ago. And then we're keeping private shipping the company to more line up with our own kind of a secure networking strategy. But also, this all kind of a new market. We feel fortunate profits only payer complain in the consumer home-based network security. Because we have this technology like a a say. We have all this unified SAC and together with the links, it's consumer and also the huge user base, which they have twenty-five million active user and has been shipping almost two hundred fifty million device in the last almost forty years. So it's a leading brand and with this customer base, without technology, all this combined resource with few We can really drive the new market for consumer to supporting work from home and also to cover some SMB space. We see pretty fast growth. So that that's the strategy, but that's also probably take some time to continue to develop all these technology market together, but we do feel this could be a huge potential in the next five to ten years for the company growth. Operator : Thank you. And we'll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Heath with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Eric Heath : Great. Thanks for taking the question here and Keith, congrats as well. So Keith and Christian, I wanted to understand a little bit just ahead of the refresh opportunity that's starting in the second half. How should we be thinking about inventory levels in anticipation of that demand? Then secondly, maybe to follow on to Brian's earlier question, just the assumptions embedded in the product guide and specifically from the end of service refresh. Are you assuming half of that four hundred to four hundred and fifty million dollar opportunity happens in twenty twenty-five? Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I'll cover off the inventory question a little bit and then maybe Christiana can come back over the top and talk a little bit more about the model for twenty twenty-five and I don't know that we explained we'll explain specific dollar amounts to each individual item in that, but in any event, Ken and I have been at this for a long time. You like to see an inventory turns to two. I like to see inventory turns to five or six. I lose constantly on the inventory turns. We've gotten, you know, as we we've gone through the supply chain cycle here, You saw the inventory turns. We did very well with those storing inventory, if you will, on our balance sheet. If we got into COVID and supply chain crisis. And it really helped fuel the super cycle for us on our income statement. And with that in mind, you know, I think a healthy move number for us, I'd have to agree with Ken now, is probably in the range of two x with returns. And I would imagine that he would expect you could expect us to target that each quarter in terms of our inventory balances. Christian Agard : Yeah. On the linearity of the product revenue assumptions wise, there is definitely a compelling reason to refresh in the second half year because you can't you can't you can only renew for one year. We've seen refresh activity happen already, especially for large customers? And we will try to accelerate the upgrades cycle as much as we can. So we've assumed that there's a more gradual than kind of spiky upgrade parts. Eric Heath : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. And I tip my cap to both of you on your respective exciting next steps. So very clear numbers and a lot of helpful questions. Keith and Christian, maybe I'll ask just a couple housekeeping questions. If I may. You know, first, can you just remind us I think you touched on it a little bit. Can you remind us how big LatAm and Canada are just in terms of percentage of billings, And then maybe on top of that, can you just remind me of the twelve percent growth that we're guiding to roughly in twenty in twenty twenty-five, how much of that is organic versus inorganic? Christian Agard : Yeah. To your first question, LATAM and Canada are about fifteen percent of total business. And on the organic growth number, it's we expect about one point inorganic. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Ken Xie : Mhmm. Operator : Thank you. One moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Adam Borg : Hey, guys. I've got Max on here for Adam at Stifel. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last few quarters, we've talked about SaaS and SecOps billings coming primarily from existing customers. So as we look out into twenty-five, just wondering what the opportunity is for SaaS and SecOps to become a more meaningful contributor to new logos? And do you or do you expect that to kinda remain as primarily an upsell motion? Ken Xie : I think we do have a huge installation base on the NextGen firewall and also ST WAN. I still feel grow upgrade from laptop probably will come most of the new Unified Sassy. And that also will be the sale for the sales force and also for the partner. I believe the last few quarter, probably over ninety percent of come from leasing customer, which are already all firewall major firewall. And also, I see one customer which does give us also more advantage compared to all these SaaS only player. So that's where and that also the reason is also because we have the single OS. I have all these networking security with all this SD WAN and also all the all the function in the same OS. So it's very easy upgrade. On the other side, we do have see a lot of new customer and especially some big enterprise. Some of them Do have issue with some other Sachi player, and we do have a lot advantage on the better function, better integration, a single OS solution, and much better performance and pricing. Like I mentioned, probably suite five x more price advantage and plus our own kind of infrastructure supporting this kind of Lower cost, better margin, and the same time, integrate function to together is more easy to manage and better protection So that's my advantage we have. That's why we also put a confidence We believe we're not only we're leading the number one player in the MagGen firewall and SD WAN. We also gave us some time. We're also we're leading to become the number one unified SaaS player in the space. Keith Jensen : Yeah. And I think Ken's spot on in terms of the factors that's now build on one of those, which is you know, removing reducing complexity and reducing cost and making things simpler. You know, I was really impressed with the first deal that when I talked about in the script here when I talked to the sales team, which was a pure wide space account. Started off as a competitive firewall displacement, and we know we're really good at that and we know how to do that. But then to see them, you know, consult and collaborate with a customer and make it not only an SD WAN deal, which we've been a ton of sense, but also to get them in the boat on the SaaS deal. And I think that speaks to well, one of our very good sales team that brought that to the table for us But the evolution and the maturity that you're seeing in our own organization as we get more experience underneath our feet and our ability to branch out and sell into those organizations that are focused on you know, a consolidation play removing complexity and controlling cost. Ken Xie : And that also we have been looking for a lot of our long-term investment, like, in the single OS, in the hardware and also in the ASICs. We're the only ASIC designer in the whole space, and a lot of new ASICs design will drive the new SaaS function. We'll keep give us a much better performance, lower cost, lower power consumption, and also the sovereign strategy for service provider for enterprise for data center, we obviously a lot of growth potential. That's already the unique advantage FullInNet has. Operator : Thank you. And we'll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Shrenik Kothari : Hey. Thanks, Mark. Taking my question. Just really solid unified SaaS growth rates. You guys are seeing increased penetration among larger enterprises. Which in the earlier commentary was still building momentum. So just curious Can, provide an update on, start with the incentives, which are tied to about telling SAPI tech ops, and how did incentives are impacting overall, kind of, proper metrics, deal conversion, and yeah, and then I had a follow-up question as well. Ken Xie : Yes. Well, we do want to ask accelerate the training to both our sales team, the technical team, and also a partner. And it's a but they do see the long customer definitely see some of the long-term benefit of using a single OS to gradually adding more function and adding more security and easily upgrade to the next kind of security function they needed And on the other side, I think that we also need to keep in keeping to be higher and keeping at self capacity. And at the same time provide better training. On the other side, we see the feedback already from customer partner. They could see there's an upgrade of a SaaS is much easier compared to this new SaaS approach. And the much shorter sales cycle. And you can see since, like, we only launch our own SaaS approach a little bit over one year, and you can see the ramp-up is very quick and probably the fast-growing in the SaaS space right now. So we do see a lot of great potential going forward. Operator : Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jun Zhang with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jun Zhang : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Keith and Christian. Congrats to both of you. Keith, you mentioned SMB being one of the top-performing customer segments, which is a bit different from what we hear from some of the other vendors. I was just curious what is underpinning that demand, and what are you seeing that others are not Thank you. Keith Jensen : Well, I think the account program at four is probably fairly mature. I mean, Ken's been doing it for a long, long time. You know, I don't think, you know, we're scrambling to find channel partners, if you will. I would also give a lot of credit for Shiana and what she's done in her year here, which is really focused on the channel and getting to more senior levels with the channel leadership to understand what's important to them and how to structure incentives that are tailored to what the channel is trying to accomplish. There's just much more collaboration with channel partners today than I've ever seen before here. And so I think these you know, we had some fairly specific and targeted incentive programs in the fourth quarter that Chrisana helped develop, and I think those were, as you see in the numbers, the new logos and sixty-nine hundred and the mix of the business, extremely successful. Ken Xie : Yes. And I also see we have probably the best product because none of our competitor, not just small, has this technology, single OS with so many it's almost thirty function integrate in the same OS and with with about function about fourteen fifteen using AC plus. Accelerate. That give us huge performance and function advantage than any other competitor. Because the SMB, the, like, the three model we announced today, they run the same for the OS compared to some other big big box, bigger parts there. And that's where the SMB and even the long-term home users see some huge advantage using the same forty OS They can they can kind of whether connect to the enterprise or they can they can connect to the cloud and also this new unified SaaS approach. So that's where we feel, like, a technology product advantage gave us huge kinda unique benefit to our customer, SME customer, eventually can be the home user consumer space, which we feel is because so far, even in the in the in the US and Europe, the developed country, the SMBs still had only single digit of SMB customer has any network security to protect their network in there. So we do see there's a lot of growth potential. But how to address this technology need to be easy to deploy, easy to use, easy to solve audio, use AI. And all this. That's where we kind of invest quite a long time, and we do see it's kind of a long-term benefit of this long-term investment, also huge potential going forward. Operator : Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joseph Gallo : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Keith, congrats on the much-deserved retirement and congrats to Chris look forward to working more with you. It was great to hear about the early end-of-life refresh demand. In those early renewals, know, how was the average deal size increased versus four years ago? I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about the size of the cross-sell opportunity versus that four hundred and fifty million product refresh. Thanks. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think I tried to make a point that what we've seen, and I guess it kinda makes sense, is that larger enterprises are probably moving first. We expect that the SMBs may move a little bit later on the timeline You know, they probably have less advanced per purchasing departments and maybe less regulatory pressures and things of that nature. There's probably a lot of reasons for it. I think what you see in our large enterprises historically is they often have a deployment schedule. They may not necessarily take all of the equipment at one point in time, but rather take a certain amount each quarter, maybe nothing in one quarter, and more in the third quarter. And that it was that same buying behavior pattern that I think we started to see in the fourth quarter, which I'm looking back at. Some of these more regulated industries, also some technology companies, and we could see the swapping out of the mid-major products that are being end of life then taking on new products. And we talked to the account person about, yes, that's they're on the they are on that runway and they will continue doing that now over the next several quarters. Christian Agard : And let me add to what Keith just said. Regarding your question of average deal size. So at as we have a lot of large customers that have enterprise agreements, they pretty much have an ongoing purchasing habit of replacement devices that they build out during the EA. You don't necessarily see creeping up larger deals, because they negotiate at a certain point in time what they need for the next five years and then they buy as they are ready to upgrade. Operator : Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next Question. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer and Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks, and congrats as well for both of you, Keith and Christiana. Good luck, and enjoy retirement, Keith. You earned it. Couple of questions for me. Just again on this upgrade cycle, if you know the devices and you can ping and you know exactly where they are and when they get retired for the vast majority, can't you just be a little bit more specific on what was the contribution exact dollar contribution you expect from the upgrade in your twenty-five guide. And the second question is for Ken on Sassy. Great to see the progress and adoption over there. Can you comment though of how much of the adoption with the large enterprises is Against brownfield displacement of all SAPI solutions or walking into a vacuum. We'd love to understand how much of your footprint in your opinion has something that you need to displace versus you're stepping into a vacuum. Thank you. Keith Jensen : Yeah. I think on it's a great question. And keep in mind with the two-tier distribution model, yeah, we sell to distributors, we sell to resell to sell to end users. And oftentimes, it's SMB The quality of the data about the end user gets better and better closer you get to the end user with the reseller. And it's why you heard a reference in the script about the importance of working with them on data gathering. You know, there's a bit of an honor system when they register the devices. It may be more intuitive to us. And, of course, we get a device, you register it like our phone or something like that. But that's not what happens in practice, particularly in the SMB. And really, there's a heavy reliance there on the channel to spend time and energy if you wanna get good reporting and tracking on that. So we'll get better at it as go, and that's part of working closer with the channel partners. It is easier, quote unquote easier with the enterprise enterprise and understand the account plans and what they're seeing, but you're still only getting a partial set of information. I think the reporting and the information will get more mature as it go along. It's moving pretty quickly right now on us in terms of how we're developing it. Ken Xie : Yeah. For your second question, actually, you can refer to the presentation slide number five. So they do give some numeric penetration rate. I think for SaaS, it's around ten percent, a increase two point from, like, two months ago, and then I stay. And then so ISP one is not a not enterprise, probably about seventy percent. So that's where see with our leading in the in the the firewall major firewall market, and then that's actually drive a lot of SD WAN growth then also after SD WAN, the SaaS will be the next growth. We'll keep in helping customer build better security infrastructure. And in terms of your question whether brownfield or not, we are seeing some of our biggest sassy Deals. As displacement. So either legacy VPN providers or legacy SaaS providers Ittai Kidron : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.
