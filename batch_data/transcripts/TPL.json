It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Shawn Amini, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Amini. You may begin. Shawn Amini : Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its  financial results and filed its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. In addition, the company has posted an investor presentation that we will be referencing today. That presentation related to produce water desalination and beneficial reuse can be found in the Investors section of our website under Presentations. It is also posted under the Events section on our website, which can be accessed through the News & Media tab and then IR calendar.  As a reminder,  remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings.  During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL.  This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; Executive Vice President of Texas Pacific Water Resources, Robert Crain and TPL's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty. Tyler Glover : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Driven by the continued strength of our surface-derived cash flows, our first quarter 2024 results are an excellent start to the year. \u201cWater Sales, Produced Water Royalties, and Easements and Other Surface-Related Income and aggregate had revenue growth of 19% sequential quarter-over-quarter, which totaled approximately $81 million and accounted for nearly 50% of total consolidated revenues. This was another especially great quarter for water sales as it generated $37 million of revenues, which was nearly a company record. Our source water asset footprint, combined with our excellent staff were able to push volumes throughout the Permian Basin with 72% of volumes occurring outside of TPL's surface acreage. Oil and gas royalty production of approximately 24,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day also represents strong performance. Our near-term inventory of permits and drilled but uncompleted wells remain at robust levels, which combined high activity levels on our water and surface assets indicates royalty production will continue to perform well. On capital allocation, the company and our board continue to evaluate all of our options as the business continues to generate considerable free cash flow and maintains a net cash position of $837 million. This affords us tremendous ability to drive value throughout the energy cycle. I do want to spend the majority of my time this morning talking about some exciting news for TPL. As Shawn mentioned, we posted a presentation relating to produced water desalination and beneficial reuse, and I will be referencing those slides. Our remarks today will serve 2 purposes. First, to give an update on our technology efforts related to produced water and second, to give an understanding of the state of the produced water market in the Permian today, the latter of which has been getting an increasing amount of attention throughout the industry. Starting with Slide 2, there are 2 components to what we announced yesterday. First, we have developed a promising new energy efficient method of produced water desalination. Although water desalination can be done today utilizing multiple methods and technologies, the challenge has always been doing so cost effectively. Desalinating produced water also presents some unique challenges compared to normal ocean or brine water. Over the last few years, our team has been studying a wide array of technologies, helping to find something that could work economically at scale in the oilfield. It may seem both simple, yet counterintuitive, but we wondered if we could leverage a process that happens every day in people's home, water turning into ice. We began to look more closely at this process, which is also referred to as fractional freezing. At first glance, it seemed nonsensical to make ice in a desert in West Texas. However, after running in-house experiments and further research, we pursued the idea in earnest. We reached out to a leading industrial technology and manufacturing firm located here in the United States. Over the course of a couple of years, we collaborated on various ideas and techniques. After eventually finding success with a prototype, we quickly constructed a small-scale test unit in TPL's R&D facility in Midland. That test trial was a success, and we are moving forward with a larger test facility capable of processing 10,000 produced water barrels per day with expansion potential to 20,000 barrels per day. The second aspect of our announcement relates to beneficial reuse. If we're able to desalinate produced water economically at scale, then it opens up a world of possibilities in terms of what to do with that water. We've been conducting detailed studies in our lab to understand whether desalinated produced water could be used to grow various crops and native grasses. Our lab has a greenhouse, which is pictured on this slide. Here, we use various local soils and native plants to understand the impact of utilizing fully desalinated and treated water. In addition to the extensive in-house testing and analytic capabilities, we have also partnered with leading research institutions specializing in water quality, soil and plant testing. We have another parallel beneficial reuse program underway, as we are exploring a discharge of desalinated and fully treated water into tributaries that feed into the Pecos River and potentially direct discharge to the surface for aquifer recharge. Across both of these beneficial reuse paths, we are working closely with regulators and have made significant progress with both permitting and stakeholder engagement. Robert Crain, who leads our water team will discuss these desalination and beneficial reuse initiatives in greater detail later on this call. Ultimately, if everything goes well, our intent is to bring large-scale produced water desalination solutions to the Permian Basin. TPL has created a subsidiary called Transmissive Water Services LLC to house our desalination and beneficial reuse efforts. Transmissive is a wholly owned subsidiary of Texas Pacific Water Resources, LLC, or TPWR, for short, which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of TPL. We are currently in commercial negotiations with blue-chip upstream operators, as we move towards the next phase of constructing a larger desalination test facility. Interest has been incredibly high, as oil and gas operators understand how critical this type of technology is to keep the Permian oil and gas machine going. This first 10,000 barrel per day facility, which we refer to as Phase 2, will cost approximately $20 million on a 100% basis, though our aim is to offset a substantial amount of TPL capital costs with any commercial arrangement. Longer term, our intent and desire is to structure commercial arrangements that align with TPL's ongoing business principles of high-margin capital-light cash flows. We've had tremendous success with that model in the past, as our team was able to turn TPL's raw surface acreage ownership into a business that last year collectively generated over $250 million of high-margin revenue. So we have the proven track record. Sure our desalination technology and beneficial reuse advances get to a point where we can help launch a large-scale build-out throughout the Permian Basin. I'm confident in our ability to execute agreements and strategic partnerships in a manner that generates significant shareholder value. Turning to Slide 3, titled Produced Water Overview. These next couple of slides are for the benefit of current and prospective investors that may not be completely apprised at the state of the Permian produced water market, but I'd like to provide additional context around what TPL is trying to solve. The term produced water refers to the water that is a co-product from a producing oil and gas well. This water has very high salinity levels and contains oil and suspended solids and heavy metals. Because untreated produced water is not safe for crop irrigation or municipal use, there are 2 methods in which the industry deals with it. The most common method is to reinject produced water back subsurface. For many years, the water was injected into subsurface formations, either above or below oil-bearing shale formations. Due to the high levels of development activity and high water cuts experienced in the Permian Basin, the industry has begun to experience constraints concerning traditional disposal into both of these zones. The high volumes of deep formation injection is expected to cause seismicity in local areas, as injected water can find its way into natural faults. The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas, has responded by instituting numerous seismic response areas, or SRAs, in certain regions. These SRAs have put restrictions on how much water can be injected. The industry has since pivoted to injections strictly targeting the shallower formations hoping to avoid some of the faulting issues. Although injection into shallow formations does work, it presents additional complexity for upstream operators who plan to develop overlapping oil and gas acreage, which they would now potentially be drilling through a more highly pressured zone. The other common solution for produced water today is to reuse or recycle that water for oil and gas completion activities, otherwise known as fracking. Upstream operators can use raw produced or lightly treated produced water to complete new wells. However, given the sheer amount of produced water volumes that come from the Permian, even if operators were to use only produced water in their completion activities, the Permian could still have north of 10 million barrels of produced water that would need to find a home. Turning to Slide 4. The Permian is recognized as an oil and gas powerhouse. Oil production today is over 6 million barrels per day, which is more than other well-known oil-producing nations such as Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. However, 1 unique aspect of the Permian is its relatively high water-to-oil ratio. The Delaware side of the Permian has an especially high water to oil ratio of nearly 4x. Despite the high water cuts, robust drilling economics in the Delaware has driven a strong ramp in activity, which has generated a commensurate increase in produced water. Today, the industry is finding it increasingly difficult to handle all of this water. Given TPL's long-standing actively managed vertically integrated water business, this is a dynamic that we've seen coming for quite some time now. Over the last few years, we actively sought to increase our capabilities across every aspect of produced water solutions. This is why we began investing so much effort into desalination R&D years ago. We've also significantly increased our treatment capacity for traditional produced water reuse. And finally, we've made a concerted effort to increase our pore space ownership. Through various bolt-ons, we managed to purchase surface and subsurface pore space easements totaling over 100,000 acres. The pore space we've acquired, combined with our legacy surface position is critical in providing long-term solutions for produced water. In evaluating surface acreage to acquire, we often perform extensive pore space due diligence across attributes such as capacity, formation pressures and fault and seismic mapping. Although we are well positioned to facilitate traditional produced water injection for years to come, we knew the industry needed additional solutions. There's still a lot of work and testing to be done with our emerging technology so we are encouraged and excited with what we've seen so far. As we presented our technology to potential partners, customers and regulators, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We've received immense interest from operators to deploy the test facility near their development areas, not just in the Permian, but also in other major oil and gas basins in the U.S. I'm extremely proud of the team here for their innovation, dedication and talent and their efforts will be critical in sustaining the positive momentum of Permian development over the long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Robert. Robert Crain : Thanks, Ty. For those of you that don't know me, I run TPWR. I joined TPL in 2017 and Ty recruited me to help build out TPL's nascent water business. Prior to TPL, I led water resource development efforts for EOG Resources across multiple basins, including the Permian and Eagle Ford, excited to be here today and talk about water. Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide an overview of our technology, our targets for desalinization and results to date. As Ty described, we teamed up with a top-tier technology and manufacturing partner that specializes in industrial refrigeration and freezing, where they serve clients across food services, industrial temperature control and nuclear power plants. TPL collaborated with this technology partner to develop a thermal system specifically designed for produced water desalination. While our partner retains the patents on the equipment, TPL has the exclusive rights for the equipment used towards produced water applications. In addition, TPL has filed for a process patent, utilizing fractional freeze desalination to treat produced water for beneficial reuse. There are a couple of other competing desalinization technologies on the market today, with many of them focused on heat distillation. Heat distillation can require a temperature change of 120 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and additional energy to condense the vapor back into liquid form. However, our freeze technology uses less energy, as it recovers heat from the incoming produced water and requires temperature change at a fraction of what is required for heat distillation. With our current R&D test unit, we've been running extensive optimization testing, as we closely monitor time spent and pull down in freezing, the progression of ice formation, salinity reduction, anion and cation reduction and energy efficiency among other factors. We had power meters installed at basically every step, so we knew how much power is being used by each piece of equipment. We have a better understanding of the various trade-offs such as higher pressure and higher analyte production or reduced power consumption. We have gained a lot of valuable insights that we can now apply as we look to scale up and enhance our next unit. We have a target matrix that we call 75 cube. This represents our high-level goals for desalination. First, it is a 75% volume reclamation, which means if we take 100 barrels of produced water, we can churn out 75 barrels of fully desalinated and treated water. But we believe we're well on target to achieve this goal. The second goal is a 75% reduction in analytes. Here, our goal is to remove analytes of concern. Our desalination technology is not just about freezing, rather it's a series of processes as we seek to create a very pure water. Again, we have already far exceeded this goal. And truly, our goal is to treat water not just to meet every regulatory parameter, but to exceed it. The final element of 75 cube is a $0.75 per barrel treatment cost. This is where we have the most work left. The biggest operating expense item of any desalinization is energy consumption. As mentioned earlier, we are metering every aspect of our equipment and process. We're working hard to find efficiencies. In addition, we continue to work with the utilities and developers as we seek options and novel solutions for electricity prices. Given the abundance of renewable power of natural gas prices that are negative at times in West Texas, we think we can find creative answers to bring our power cost down. We hope with this upcoming Phase 2, 10,000 barrel per day facility that we can make further process optimization and cost improvements. At $0.75 per barrel cost in desalinated high-spec water, we believe our technology becomes economically cost competitive and environmentally superior versus traditional subsurface injection. Our desalinization process produces excellent water quality along the most important parameters. Almost all semi volatile organic compounds, SVOCs, and volatile organic compounds, VOCs are reduced well below the maximum containment levels. We have reduced PFAS, radionuclides and metals to trivial levels. In addition, we are working with premier research institutions to examine water analytes that are not traditionally tested. Our goal isn't just to meet the regulatory requirements, we want to exceed across every possible parameter that can be measured and tested. We are striving for the absolute best quality fresh water we can achieve. Turning to Slide 6, where I'll talk about our progress with beneficial reuse. There are multiple aspects our beneficial reuse endeavors. First is our greenhouse pilot. This pilot was used to test discharge and irrigation potential for various native plants. In our Midland Yard, we built a greenhouse where we gathered local soils from Loving and Reeves Counties, and then we planted various native plants in Alfalfa. We're working with New Mexico State University, which has 1 of the premier labs and research facilities for plant and soil testing. The results from this pilot have been very positive. Data from this pilot was used for railroad commission, land application permit. And TPL was granted the first permit in the state in February of this year. With that permit, TPL is expanding the facility to include an outdoor field of Alfalfa to study the effects in the natural environment. That outdoor plot is currently under construction. TPL will share water, soil and plant data from the Greenhouse pilot with regulatory agencies, operators and universities to help the industry further develop standards and beneficial reuse technologies. Lastly, we have applied for a Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, otherwise referred to as the TCEQ. This permit relates to discharging treated desalinated produced water and to tributaries in the upper region of the Pecos River. Given our multistep desalinization process produces high-spec freshwater, we will add that salt and alkalinity to match the Pecos River water quality. We will utilize a batch relief system to thoroughly analyze all water prior to environmental release. TPL's priority is to go above and beyond the standard environmental assessment to assure safety and longevity of the project. Now turning to Slide 7 for an environmental and regulatory overview, I've already discussed the latest on our regulatory efforts for the last couple of slides, but I'll just reiterate that TPL is committed to the highest standards of environmental stewardship. Our goal is to not just meet the regulatory standards, but to exceed it. As many of you know, TPL owns nearly 1 million surface acres and to surface owners, we have every incentive to maintain and enhance the environmental quality of our acreage. We consider our surface to be extremely valuable, and we've always managed our surface assets to preserve a sustainability attributes for future generation. Now turning to Slide 8 for our key milestones accomplished to date and further time line. We've talked a lot about the progress we've made already. We successfully tested a pilot multistep desalinization system. We've made significant headway on the beneficial reuse and regulatory efforts. In terms of our near-term priorities, we are working to move forward with a larger 10,000 barrel per day test facility and to execute 1 or more commercial agreements. We have begun equipment procurement. The facility is expected to cost approximately $20 million on a 100% basis. So our aim is to offset costs with any commercial arrangement. Longer term, should the next test facility prove successful, then we would move toward Phase 3, which is the development of a large-scale 100,000 barrel per day facility. With demand for produced water desalination of potentially millions of barrels per day, widespread desalination adoption would require significant investment from the industry. If we get to that point, it will very likely require additional commercial arrangements as we do not intend for TPL to be primarily responsible for self-funding and developing this infrastructure. Although the exact commercial arrangements remain to be seen, we have a successful track record of executing contracts that ultimately provide TPL with a very valuable high-margin capital-wide cash flow stream. That said, we have a lot of work to do before we get there. We still need to build this initial Phase 2 facility. We have a lot of engineering and technical work ahead of us. We need to keep driving costs down. We have to execute on our various beneficial reuse endeavors. We're very excited with our progress so far. The team here is working incredibly hard. The Permian needs to find a solution for produced water, and I believe TPL is going to play a key role in that future. With that, I will hand the call over to Chris. Chris Steddum : Thanks, Robert. Consolidated revenues during the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $174 million, representing 4% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $152 million and free cash flow was $115 million for the first quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter grew 30% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher royalty production, source water sales, produced water royalties and easements and other surface related income and partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL prices. Weak Waha natural gas prices have negatively impacted the natural gas realizations in March and April of this year. We do expect low Waha prices in second quarter 2024 to continue putting downward pressure on gas realizations, though we expect this to be somewhat mitigated by the stronger realizations that super major and large independent operators generally receive. Our realizations on oil continue to be very strong, generally at 100% of WTI Cushing. Our near-term well inventory remains elevated relative to historical levels. At the end of the quarter, we had 5.1 net permitted wells, 10.3 net drilled but uncompleted wells and 2.2 net completed, not yet producing wells. This near-term inventory gives us confidence that our royalty production remains on a growth trend. To conclude, TPL is in an enviable position today. Our balance sheet is the strongest it's ever been. We still maintain top-tier cash flow and profitability margins. Today's disclosure of our efforts with produced water desalination is a great testament to the team and to the multiple elements of upside the business has with its unique surface ownership. TPL continues to generate substantial free cash flow, and we are in the excellent position to drive value. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes to the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Hamed Khorsand : First off, I just wanted to ask about your water desalination. What is the reason to highlight it now? Is it the scientific breakthrough or do you think you're at a point where you can get revenue soon? Or is it really just to let investors know about the CapEx that's required going forward? Robert Crain : This is Robert. Thank you for the question. I think it's a combination of everything you just said. It is a capital investment, and we felt it prudent to let investors know and shareholders know that it is -- for now, it's a $20 million investment. While we're looking to offset that, TPL will have some capital burden in the near term. Additionally, the talk of water in the Permian is another reason and the press that we've been getting on our technology. We've played a very heavy focus on the regulatory front and also on the institutional research front, and we thought it prudent at this time to announce. Hamed Khorsand : And then as far as water sales is concerned, do you think this is a sustainable level? I mean last year, you had a record number, but it sounded like it was onetime related. Is this more sustainable? Tyler Glover : Well, I think second quarter of last year was a record quarter for water sales, and we were right there close this quarter. And looking at the sales schedule for second quarter this year, we've got some really strong numbers on the schedule, a lot of wells to be completed. So I think we will continue to put up strong numbers on that front. Hamed Khorsand : Okay. And last question here is that could you just talk about what your expectations here are with the capital you're adding on to the balance sheet? Is it just focused on the water business that you're now expanding into the technology. There was a Reuters article this past week about OXY looking to sell some land. What are your intentions here? Tyler Glover : I think our general capital allocation thoughts are really still kind of unchanged from what we talked about during the last earnings call. Certainly, we continue to look and different opportunities are available. It's a constant topic of discussion between management and the board. And right now, we're happy with kind of the direction and where that cash is. But it's certainly something that is always a topic. And we're always looking for the best way to deploy that capital when the opportunity arises. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Annis with Stifel. John Annis : I wanted to focus in on the announcement of your desalination and beneficial reuse efforts, which is really exciting stuff and timely given the growing sensitivities around impacts of oil and gas development in the Permian. To start -- and I apologize in advance for a dense question, but I wanted to try to get a better understanding of the beneficial reuse market and how the value chain works? With the freshwater that's produced from your process, can you talk more about the potential end markets, the size of those markets? Any green incentives that you would be eligible for and any potential applications for your process outside of the oil and gas industry? Robert Crain : Sure. This is Robert. I'll take that. There's been a lot of discussion on the beneficial analytes, and any downstream revenues that could come from the distillate water of beneficial reuse technologies. I think they're still emerging. There's a lot of discussion on hydrogen beneficial analytes such as lithium, water rights retention once this water is reintroduced. As those develop, our kind of marching orders was develop a technology and structure a commercial model that stand on its own legs. Anything that comes from a downstream revenue perspective will be great, and it will further help the economics of beneficial reuse. But when we look at it right now, we had to develop a treatment technology and a commercial model that fits within the upstream economics. John Annis : Got it. And then with the $0.75 per barrel treatment costs you provided in the presentation, you mentioned that it becomes competitive with subsurface injection, is that expectation based on the ongoing discussions you're having with customers? And then more broadly, how do you envision those commercial agreements for monetizing the water working? Robert Crain : We don't have a firm commercial structure in place. I think this is a new concept for the industry in general. And beneficial reuse is going to be at a higher price per barrel than traditional injection. But it still has to be economic in the sense that it incentivizes the drill bit to continue to turn. The commercial model and the structure of it is still being developed. We're in talks right now with operators what that looks like. I think it's going to be a blend at least for TPL. It will be a blend of the traditional water midstream pricing and how we structure TPR from the get-go. TPW and our capital-light [indiscernible] business, we were able to leverage our surface acreage to not have to take the traditional role of water midstream. So our role in that commercial model, I think, is going to be a blend of the two. John Annis : Makes sense. Then I wanted to understand more about the operational complexities as you scale. What, in your view, are the biggest hurdles or technical challenges as you move from a larger pilot and then ultimately to a commercial scale facility? Robert Crain : I think the regulatory piece is initially presenting some hurdles that we've tackled. And I think we're getting over. As we look at any beneficial reuse technology, energy consumption is 75% to 80% of the OpEx of any piece of it. And it's what we mentioned in the talk earlier, continuing to drive down cost on the energy perspective. It's why we went with this technology, but that's what -- that's the most work and complexity that we still have to do is be in that energy does take up so much of that OpEx cost is ensuring that we can find an alternative energy source to come in line with those projected OpEx costs. John Annis : Great. And then shifting back to your core businesses. You were able to achieve significant quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in water. Can you talk more about what drove that growth? And are you seeing any tailwinds on source water demand just with the increase of simul frac development across industry that are generally more water-intensive. Tyler Glover : Yes. We definitely are seeing some tailwind from simul fracs. Just the volume of water needed delivered to pad per day for those fracs is enormous. And I think the scale that we've built our business to is a huge competitive advantage for us. There's just not a lot of water providers that can provide those kind of volumes, with as far a reach as we have across the basin, especially on the Delaware side. So I think there's a lot of factors that are giving strength to that part of the business. Obviously, our BaaS surface footprint and the ability to move water further than other competitors is 1 of those as well. But I think we're going to continue to see strength in that business. And just -- I think the important thing to remember about our water business as well as is we're involved in source water sales for completions. We're involved in reuse and treatment. We've got pore space or produced water disposal and now with this beneficial reuse technology that we're working on. We're really setting the company up to be a leader across the water industry as a whole. So no matter which way that aspect of the industry moves, I think TPL is well positioned to continue to gain market share across the board. John Annis : Terrific. And for my last one, on the governance front, you recently announced the formation of a strategic acquisition committee as a standing committee of the Board. Would this mean that M&A will be a board-led rather than management-led decision? I'm just trying to understand how that dynamic will work. Tyler Glover : Yes. We've had an ad hoc acquisition committee in the past just to kind of bet projects that management is working on before we take it to the full Board and make sure that we've got buy-in from that committee. So this is just kind of formalizing that with a standing committee. So it gives management the opportunity to vet new projects, get some feedback before we take it to the full Board. So that's the purpose of the committee. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shawn Amini, Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Shawn Amini : Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company\u2019s website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our recent SEC filings. During this call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Tyler Glover and TPL's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty. Tyler Glover : Thanks, Shawn. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter 2024 results demonstrate the overall strength of our business as TPL has positioned itself at the forefront of the Permian Basin's emergence as a world-class resource. Performance was led by another outstanding quarter from our Water Services and Operations segment. We set corporate records across virtually every major water performance indicator, water sales revenues, water sales volumes, produced water royalties revenues, produced water royalties volumes, total water segment revenues, total water segment free cash flow and total water segment net income. Our prior investments in the people and commercial development continues to provide a substantial windfall for the company. Honing in on water sales, our team has successfully captured opportunities both on and off TPL acreage with sales volumes averaging 800,000 barrels per day during this quarter. Upstream operators utilizing simul-frac, trimul-frac and co-completions as part of their development strategies, are driving robust demand for TPL water as our strategically located infrastructure network has the size and reach to reliably accommodate ever-increasing demand for both brackish and recycled water. Our top 5 customers for water sales this quarter were Exxon, Conoco, Occidental, EOG and BP. Customer quality doesn't get much better than that. On the produced water side, we are reaping the benefits of our prior and ongoing commercial and contracting efforts as upstream and midstream operators drive produced water volumes into TPL's surface acreage. We collected a royalty on over 300 million barrels of produced water this quarter, which represents a 43% increase versus the same quarter last year. Our top customers here again represent some of the highest quality operators in the Permian, names like Conoco, BP, Coterra and Occidental. For our produced water desalination and beneficial reuse endeavors, procurement and process and equipment testing continues on our 10,000 barrel per day test facility, which we refer to as Phase IIb. We still expect completion of this facility in the middle of next year. CapEx related to these efforts is approximately $4 million year-to-date. On the beneficial reuse side, our alfalfa plot is currently operational and going very well, and we continue to make good progress on various permitting processes with regulatory agencies. As we discussed last quarter, we believe produced water desalination and beneficial reuse will potentially play a critical role in providing sustainable produced water solutions that will allow the Permian to maintain robust development activity. Oil and gas royalty production of approximately 24,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly from the previous sequential quarter. Encouragingly, our line of sight inventory has expanded to 19.8 net wells, comprised of 6.3 net permits, 9.5 net drilled uncompleted wells and 4 net completed but not producing wells. Furthermore, we saw a large ramp in new permit activity during second quarter with 344 gross and 5 net new permits. Permitting activity was especially strong in our Loving Northern Reeves and Central Midland subregions. This level of near-term inventory and new activity gives us a lot of confidence our royalty production can sustain an attractive growth trajectory. For the second quarter 2024, oil and gas royalties comprised 52% of TPL's total consolidated revenues, which makes it the single largest revenue source TPL has. Although commodity price volatility over the last year or so has dampened top line revenue growth versus recent prior years, we still very much consider oil and gas royalties to be one of the highest quality cash flow streams, not just within the energy industry, but in the market more broadly. As many of you know, oil and gas royalties provide owners a fixed percentage of revenues and production from oil and gas wells, but without being burdened by any capital costs and almost none of the operating costs. Although they do bear exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, their high-margin capital-light attributes, meaning that even during periods of depressed commodity prices, royalties can still generate significant positive free cash flow. This is especially pertinent during periods of high and persistent inflation like we've experienced over the last few years. Rising development expenditures and labor expenses effectively raises the global oil supply cost curve. Thus, for operators to hit the same pre-inflationary return targets, they would need higher commodity prices. In other words, operators are constantly fighting a battle where cost inflation diminishes their returns and less commodity prices eventually rise commensurately. However, from the royalty owners perspective, higher upstream development costs do not directly impact our economics. Over the long term, as commodity prices potentially reset higher in response to a structurally higher global supply cost curve, then royalty owners capture the incremental revenue upside without bearing the burden of higher expenses. As we've discussed many times before, over the years, we've actively searched for external assets that look like TPL across surface water and royalties. On the royalty side, specifically, TPL is well positioned to consolidate a vast opportunity set of Permian Minerals and Royalties. Our current royalty position of 500,000 gross royalty acres provides unique advantages spanning across both the Midland and Delaware portions of the Permian Basin. With our industry-leading actively managed surface and water business, we have developed deep relationships with virtually every upstream, midstream and water operator as well as land and mineral estate owners across the basin, giving TPL unique access to off-market packages and extensive intel [ph] on development patterns. For potential mineral and royalty acquisitions, we evaluate each package with a bottoms-up intrinsic value approach. The goal with any acquisition is to generate at least double-digit IRRs on invested capital and to generate increased long-term free cash flow per share. Because TPL already owns great assets, we have no interest in diluting down our asset quality, our growth prospects or our unique business model. Any asset acquisition has to enhance the quality of our overall asset portfolio. It has to augment our growth runway. It has to support our high-margin capital life business model and ultimately, it has to increase TPL's intrinsic value per share. To this end, we employ an excellent team across M&A, reservoir engineering, GIS and minerals and royalties management, all with extensive industry experience. We have internally developed robust technology-driven data management systems that allow us to efficiently process, monitor and manage our mineral and royalty assets, which means we can roll out mineral and royalty assets in a very efficient manner without a proportionate increase in costs. The opportunity set for minerals and royalties is quite large. Although TPL's royalty acreage overlaps with some of the highest quality subregions in the Permian, there is still plenty of opportunity to consolidate royalties, both within our existing acreage footprint, but also within other Permian subregions that also contain excellent resource quality. Just within our existing asset footprint, we can buy royalties that are literally identical to what we already own. For example, in our core Texas Northern Delaware acreage, our typical royalty interest for a 1 mile by 1 mile section is generally 116th [ph] or 6.25%. With well laterals today typically extending out to 2 miles, a common drilling section unit or DSU is generally comprised of 2 adjacent sections. Thus for a 2-mile well lateral, our section would be one half of that DSU. So our net revenue interest in that would be one half of 6.25%, resulting in a net revenue interest of 3.125%. In the state of Texas, where the vast majority of mineral and royalty rights are privately owned, the total aggregate mineral and royalty interest is generally 25%. TPL's average net revenue interest across our entire portfolio is likely between 1% and 2%, which means that the other 23 or so percent are held by third parties. In other words, just on the DSUs that overlap with existing TPL royalty acreage, third-party ownership of those minerals and royalties is approximately 10 times TPL's net ownership. Looking beyond our current royalty footprint on the Midland side of the Permian, TPL's royalty position is much more fragmented with much smaller net revenue interest compared to our Texas Northern Delaware footprint. There are numerous subregions within the Midland that contains superb shale reserves where TPL does not have a meaningful position and adding resources here could be just as lucrative and high quality as our current portfolio. On the Delaware side, TPL's core Texas Northern Delaware royalty position stopped at the state line of Texas and New Mexico. Arguably the biggest and most lucrative wells in TPL's portfolio reside in this region. However, the excellent geology that lies under our Texas position extends well into New Mexico, where TPL does not currently own royalties. The resource quality on the New Mexico side is every bit as good as the Texas side and the rock there is widely considered some of the absolute best shale reserves found anywhere in North America, potentially adding mineral and royalty resources there would further high-grade our current royalty position. One last way to contemplate the sheer size of the overall consolidation opportunities to consider that the Permian currently produces north of 6 million barrels of crude oil per day. Assuming that the aggregate mineral and royalty interest held by third parties is around 20% across Texas and New Mexico and excluding production on federal and state lands would imply that roughly 1 million barrels per day of crude oil production is held by private mineral and royalty owners. Contrast that with TPL's current net crude oil royalty production of approximately 11,000 barrels per day. In other words, TPL's royalty production, ourselves one of the largest royalty owners in the country still only represents a miniscule fraction of the total production accruing to mineral and royalty owners in the Permian. In summary, we believe Permian oil and gas royalties are some of the most attractive assets investors can own. The opportunity set to acquire high-quality mineral and royalty assets is immense. And with TPL's extensive network and deep relationships from our legacy royalty and surface ownership, we have a unique combination of off-market deal access, technical wherewithal and a fortress balance sheet to roll out Permian minerals and royalties that public equity investors would not otherwise have access to. As our current royalty and surface footprint is already a free cash flow machine and with plenty of runway for future growth, we can remain selective. We don't need to acquire anything to grow. Any M&A pursuits can be purely opportunistic. We can discerningly consolidate assets that will enhance the company's intrinsic value per share, and we can and will remain disciplined. This has been the same strategy we've deployed for years now, and it's one that has served TPL and our shareholders well. And now as the Permian has emerged as an unequivocally world-class resource basin, TPL has never been in a better position to beneficially exploit this tailwind in our own backyard. Finally, I want to give shareholders a heads up that TPL will be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange next Monday, August 12. TPL common stock and its predecessor subshares from our trustees have been listed on the NYSE since June 27, 1888, making this our 136-year anniversary. We're told by the NYSE that TPL is their seventh longest listed company. This also comes off our recent inclusion into the S&P 400, which is another great milestone. There are not many companies that have had a history as long-standing or colorful as TPL. And even though TPL may be one of the oldest public companies in existence, there's still a lot to be excited about for our future. The enterprise today is as strong and as profitable as it's ever been. The opportunity set has never been greater, and the company is primed to last another 100-plus years. With that, I'll hand the call over to Chris. Chris Steddum : Thanks, Ty. Consolidated revenues during the second quarter of 2024 were approximately $172 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $153 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 89%. Diluted earnings per share was $4.98, which represents 14% year-over-year growth. Performance year-over-year was driven by high royalty production, water sales and produced water royalties. As discussed last quarter, weak natural gas prices at the Waha hub, which is the local pricing hub in West Texas led to low realized natural gas prices. Average benchmark Waha prices during second quarter 2024 were negative, and that negative pricing has persisted into early third quarter so far. Weak pricing is in a large part due to insufficient natural gas pipeline capacity out of the Permian Basin. However, the Matterhorn natural gas pipeline is expected in service later this year and once in service, we would expect to see reduced locational basis differentials. Last June, we announced that we had set a target cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $700 million. Above this targeted level, TPL will seek to deploy the majority of its free cash flow towards share repurchases and dividends. In conjunction with this announcement, we also declared a $10 per share special dividend. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the second quarter 2024 as of June 30 was approximately $895 million, though the $10 per share special dividend was paid in July with a total outlay of approximately $230 million. The target cash balance is intended to provide a framework and some predictability on how the company will allocate cash. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. Even beyond this most recent special dividend, the company still retains tremendous optionality to return additional capital to stockholders and to invest in attractive growth opportunities. We're very much in a position of strength to maximize shareholder value, and we're excited about the opportunities and option value our business can generate. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nate Pendleton with Texas Capital. Please proceed with your question. Nate Pendleton : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Starting on the quarter, you posted really strong revenue and volume numbers for both water sales and produced water. Can you speak to the drivers of the sequential increases we are seeing there? And can you touch on the sustainability of those results given the couple of quarters of increases? Tyler Glover : Yes, Nate, thanks for the question. I think on the source water side, 73% of our sales this quarter were off of our footprint outside of TPL's acreage. So that number continues to grow. We were over 70% last quarter as well. So the team has done a really good job of just expanding our reach, selling water further and further outside of our footprint. The team has also done a really good job of building additional storage and infrastructure that's allowing us to sell more barrels per day. And then I think just with simul-frac and trimul-frac, the volumes needed delivered to location are continuing to grow. And that's a real advantage for us because we're one of the few water service operators that have the ability to actually supply those kind of volumes. I think on the produced water side, we've had a few new tie-ins this quarter that brought some water in. But a lot of that additional volume is in areas where we have existing contracts. And so we're seeing some really robust activity in those areas where we've got some of those larger AMI style [ph] agreements that we've talked about in the past. And then with co completions, you're just -- you're seeing some lumpier volumes as well, and we're very well positioned to take those volumes. We've got a lot of active capacity, a lot of permitted capacity. And so there's definitely some room to grow from an infrastructure standpoint. And even though we don't operate that infrastructure, our BD and water teams do a great job of making sure we're working with our water midstream partners to make sure that additional capacity is available for operators in those areas to meet their needs and make sure we don't bottleneck. So I think it is sustainable. We've had a really strong first half of the year. I think we'll continue to see good pace of development. Back half of the year could be a little softer than the first half, but I think overall, we're setting up to have a really nice 2024, both on the source water and the produced water side. Nate Pendleton : Definitely. Thanks for all that detail. And regarding the increasing net well inventory you referenced in your prepared remarks, how do you view the outlook for activity in the near term? And can you speak to how you expect the oil cut to trend over time? Chris Steddum : Hey, Nate. This is Chris. Yes, when we look at that near-term inventory, it's obviously very encouraging, and it sets us up for a lot of potential growth over the near term. Now obviously, a lot of those DUCs and permits have to be converted. But I think the good news is, like we said, we have 4 cups and those tend to come on fairly quickly and the checks get in the mail a few months after that. So that -- I think that speaks to a strong position for the remainder of the year and the permits and DUCs if those get converted ought to present a pretty strong position for the beginning of 2025. As far as the oil cut, I think something kind of in the mid-40% is a pretty reasonable number to expect. It can bump around. As new wells come on, they tend to have higher oil cuts and then over time, oil decreases. But overall, we've consistently kind of been in that mid-40% oil cut range. And I think that's a pretty reasonable place to expect it to continue over the near term. Nate Pendleton : Got it. Thank you. And going back to the prepared remarks regarding the minerals A&D [ph] market. Can you provide some perspective on what the ideal deal sizes your team is looking at and some of the key criteria that your team is using to assess potential deals across the portfolio? Tyler Glover : Yes. I mean I would say we're definitely more focused on deal quality than deal size. I mean, some deals are small enough. They're not worth the brain damage and your larger deals have less competition. But again, just to reinforce, we're focused more on deal quality than deal size. Nate Pendleton : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Regarding recent earthquakes in the Permian, can we get your perspective on what you're hearing from the industry and any potential impacts on your acreage that you can speak to? Tyler Glover : Yes. There was recently a 5.0 in Scurry County, which is a good way is probably 100 miles for many of our closest operations. So we haven't been affected by that one. Robert Crain is on the call. I'll kick that over to you, Robert, just to talk about some of the others that we've had and kind of how you view that in relation to our operations. Robert Crain : Yes. Thanks, Ty. Real quick on the Scurry Counties, as I mentioned, good distance away from any of our operational areas. Road Commission is investigating. And I think it's in nature, it's going to be a little bit different from some of the seismic activity that you see more in our acreage mainly due to the lower water injection rates over there and a possible contribution from EOR activities that are occurring in that area. But when we go back to the historic seismic activity that we've seen in the Delaware and the Midland Basin, on a significant decline. The operators and regulators worked very well together to identify the cause of those being deep disposal and you've seen significant curtailments and shut-ins of the majority of deep disposal wells and all of the contributing deep-disposal wells, its been a benefit to us. As you've seen now those deep disposal volumes need to go into more shallow formations, a good deal of which are located on our properties. Nate Pendleton : That's really encouraging. Thanks for all that color. And then last one for me. Regarding your prior announcement to target cash position of $700 million on the balance sheet. Can you provide some perspective on how you arrived at that level and how the team makes the decision between using that cash for share buybacks or dividends for a given period? Chris Steddum : Yes. Nate, this is Chris. I think the way that we've kind of targeted the absolute number is just thinking about opportunistically how much cash would you want to have to kind of be -- to be effective in the market. And that could be both for potential buybacks as well as potential M&A. And we felt like that level of cash gave us a significant advantage in the market that if there were great opportunities out there, we would be in a position to act quickly on them. And then as far as like how it gets deployed, I think we've spent a lot of time talking about it, but it's really just fundamentally return driven. We're looking to see where we can get the best risk-adjusted returns. And if that's buybacks, we're going to put more of that money toward buybacks if that's potentially adding third-party acreage, whether it's surface, royalties, water related, we're going to try to put more of that money there. And if we think that neither of those two opportunities are sufficiently attractive, then a lot of times that gets moved toward a dividend. So that's kind of the framework that we've tried to always use is try to put it towards the best risk-adjusted returns. And again, like we said, once we feel like we kind of have that sufficient capital to be competitive and effective, then at that point, it just makes sense to return all the remaining excess cash flow, which continues to be very robust to our shareholders. Nate Pendleton : Makes sense. Appreciate your time. Tyler Glover : Thanks, Nate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please proceed with your question. Hamed Khorsand : Hey, good morning. So my first question was regarding the -- your intention or evaluation of acquiring more royalty interest. Is it feasible to actually acquire anything in the Permian, just given what you've said, it is a premier asset area? Or are you trying to leverage the lower nat gas prices at the moment to find deals out there? Tyler Glover : Good morning, Hamed. Thanks for the question. The Permian is a premier basin, but we're still seeing a lot of opportunity to acquire high-quality assets, like I talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks. A lot of those assets are within the same footprint that we already own a lot of times in the same DSU. And so that market is still very fragmented, and there are a lot of interest trading hands. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of opportunity on that front. And with the intelligence that we gained through our surface and water business and access to off-market deals, I think we've got an advantage on a lot of other buyers in the basin as well. Hamed Khorsand : Okay. And then on the water segment side, what is the -- is it -- what is the issue? Is it competition? Is it other sources as far as not being able to sell as much water to the people on your land that you have to go outside of your -- the area that you cover? Tyler Glover : Well, I think if I understand your question correctly, is there competition for wells being completed on our land. I think to answer that, the reason that we're selling more and more water off of our footprint is just to expand the business, capture more of the overall Permian market. So we're still sourcing a ton of completions and providing volumes on our land. We just continue to expand our infrastructure and network to sell more water off of our land, and that's how we've been able to capture more of the overall market to increase our overall daily production and sales, and that's why you're seeing the increase in revenue. And a big shout out to the team, the water team and the BD team, I think we started last year at roughly 50% of our sales were off of our footprint, and they've been able to grow that to 73% this quarter. So they've done a tremendous job there. Hamed Khorsand : Great. Thank you. Tyler Glover : Thanks, Hamed. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And with that, the conclusion of today's call. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shawn Amini, VP Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Shawn Amini : Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that may affect the company's results, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our recent SEC filings.

More information and reconciliations about these non-GAAP financial measures are contained in our earnings release and SEC filings. Please also note, we may at times refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL. This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and TPL's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. Now I will turn the call over to Ty. Tyler Glover : Thanks, Shawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our strong third quarter 2024 performance underscores the success of our active management strategy focused on maximizing oil and gas royalties, surface and water assets with acquisition activity over the last couple of years set to provide incremental growth tailwinds. In addition, TPL continues to benefit from activity levels in the Permian Basin, which remain resilient despite fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. To start, TPL's oil and gas royalty production of approximately 28,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day represents a corporate record, driven by our Central Midland and oily Loving subregions. For water sales, revenues were up 37% year-over-year as the size and scale of our operations provide a meaningful competitive advantage as operator customers look for delivery assurance. Continued deployment of co completions and simul and trimul fracking placed tremendous volume demands for water delivered over a relatively short period and our substantial investment in brackish and treated water infrastructure has established one of the few systems in the Permian capable of this type of volume intensity. This was also another record quarter for our produced water royalty revenues with produced water royalty volumes up 46% year-over-year as our expanding set of commercial arrangements with third-party customers continues to drive increased market capture. In our conversations with investors, our produced water royalties is by far the most misunderstood aspect of our business. Today, I'd like to spend some time elaborating on this topic, especially given the growth we've seen to date and also given the robust outlook over the near term and long term, underpinned by acquisitions we made last year. Our produced water royalties business is often conflated with traditional saltwater midstream and disposal operations. In traditional saltwater disposal operations, otherwise known by its acronym, SWD, an operator will collect water produced via an oil and gas well at a centralized storage facility, transport it typically via pipeline to an SWD facility, where it is then injected thousands of feet below the surface. From a high level, TPL's role in the disposal of produced water is providing SWD operators access to our surface and our core space and in return, we charge a produced water royalty. TPL does not currently operate SWD infrastructure. To receive these produced water royalties, we have negotiated separate individualized commercial agreements with each operator that wants to operate SWD infrastructure on our land. These agreements often cover massive acreage extents and can take months or even years to negotiate. Since we started in 2017, the team has easily spent more hours negotiating, structuring and executing produced water royalty agreements than any other part of the business. The effort was well worth it as these produced water royalties provide TPL with a commercially unique, extremely high-quality cash flow stream. In 2016, before active management, TPL generated virtually 0 produced water royalties. Fast forward to today, and TPL is positioned to collect royalties on well over 1 billion barrels of produced water for the full year 2024, which will in turn generate around $100 million of royalty revenues. And because of how we've structured these agreements, this revenue stream incurs 0 capital expenditures and 0 operating expense burden outside of personnel salaries and legal expenses that go into negotiating the agreements. In effect, the hundreds of millions or likely billions of dollars this business will cumulatively generate in the years to come, flows directly to TPL's bottom line, representing nearly pure margin. By applying our historical earnings trading multiple to the current produced water royalties annualized run rate cash flow, it's easy to see the immense value this business has created for shareholders. It's also worth noting that our agreements provide TPL with extremely robust indemnification against spills, accidents, injuries or other types of liabilities. In addition to benefiting from the significant financial upside, we've also been very intentional in protecting TPL interest from potential risks. Furthermore, these produced water realty agreements enhance our water sales business. Many of our contracts include provisions providing TPL the exclusive right to offtake produced water barrels within an area of mutual interest for treatment and resale. This allows TPL to procure produced water from an operator's system, treat it to a customer's specifications and sell the recycled water for well completions. In such circumstances, TPL is paid twice on a single barrel, once through a produced water royalty and again through a treated water sale. This feature has been especially critical for TPL as operators have been increasingly using raw or treated produced water for well development over the last few years. Looking ahead, recent strategic acquisitions will provide incremental produced water growth opportunities. Last year, we spent nearly $40 million across multiple transactions to acquire over 50,000 acres of surface acreage and core space. These acquisitions were strategically targeted given their location along the East state line of Texas and Mexico in Andrews and Winkler counties. This location is significant as this acreage is outside the core oil and gas development areas of the Permian Basin, where produced water disposal zones will not interfere with drilling and completion operations. Over the last year, our business development teams have been working diligently to commercialize this otherwise raw land. We have since signed an agreement with one of the largest midstream operators serving the broader Delaware market to bring produced water into these new tracks with initial volumes expected in fourth quarter 2024. We are also in advanced discussions with other parties for additional access, and we expect that the aggregate contribution for current and future agreements will support multiple hundreds of thousands of produced water barrels per day. These strategic surface acquisitions play a critical role for TPL as we look to deliver produced water solutions for the broader oil and gas industry. At the same time, they generate substantial incremental cash flows for TPL and help ensure that our oil and gas royalty interests remain undeterred by development constraints. Next, I'd like to spend some time discussing our most recent acquisition activity that we announced this past August and October. In total, we closed on three separate transactions totaling nearly $0.5 billion. The first asset was over 4,000 surface acres in Martin County, which is strategically located in the core of the Midland Basin. These surface assets provide numerous revenue streams across brackish water, produced water and other surface-related activities. The next asset we closed on was over 4,000 net royalty acres standardized to an 1/8th located in Culberson County. This acquired acreage was especially attractive given the royalty acreage overlap drilling spacing units where we already have an interest in with our legacy royalties. Meaning we essentially acquired a higher net revenue interest in current and future well locations we already own. The third asset we closed on was over 7,000 net royalty acres located primarily in the Midland Basin in Martin, Midland and other counties. These assets represent some of the best geology for oil development found anywhere in the Lower 48 and it significantly expands our net royalty acreage on the Midland side of the Permian Basin. All of these assets, both individually and on an aggregate basis, high grades TPL's asset portfolio. These newly acquired assets are on par with or even exceed the quality of our legacy portfolio. They are expected to be highly accretive to our near-term financial and operating metrics on a per share basis while also enhancing and extending our growth runway given the remaining undeveloped inventory on the royalty acreage and the untapped commercial potential on the surface acreage. We expect the two royalty acquisitions to add upwards of approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the near term, which represents an over 10% increase to our current oil and gas royalty production. Aggregating all three deals, we expect them to generate double-digit cash flow yield at a flat $70 oil price. As a result of the overall business performance and the additional free cash flow per share accretion these acquisitions provide, we announced yesterday that the Board has approved a 37% increase of our regular quarterly dividend to $1.60 per share. We continue to identify acquisition opportunities that could be excellent additions to the TPL portfolio. Our team brings exceptional technical, financial and operating capabilities across land, water and royalties and with a fortress balance sheet and a net cash position coupled with our free cash flow proficiency, we are well positioned to evaluate, execute and consolidate high-quality assets. As always, we remain intently focused on maximizing intrinsic value per share with a disciplined capital allocation approach aimed on maximizing returns over the long term. Next, I want to provide an update on our desalination efforts. We are making progress with equipment procurement, manufacturing and testing as we work towards our 10,000 barrel per day test facility, which we refer to as Phase 2b. We still expect completion of this facility in the middle of next year. We have also advanced various operating optimizations, cost efficiencies and economic analysis. Currently, we expect the total cost of Phase 2b to be approximately $25 million, with $10 million incurred in 2024 and the remaining balance in 2025. As an alternative to a direct grid connection, we are also evaluating a direct natural gas power generation option with a tie-in to a nearby nat gas pipeline which would require additional capital investment of approximately $10 million. Negotiations are ongoing with third-party partners and customers as we evaluate various commercial structures. As we've discussed in the past, we believe produced water desalination and beneficial reuse will potentially play a critical role in providing sustainable produced water solutions that will allow the Permian to maintain robust development activity. And finally, I want to remind TPL shareholders that we will be having our annual meeting tomorrow in Dallas. If you haven't already, I would encourage shareholders to submit their proxy votes soon. You can find the generic proxy statement posted on the TPL website or via the SEC website. If you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations. With that, I'll hand the call over to Chris. Chris Steddum : Thanks, Ty. Consolidated revenues during the third quarter 2024 were approximately $174 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $144 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 83%. Diluted earnings per share was $4.63, which was up slightly versus the same period last year. Performance year-over-year benefited from higher oil and gas royalty production, which increased 29%, higher water sales volumes, which increased 32%, and higher produced water royalty volumes which increased 46%. Results were offset by lower realized oil and natural gas prices, which declined by 8% and 65%, respectively. Royalty production of approximately 28,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day represents 13% growth on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. Production continues to benefit from strong activity levels across our Northern Delaware and Midland Basin footprint with strong contributions from Exxon, Occidental, Coterra, BP and Diamondback. Our recent M&A activity that closed during the third quarter 2024 added approximately 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day and $3 million of cash flow. As Ty mentioned earlier, on a full quarterly run rate basis we expect our recent royalty and minerals acquisitions to add over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an approximate 50% oil cut and the rest split relatively evenly between gas and NGLs. As of quarter end, we had 6.9 net permitted wells, 11.8 net drilled but uncompleted wells and 3.4 net completed but not producing wells. That amounts to 22.1% net line of sight inventory, which is the highest ever for TPL. The recent minerals and royalties acquisitions that closed in October is not reflected in the well statistics. We anticipate this acquisition to add approximately 1.5 net wells to our line of sight inventory. While we continue to monitor activity on our acreage and in the broader Permian amid recent commodity price volatility, current activity levels remain robust from our vantage point. Finally, our balance sheet remains incredibly strong with 0 debt and in a net cash position. While commodity prices are beyond our control, we remain focused on maximizing value where we can. The business has been set up to thrive in virtually any commodity price environment and regardless of which way the macroeconomic environment unfolds, TPL will be operating from a position of strength and will look to be opportunistic. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield from [Texas Pacific Land Corporation]. Derrick Whitfield : Congrats on your quarter and recent acquisitions. Tyler Glover : Thanks, Derek. Derrick Whitfield : Starting on M&A, could you help frame what led you to be more active as of recent and your view on the opportunity set that meets your checklist? Tyler Glover : Yes, sure. I think we've talked about it for the last couple of years, like we have a lot of interest in owning more assets that look just like what we own today. I mean we love surface, minerals, water. The overall environment has been pretty good for M&A lately where commodity prices are, sellers are willing to sell, and it's an attractive time to buy. So those deals were directly sourced, nonmarketed deals, but just really attractive asset classes, high-quality long-duration cash flows, very similar to what we own today. I mean a lot of the interest we bought was actually in DSUs that we already own. So some intelligence there on development timing and pretty easy to manage when you're just going in and changing decimal places in the database that we already have. So again, just really high quality, very attractive assets that are really easy to integrate into our management system. Derrick Whitfield : Terrific. And then maybe shifting over to the surface side of the business. I mean there's been a tremendous uptick in interest in surface rights since the LandBridge IPO. Given that you guys own one of the largest surface acre spreads in Texas, could you speak to the level of non-oil and gas revenue you're generating to date and the potential you see in opportunities surrounding AI, data centers, renewable energy, crypto mining, et cetera? Tyler Glover : Yes. I mean surface is a fantastic asset. I think the thing we like about it the most is just the optionality that you have. Minerals are a great asset as well, but you don't have as much control over the actual development. Whereas surface, you can be more proactive and kind of have more control over how and when that asset is developed. So as far as non-oil and gas revenue, it's pretty immaterial today, but we've signed a lot of contracts in the last couple of years. I think we've got over 700 megawatts of solar that we've contracted in the last 24 months that's in development phases. We've got seven utility-scale battery projects going. I think we've got four Bitcoin mines, like 78 megawatts that are active today with another 50 in development stages. So I think there's a lot of opportunity outside of oil and gas. We've seen an increase in wind power interest lately. And then there's been a lot of talk about data centers, as you know, I think Diamondback and Permian Resources have mentioned that lately. But that's something that we've been working on for some time now. And if you think about data centers as compute centers, then we've actually got a couple of small compute centers in the form of Bitcoin mining, like I mentioned, that are up and running with a couple more in negotiations. So we know what it takes to negotiate these things and every deal is unique, but if you think about the large data center you might see for hyperscalers, those are still in the early days of development for the Permian. And I would just say that there's a lot of conversations taking place within the industry and definitely within TPL. And we feel that we're positioned as well as anyone in West Texas to provide land and water solutions as those opportunities unfold. And so we've got a lot of experience negotiating and contracting compute facilities, but also all the things that might be ancillary to a data center, things like solar, wind, gas generation, pipeline and electric easements, water, grid-scale batteries, like I mentioned, and carbon capture. So we've signed contracts. We're cash flowing along a lot of those items already today. So again, TPL just has a lot of positive attributes for data centers and nobody has more land than us in West Texas. So another thing, too, is if we need to buy more land to accommodate a data center, then we have proven that, that's not hard for us to do so. I think there's also a lot of other parts of the country that are also attractive for data centers. So we're working hard to make TPL as attractive as possible. But again, we're just -- we're having a lot of good discussions, and we'll definitely update you guys along the way. Derrick Whitfield : Terrific. And maybe just staying on water. A few of your midstream peers are pursuing mineral extraction opportunities with iodine and lithium. Is there a royalty opportunity for you guys on that front? Tyler Glover : Robert, do you want to take that one? Robert Crain : Yes, sure. We talk about beneficial extraction of the produced water. A lot of folks are chasing it. I think those conversations are very similar to the very early stages of large data centers, judging that opportunity. What we've done, I'll say, from a long time out is to start identifying and cataloging by strata and by spatial area, what those concentrations are and in a compounded in a raw and then in a compounded environment, is that marketable? We -- I think we have a good line of sight internally on what are those analytes that can be compounded in our commercial at scale. And we continue to evaluate it. And then conversations regarding that, whatever beneficial use comes of that water and how that goes into play. I think it's still developing in the regulatory world on ownership of produced water and is going to kind of to be determined on the ownership of produced water and any downstream revenues that are associated with it. Derrick Whitfield : And finally, if I could, just referencing the new midstream agreement you mentioned in your prepared remarks that will bring additional produced water in Q4. How material of a step-up in SWD volumes is that? Tyler Glover : I think that contract is a couple of hundred thousand barrels a day. And if you look at our run rate, we're just under 4 million barrels a day on average today. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference of Texas Pacific Land Corporation has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
